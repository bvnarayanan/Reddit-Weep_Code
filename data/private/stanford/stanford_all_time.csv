I am currently a 2nd year student at one of the California community colleges and looking to transfer into Stanford in the future. Up until now I have been taking part-time units each semester because I have been working full time, but now I have decided become full time student so that I can transfer sooner.
From what I've read, I already know the transfer rate to Stanford is very slim but I am going to go for it anyways. Which brings me to my dilemma... To make it brief, transfer admission counselor at Stanford told me that the transfer counselor at my school would know exactly how to plan my courses in order to be a competitive applicant. However the transfer counselor at my school doesn't really know what he's doing and is not being very helpful, which leaves me with no clue on how I should prepare my courses for Stanford. Currently I am following the my major's transfer agreement plan for my other schools in UC's and CSU's.

I am looking to see how other successful transfer academic transfer plan looks like so that I could get some idea. And if you have some other helpful advice I’d like to hear about it as well.

As for me, I want to transfer as a major in Industrial Engineering at other colleges and a major in MS&amp;E at Stanford.

Even if you've not transferred as MS&amp;E I would still like to know how you've done it because I also would like to see the kind of rigor the admissions are looking for in transcripts... Oh and extracurricular too!

Thank You for Reading, Have a Wonderful, No-Rain Sunday!

What my transfer courses plan currently looks like:

Calculus: 1, 2, 3

Linear and Diff Equations

English Writing and Advanced English writing

Calculus Based Physics and Chemistry

Speech, Economics, Business

Computer programming: Java, C++, MATLAB

Some elective engineering courses

Some IGETC stuff to fill semester units

I wrote an appeal and even attached a photo of my ""A"" permit to clearly indicate that I did have it... however, I just saw that they said ""Review - Upheld. Hold until xx/xx/2017."" 

I'm assuming that means they want to uphold my parking ticket. Is there any way I can talk to a campus officer or someone else about this? I feel like it's very reasonable and it feels very manipulative that they gave me a ticket for no reason. The next step seems to be an administrative hearing (for which the amount has to be paid in full) and that seems like a lot of hassle for something like this. Just looking to see if there's another way I can go about getting this waived, as I did have the permit.

7pe16s,https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/7pe16s/stanford_undergrad_admissions_assistant_director/,Stanford Undergrad Admissions Assistant Director Caught Liking her own Instagram Pictures with Official Stanford Admissions Account [Link in Comments],55,38,2018-01-09 23:27:23,"Assistant Director of Undergraduate Admissions Karen Alonzo, the Admission Officer for Pennsylvania and parts of Florida, was recently caught posting unprofessional and inappropriate things on her personal Instagram, which until recently was public. Alonzo's posts included profanity, photos of alcoholic drinks, and this caption on an Aug. 15 photo of an ice cream cone:

""I like my🍦 #black ... like my men ♥😶""

According to her Linkedin profile Alonzo manages the official social media accounts for Stanford Admissions, including the office's Instagram account. Alonzo used the official Stanford Admissions account to like many of her personal posts.

Yes, that's right: for months, the official Instagram account for the most selective school in America was liking posts such as: ""Fucking up my snap b. 😩 😒 ,"" ""Bad bihh in LA...told me that she'll make the trip #throwbacktuesday,"" and ""#B*tches love foliage 🤷🏽‍♀️🍁🍂  "" as well as the one about #black cones.

[Link to the full gallery here](https://imgur.com/a/B3YpX). 

One tipster suggested that Alonzo's preference for #black men, along with other things revealed in her Instagram posts, might have influenced who she admitted to Stanford. Given that Alonzo's posts included captions such as ""Unfriendly minority hotties,"" we think this is a valid concern.

However, the biggest issue we see here is that Alonzo's behavior was just shockingly, astonishingly unprofessional — not to mention incredibly stupid. Posting this stuff on your own public Instagram is bad enough. But liking your own posts with an official Stanford University account? Come on.

This doesn't exactly inspire confidence in Stanford admissions officers' intelligence. And as we all know, 40,000+ hopeful young applicants count on said admissions officers' intelligence every year. (It doesn't reflect well on Stanford grads' intelligence either, for that matter: Alonzo is a class of '11 STS grad.)

FoHo reached out to Alonzo and Dean Shaw of Admissions for comment, and all we got in reply was an auto-responder from Alonzo indicating that she's currently very busy evaluating applications.

(Sorry in advance for the longish post. Basically just writing this to put this out there.)



I guess I'm one of those few Stanford folks who came out of the whole undergrad experience with no core group of friends. I was involved in one of the community centers and a dance group through my undergrad, but I didn't necessarily foster the closest of friendships in those spaces. I have some scattered friends, here and there, but only 3-4 people from different parts of my time there who I can actually reach out to, talk to, and hang out with comfortably. But even then, they have their own respective core groups in which they do things with (Stanford events, group hangouts, travelling, weddings, etc).

I thought I had a friend group starting my freshmen year, but it turned out that they were only friends with me because I dated one of them (even though they all assured me that that wasn't the case). The entire group, including my bf at the time, was full of upperclassmen. We would all go to events together, go camping, go on adventures, do bbqs, and always hang out with one another. Skip to my 3rd year, I broke up with my bf. It was an amicable one that everyone supported me in. Then senior year came along and I stopped getting invited to things.

If this wasn't already a big enough blow to my self-esteem and self-worth, my senior year was fraught with disappointments and isolation. Because I missed the whole friendship boat with other folks in my class year, I didn't have a core group of friends to go to senior events with. I tried going to some with different people I had met during my Stanford career, but we weren't really close friends so it was often just awkward socialization. Senior Formal was rough, as was Senior Dinner on the Quad, because I awkwardly invited myself to crash two different friend groups. I was kind of the oddball out and it was painfully obvious to everyone. After both of these nights, I remember walking home and sobbing because of how lonely I felt.

Fast-forward to now, as a recent alum, I'm trying to tell myself that it's okay that I didn't find a core group of friends (my year or otherwise). I know I'll probably never go to reunion events because I don't really have anyone to go with and I don't even have many fond friendship memories to be nostalgic over anyways.

I'm just struggling with friendships now because I feel like people just don't want to be around me. I don't know how to act and make friends anymore. And I'm really insecure about it because I really, honestly, can't make sense of why. In high school, I had a lot of really good, really close friends, and I'm still good friends with a handful of them today. During my early undergraduate years, I was talkative and could hang out with a bunch of people no problem, and (not to be cocky) people told me upfront that I was likeable and friendly. Now, I struggle with anxiety and depression and can barely form sentences with new people.

Mental health aside, my heart hurts knowing that I didn't find a ""forever family"" at Stanford, like so many others have. I'm grateful for the 3-4 that I get to talk to every once in a while, but it just seems like I missed the whole ""college friends forever"" thing that everyone else seemed to catch up on.


If you have any advice/reassurance you can give, or stories about yourself or someone you know who has gone through the same thing, please feel free to share. I would really appreciate it."

In my financial aid package, I noticed that I would have to contribute during the school year and summer. How do students usually meet this contribution? My concern is I won't end up being able to handle the workload and working a job at the same time. My parents will just end up paying my contribution for the school year at least right? They can afford it either way: I just wanted to at least try to contribute to the cost of my education. 

I am also majoring in the humanities or social sciences. Will I be okay doing that at Stanford? Sometimes I felt left out of the innovation and startup culture present on campus. I ultimately want to prepare myself for law school, but I wanted to do Econ instead of Poli Sci. I guess I'd have to talk to my academic advisor about that.  

Another thing I'm considering is stress culture. I only have concerns about it because I'll be thousands of miles away from home. Other than that I felt welcomed at Stanford and like the students were happy even though everyone keeps telling me that it was just an act for admit weekend. I still can't explain my love for the seemingly vibrant campus though.

If any current/previous Stanford students whose families live on the east coast (or any similarly distant location) could provide insight, it would be preferred. However, any answers to any of the following questions would still be much appreciated!
-How often do you visit home each year, and for what reasons?
-Do you live on campus or off campus? How much do decent off-campus residences generally cost?
-Do you spend your summers at home?
-If you go home for the summer, what do you do with all of your belongings? Do you transport them back and forth or do you have some way to leave the bigger stuff in CA?
-How much money would you estimate you spend on travel each year? How many trips/how far does this get you?
-Does Stanford (or do any universities, for that matter) offer any aid or compensation for travel there and back?
-From your knowledge, would you say that the personal expenses (leisure, clothes, toiletries, etc.) are significantly more expensive around Stanford than around other universities?
-Did you visit Stanford before applying? Before accepting and enrolling?
-Was there a culture shock or big adjustment in moving to California from your native area? How did this compare to your expectations? Was the difference generally good or bad? Do you feel that you assimilated well?

Recently I got an offer for Stanford's IHP program next summer 2019. I am a 3rd year Computer Science undergraduate, with focus in Robotics and recently delving into ML/AI. So far I am considering the following things to do :

1. Silicon Valley Innovation Academy (SVIA). What are your thoughts and opinions about this? Is it worth spending extra fee into this program?
2. Research opportunities : Is there any undergraduate research program with the professors offered during this period? I'm also thinking if I can meet some of the professors to have some research projects.
3. Internships around Stanford : Also wondering any websites or communities I can look up for applying internships near Stanford if possible. The internship distance is also one of my considerations since I am enrolling in classes if I accept the program.
4. I also read some threads about the summer session so far, but some are for high schools. In general, is the IHP program for undergraduates worth it?

* I know that CAPS/Bridge exist, but I’ve only ever heard negative reviews about them like limited treatment or long wait times. It’s very possible that the majority of cases are well-handled, so I would never hear about them. Any thoughts?
* this person is low income and I know healthcare in US is expensive so that’s another constraint

“***The Manic Monologues***” is a play consisting of diverse, true stories of mental illness, performed for the first time at **Stanford May 2-4, 2019**. Mental illness is taboo, even here in the Bay Area. 

When Zack Burton experienced a psychotic break and bipolar diagnosis as a Ph.D. student at Stanford, his co-founder (Elisa Hofmeister, Stanford Medicine) and he were struck by the absence of relatable experiences. 1 in 4 Americans experiences a mental health condition in any given year, *so why isn’t there conversation?*

Zack and Elisa are working with a Canadian performer featured in *NYT, CNN, WSJ* and who previously acted alongside Johnny Depp and John Travolta; a fmr. advisor to Netflix’s “*13 Reasons Why*” and psychiatrist at Stanford; an editor of *NYT* bestsellers and two Pulitzer Prize-winning stories; an Emmy Award-winning journalist and medical doctor; a Professor of Psychology at UC Berkeley, Psychiatry at UCSF, and author of *Another Kind of Madness: A Journey Through the Stigma and Hope of Mental Illness*; and a playwright and Pulitzer finalist.

This play features brave stories from people across the world. These stories convey struggle and pain, but also humor, triumph, and joy. The stories we share aim to spread awareness and to disrupt stigma. Because stigma can be more fatal than mental illness itself.

I have ""taught"" a few undergrads, grad students and even alumni over the last couple of semesters, and they've loved my approach. The setting is informal (and free!)- lots of discussion, hand waving and trying to look at fundamental ideas in a different and more intuitive way.

**I'm trying to find people interested in getting together and learning about Vector Cal or Linear Algebra. Same setting, no cost.**

For Vec Cal: I will focus on geometric interpretations of the gradient, divergence and curl operations, and give a gentle introduction to line/surface integrals in scalar and vector fields.

For Lin Al: NO FORMULAE OR ALGORITHMS! I'll will talk about what the 4 spaces really mean (Null, Column, etc etc), Eigen everything, transformations, all from a geometric perspective.

This is pitched towards folks who have been introduced to/ work with vector calculus and linear algebra and are looking for another perspective on the subject. Something beyond algorithmic calculations of these operations.

I’m a CS major, but most of my friends are in the humanities (history, philosophy, etc), and when we talk about and debate hot topics, they always are able to present these well-formed arguments with multiple points of evidence/substantiation, and have also often already anticipated various counterarguments. The issue is not that I know less about these topics than them (because the debates are often about normative questions); it’s more like I take a (not so well thought out) stance on a topic based on my gut feeling, but then have issues defending my view when they ask probing questions. To give some concrete examples, some recent hot topics up for debate are “should Kurt Mitman’s (new visiting professor at Stanford) sex offender status (due to crimes he committed over a decade ago) have been exposed by the FoHo/other campus publications?”, “should need blind be extended to international students?”, “pros/cons of the new ResX housing system?”.

I guess since my friends are humanities majors, the bulk of their work is intaking information on a subject and forming a novel thought/opinion, and then defending their stance, whereas the bulk of my work is coding assignments. So, it’s no surprise that they’re really good at debating topics whereas my strengths are more quantitative in nature. I wonder how I can get better at thinking critically and debate? Maybe there are some classes or clubs or something? I tried out for the debate society at one point, but didn’t make it, so I guess that pathway is closed. I also don’t have a huge amount of time to commit (probably max 3-7 hours per week). I’ve taken some a few laidback humanities classes for WAYS where I had to write an argumentative paper and debate with classmates during section (e.g. History 47 with James Campbell), and I think they were a nice way to gain some critical thinking skills without having a stressful workload, so some suggestions would be welcome."
blecqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/blecqx/how_useful_is_it_to_have_a_secondary_major/,How useful is it to have a secondary major?,16,7,2019-05-06 09:33:02,"I really want to do Symbolic Systems, but I also want to do CS.  I feel that symsys won't give me a strong enough core in CS, but the 'science of mind' aspect of symsys is something I also don't want to leave behind. Also, symsys would close many doors that CS would leave open.

Clearly, double majoring in these two is practically impossible and not very useful because of the huge overlap. However, there's the option to chose one of those as a secondary major. So,

• What is the overall utility of having a secondary major?

• Is it relevant that the secondary major is not on the diploma, only on the transcript?

• Does having a secondary major leave that major's opportunities available (i.e. grad school and job opportunities)?"

* Teaching: I have TA'ed several different classes, both as an undergrad and a grad student. I also lectured (as the primary instructor) for CS 110 (our Unix systems class) last summer.
* Internships and software engineering: I've worked in a national lab (Sandia), at a startup (Expanse), at a big company (Facebook), at a nonprofit (Khan Academy), and started my own startup in a past life.

I got accepted to Stanford and got my financial aid letter thru email today. im low income so they basically covered everything, and the only thing I have to pay is the 5k thru work study (which I think everyone on financial aid has to do). in my cost of attendance, they included a personal expense allowance and transition expenses. is stanford going to provide me w this money, or are they just telling me to be conscious and budget wisely? I know they’re giving me money for travel, because I live on the other side of the country, but I don’t think they would give me money to buy stuff that’s not school related. any help would be greatly appreciated :)"

I recently got admitted into my two dream schools, Stanford and Yale, however, now I seem to be unable to make a decision. A lot of people have told me to go with my gut, but I can’t visit due to COVID-19 so it’s pretty difficult for me to have a gut feeling. That being said, I was wondering if anyone had any advice that they could give me in terms of choosing between the two schools.
I’m planning to probably do something within STEM, maybe computer science, but I’m also planning to explore throughout college and I figure that I’ll probably change what I want to study throughout the course of the 4 years. 
I’m curious if comp sci/STEM is extremely competitive and/or miserable at Stanford (as I know it can be at other top tier schools) and as someone who is not yet really good at programming if I’ll be able to survive/thrive. Also, I know that Yale has residential colleges to build community and I was wondering if Stanford has anything similar/if the community and support at Stanford is strong. I also have really strong interests beyond STEM in the humanities (ie poetry, mythology) and was wondering to what extent STEM students are encouraged to explore humanities at Stanford.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

Can you easily balance RAing for an older dorm with spending time with friends, classwork, clubs, and events on campus, or is it something that will take up most of your time?

Well, there's an argument to be made for strategic value for sure, although we're certainly big enough to hold our own. It doesn't hurt that the team invading you is Michigan, a team that is also at war with us. But I tell you, that is not the reason I am here today. Nor is it the fact that y'all are the last team standing from the Pac-12 and have held your own in the forests of Northern California for many, many turns.

I come to you not as an ally (we are neutral with Stanford, as we are with many teams not named Michigan or *that orange school*), and not as an Aggie, but as a shitposter. I simply want more of these memes. 

However, I'm sure I don't have to sit here and tell you that a you guys as a team of 40 players will struggle against Michigan, a team of 800. Presumably y'all have some newfangled Palo Alto style app for that. Or just tell your friends and fellow Stanford fans!

2. Any other Thinking Matters courses that are worth taking a look at? As of now, I'm probably going to take ""Our Genome"" or something because it matches my interests, but I'm also looking to explore. I'd love any recommendations!
3. How/when do we signup for introsems? I don't see the 2020-2021 introsems in the Approaching Stanford packet either, so where would we find them?
4. For anyone who studies BioE/has studied BioE, what's it like? I've heard BioE is super broad and isn't the best at helping you dive deep into one or a few areas, but I;m not sure, obviously, how true this is.
5. Thoughts on taking a heavy courseload first quarter? I.e. starting phys, chem, and math sequences right away and maybe even beginning to take BioE required courses

I don’t consider myself to be in ANY sort of way a chem wiz, and would prefer 31A/B because it seems more manageable. I would prefer 31M because it seems more convenient on the path to my major(MatSci prob.), provided it will likely be much more of a grind.

I'm an incoming (prob online so idk) freshman and just wanted to ask you people about the whole textbook situation at Stanford. I know that during the first few weeks of the quarter you can buy/rent ""used"" books from the Stanford Bookstore or order some off of Amazon. And adding up all the money spent on textbooks that I'll buy throughout college is huge.

So I have some money saved for college and wanted to get over with this whole textbook thing as cheap as possible. Given that I'll always BUY second-hand textbooks, will it be cheaper to actually get an IPad Pro (smth life $1100) and get all books as ebooks?

I'm thinking of majoring in Computer Science and maybe minor/ double major in MS&amp;E.

A quick calculation that I did: 3-4 books a quarter and each book avg. $40. 3.5 x 40 = $140 per quarter and 12 quarter \* 140 = $1680?"

gudml4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/gudml4/question/,Question,5,5,2020-05-31 21:08:18,"I was just wondering...

Could I apply to my state school if I were to defer my enrollment as an incoming frosh? I'm not quite sure about the deferment policy with Stanford. Before you judge, I know I'm in an extremely privileged position as someone who is admitted and I'm extremely grateful. However, I'm probably in a really unique position right now.

To sum it up, when I originally applied, I was living in California. However, due to unexpected circumstances, my family has no other choice but to move to another state. I'm 100% committed to going to Stanford, but with all that has been going on, I've pretty much made my mind to defer my enrollment until next year.

I'm just extremely worried about the possibility of my family's financial circumstances doing a 180 between now and next year. And to cover my ends, I just wanted to apply to my state school IN MY NEW STATE (as a more affordable option) just in case something were to happen.

Has anyone been through similar circumstances where they had to apply to another school during their deferred year or know anyone who has?

hltel6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/hltel6/faking_accomplishments_for_the_knight_hennessy/,Faking Accomplishments for the Knight Hennessy Scholarship (Stanford U's full scholarship),46,29,2020-07-05 13:17:58,"Greetings to the brilliant community at Stanford U. Hope you are all safe and doing fine.

My friends and I are new engineering graduates from a developing country of the world. In our university only a small community of students were passionately engaged in engineering, whereas the rest were there just to get an engineering degree. (I am not judging the rest. It is just how it is). We used to build solar cars and racing model planes etc and we were very well connected as a small community of engineering geeks.

During my third year our community heard that a boy in our University got in trouble for getting an article published in the city newspaper about an invention he faked. Let’s call this guy **“Frank”** (Inspired by the greatest conman Frank Abagnale). We engineering geeks had a good laugh about how Frank convinced the reporter that his invention could save the world by feeding her some gibberish technical words. In this part of the world such an act has no repercussions and he did not get affected by it. Lying, cheating, pirating, etc are common here but not taken seriously because we have bigger problems of our own.

About three months back we heard that Frank had received the 100% Knight Hennessey scholarship from Stanford U to pursue masters. We knew that Stanford U is the best University in the freaking world so this scholarship would be even more prestigious. But what we knew better was Frank must have done something shady again!

By just looking him up on the internet we got to know exactly what he had done to get this incredibly prestigious scholarship.

**FIRST THING: Started a Fake Non Profit organization with Fake product pictures and Fake testimonials.**

This was shocking to us. Frank had gone to poor settlements in rural areas and did legit photoshoots. He even made underprivileged people hold a bogus product (store bought) that he claimed to have built and pose for pictures! He had built a scam website for this which had no details whatsoever but just pictures, overambitious mission statements and lies about their achievements. He also got his family members to give testimonials about this organization. Recently he has taken down some photos with those bogus products and removed the testimonials by family members. But thankfully we have his entire old website saved. He has pulled this off to present himself as a humanitarian tech-guy to obtain the Scholarship.

We even think that he has taken the help of a local admission consultancy to pull off all this, because of their celebratory posts on social media. This consultancy is also involving other students in Frank’s organization who want to apply to universities in America and need some fake accomplishments.

**SECOND THING: Lied about getting a huge grant from one of the biggest foundations in the world.**

We know that this extremely huge and prestigious humanitarian grant was given to a senior professor in our University two years ago. We also know that the professor and his team have been working to implement their innovations locally for two years. Digging on this we found out that Frank was just unofficially involved with the team for a few days while drafting the grant proposal. In no way did he receive this grant nor did he work on anything related to it since the past two years. His name is not mentioned anywhere like the grant’s page on the foundation’s Website or our university website, because this is a complete lie.

There are a few more less serious fake accomplishments presented by Frank and we do have complete proof of it. But we will just stick to the above two for now.

Do keep in mind that Frank is an extremely charming guy, a great speaker who has been in the model united nations and other public speaking platforms. He has landed himself stellar research positions in the past even if it was because of his fraudulent marketing. Lastly he has good academic grades (not a big deal but still worth mentioning) and a number of research papers (poor quality but a large number of them). So we don’t think that he easily fooled Stanford U into giving him a scholarship. He WORKS HARD.

**One more shady thing:** He has not reported anyone about getting this scholarship, since there were no congratulatory posts ever by our university’s very active social media handles that congratulate people with the tiniest achievements. This achievement is massive and rare. We only got to know about this through our engineering geeks community in which someone got to know this from one of his close friends.

When we saw his recent fake accomplishments used to get the scholarship we approached a friendly professor from our university for guidance on what we should do. He said that we should not even think about it and just concentrate on our work and help better our society and god will take care of it somehow. He also suggested introspecting to see if we are angry out of jealousy. He read us some quotes from a religious philosophy book called the bhagwat geeta about focusing on our own business and how jealousy is bad for the mind. I believe in God and at that point I did think that I should let this go. I do not have the talent, accomplishments, nor the means to even get into Stanford U (let alone get a full scholarship), so why should I be bothered about Stanford U getting its next Elizabeth Holmes? And so I left it to God.

During these 3 months of quarantine I have had the chance of calmly talking about issues like frauds in technology and how local admission consultancies help students create fake versions of themselves etc. etc. with some interesting people including the leaders at the company where I work now who have studied and worked in America. Now upon introspecting these are the three key points I have that are meaningful to me as a believer in God who loves engineering and innovation and wants humanity to benefit from it.

**POINT ONE:** By giving Frank the quarter million dollar scholarship Stanford might have taken this money away from a brilliant but poor candidate from somewhere like Africa who could go on to do great things for humanity only if he had received the right opportunity. Spending resources on imposters affects the whole of human race. What if this huge amount of money was used to fund an organization that is developing the cure for AIDS?

**POINT TWO:** Most important point. Frank is negatively inspiring the upcoming engineers in my country. His success will surely encourage more youngsters to lead a fraudulent professional life and make them think that this is the best way to get success. Who doesn’t want success? I think that real meaningful success comes from truth and not lying and stepping on others. I love my country no matter how flawed it is and I see such wins by Frank as a threat to the much needed genuine intellectualism to benefit my society.

**POINT THREE:** What if this win encourages Frank to do more such things on a grander scale? What if he does become the next Elizabeth Holmes by starting a fraudulent company in my country and dupes people for billions of dollars? If he wrecks even one household in the future it would make me extremely sad for not speaking up when I saw this coming. God will not forgive me as well.

We know that these are some serious allegations against Frank. But we also want to know more about this scholarship program and get advices on what to do next so that we act with caution and not do something stupid. We are so happy to have found a reddit forum with the real Stanford U community.

**FIRST QUESTION:** is the Knight Hennessy Scholarship only given to potential leaders because it is a leadership program? Many great leaders lie without batting an eye. Does this mean that Knight Hennessey appreciates Frank’s leadership ability to lie and oversell himself? I am sure that they are not dumb and are quite diligent while selecting the scholars. How do they verify the details provided by a student? Is it based on trust? Will they reprimand a scholar for smartly faking accomplishments or is it a positive aspect for selection? (I am not asking this in a mocking way or trying to mock the genuine work of other amazing scholars at Stanford U. This is a genuine question. From obama to trump to hillary to bush, everyone's a great leader but boy they can lie)

**SECOND QUES:** what do you all think about this? Should we let this go and concentrate on our work and benefiting our society because that is more important? Is our outlook about this situation wrong and are we crossing the line by questioning the admission procedures in such a prestigious university? Please post your views down below because it will be extremely useful for us.

Thank you for reading till here. I congratulate you for all the achievements by Stanford U. I hope that god keeps blessing you all and you keep doing great things.

Yours truly,

It feels like the university has specifically said a lot of detailed info regarding undergrads but none about grad students and have kind of delegated it to departments to either figure out or convey, but it seems like individual departments don't want to say anything/want that responsibility. While the plan for undergrads obviously has a lot of limitations and isn't perfect, it at least communicates that university is actively evaluating the many different aspects of it. I'm just nervous things are going to be a shitshow that could have been avoided that could impact plans and push things back. Like the fact that undergrads will have spread out move in dates but there hasn't been discussion about implementing the same system for grad students?

I also would hate if at the start of the semester, due to rising cases or deaths in the area, it's decided that we're no longer advised/allowed to move in. Obviously if that ends up being the case, reality can't be changed and it is what it is, but it's frustrating because it seems like all the info coming out of all different parts of Stanford for grad students is just so optimistically vague? Like there's been no indication that domestic grad students should be prepared to not come to campus. I don't think Stanford means to deliberately send this message, but if they do, I rather they come out and say it explicitly so I can take it at face value and stop worrying as much. Because it's worse to have this sense of false assurance that programs will mostly start in person if there is a non-negligible chance that grad students won't be allowed to move in to campus. Also for people moving across the country, I have no idea when to even book a plane ticket for...

I realize this is mostly an anxiety-fueled rant and no one can predict that future, I just feel like there is a huge lack of clarity and I can't tell whether it's poor planning or Stanford deliberately trying to keep us in the dark."

I applied for special circumstances and got accepted. My question is whether it’s worth it to go this fall. On one hand, I get a change of scenery. On the other hand, I have no idea how restricted campus will be. Luckily, I have some close friends including 3 best friends staying home for their first semesters so I’d have people to spend time with if I stay home. I’m worried that if I go to campus, I won’t be able to make any friends due to the restrictions and end up feeling lonely. Also, it may be even harder to workout on campus if everything is closed than it’d be to workout home where I have at least I have some equipment and places to run and stuff. Is there any advantage at all to being on campus this fall?"

I'm worried that they won't see my email until Monday at the earlier when classes start so I won't have any other option but to either take a full course load or drop my introsem and enroll in PWR2.

Over the past couple of weeks I have had the thought that I wish I would be ok with being average. I know average is not always bad— I have for so long been trying to constantly one-up myself and others around me that now I wish I would be ok with going to a state school and getting an ‘normal’ job instead of going into an extremely competitive industry.  I know my mentality stems at least in part from elitism and imposter syndrome but I can’t seem to shake the thought that if I do less I will be a failure.

Frosh here. My parents just told me that they aren't sure we can afford Stanford for the rest of the year. We don't currently receive any financial aid, but their income dropped 30k (now sitting around 70k/year, but we own our house so that is why we don't get FA). They said that if there isn't another option then I can work and we will find a way for me to continue at Stanford (but I don't want to do this because I'd hate to put that burden on my parents). 

Their preference, however, would be for me to take a LoA for the rest of frosh year and take community college courses so that I can come in with sophomore standing (thus reducing how much they have to pay). Is this even possible?

Otherwise, are there any other options? Could I apply for FA this late? The thing I am also considering is dropping out and taking community college and then transferring to a UC, but so far I have fallen in love with Stanford's community and it would break my heart to have to leave it so soon."

To say that I am disappointed by the lack of solidarity from the Stanford community, would be an understatement.

I implore you to think about our equal moral worth as human beings, and more than that, about our shared claim to the Stanford experience. Have we not all studied in Green Library, snuck onto the roof at MemChu, ate a delicious hot dog at Caspar dining? Does this mean nothing to you?

The vitriol and anger currently circulating will engender harrowing consequences for our institution and for the free market system. If left unchecked, I fear this company’s IPO may be blocked, and they could even face delinquency. Need I remind you of how Stanford has [fallen so drastically short](https://imgur.com/gallery/Ps2PNZh) in recent global metrics? Think about how our collective action problem will reflect upon all of us and upon our endowment.

You may ask why we, the Stanford community, are obligated to act, to which I say in response: If not us, then who? If not now, then when?

I am also looking for some months-long scholarship/ work-and-travel programs that are fun and intellectually engaging (LMK if you know of any!).

I'm a little uneasy to take a gap year, admittedly. Given the current geopolitical climate, innumerable complications due to the Pandemic, and my corporate inexperience, I feel that I might have very limited options. Another thing is money— my parents, understandably, are not cool with paying for all of my expenses (like rent and food) especially if the job I'm working is lower-paying and I'm essentially losing money as well. I would prefer to go abroad, but the chances of doing so could dwindle in the coming months. 

So my questions are (assuming SU allows me to defer a year)—
1. To those who have taken GYs, did you do internships/scholarship programs? If so, where?
2. Where do you think I should continue my search for GY activities?
3. Is extracurricular enrichment at all the best route to go during a gap year?

He said that special circumstances can ask for more time... I’m just wondering what the best way to ask for more time is?!

JANUARY 9, 2021

Dear members of our Stanford community,
We are sending this weekend email to convey an unfortunate but important change in our undergraduate plans for the winter quarter.
After assessing the continuing surge in COVID-19 cases, the lengthening public health restrictions we are under, and how those restrictions likely will affect the on-campus undergraduate experience this quarter, we will not be able to have the frosh and sophomore classes return to campus for the winter quarter, as we had hoped.
Much has changed since early December, when we last updated you on our plans for the quarter. COVID-19 cases in California have skyrocketed. We are now at the worst point of the pandemic so far. Health officials said this week that before Thanksgiving, each day there were 4-5 positive COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population here in Santa Clara County. Recently, it has been approximately 50 cases per 100,000 population – a tenfold increase.
The surge has strained hospitals, leading to alarmingly low capacity in intensive-care units in the Bay Area and most of California and triggering state-mandated stay-at-home orders. Stanford’s hospital is now caring for its largest number of COVID-19 patients during the pandemic, including patients transferred from hospitals in other hard-hit parts of California. 
Amid these circumstances we have proceeded very cautiously as, in the past week, we have welcomed back graduate and professional students, as well as undergraduates with approved special circumstances. The health and safety of our community are, and must be, our top priority. Our expanded student testing program, along with our on-campus safety protocols, are aimed at supporting this critical objective of community health.
However, the worsening COVID-19 circumstances have now eroded our expectations about the experience we could deliver to undergraduates in the winter months. California and Santa Clara County have stringent public health restrictions tied to COVID-19 caseloads. When we carefully evaluated the situation in early December, we estimated that after a two-week arrival delay and a further two-week period of restricted activity, the likely relaxation of public health rules would start to allow more in-person activities, which would make it worthwhile for our frosh and sophomore classes to be on campus. 
Now, the modeling based on the most recent data available to us suggests it is unlikely that our county will be able to move out of California’s highest-risk COVID-19 “purple” tier until late in the winter quarter. That means many restrictions are likely to persist for most of the quarter. Without the ability to expand opportunities for in-person social and academic interaction to the extent we had anticipated, we do not believe we will be able to offer the kind of engaging on-campus student experience that would warrant bringing back the frosh and sophomore classes in their entirety.
We deeply regret having to change plans. We have concluded that doing so is in the best interest of students and our community, though we know many students will be disappointed. We wanted to share this information now, with winter quarter beginning Monday and many students in the frosh and sophomore classes planning to travel to campus two weeks from now.
What is next? Here are some key points:
•	Classes and student support services will continue to be fully available online, as they were in the fall. The academic continuity team will reach out to instructors who may be impacted by the change to make any adjustments needed.
 
•	All undergraduates with approved special circumstances, and undergraduate RAs, can continue to be in residence on campus.
 
•	Since some frosh and sophomores may not have applied to be in residence on the basis of a special circumstance, we will offer a new application period for those students who have not previously applied. Application information is available on a new frequently asked questions web page, referenced below. 
 
•	This Sunday’s online Winter Convocation for frosh will still occur at 4 p.m. Pacific time, but the Residence Welcomes and House Meetings later in the day will be canceled.
 
•	We are still planning, in our four-quarter academic year, to invite frosh and sophomores to be on campus for the summer quarter, assuming conditions allow. More information will be provided as soon as it is available.
 
•	A set of frequently asked questions about the above issues, as well as billing, financial aid and other questions that may be on your minds, has been posted for reference.
To the undergraduate and graduate students who are with us on campus, our commitment to you is undiminished. The university will continue to be in touch with you about the public health situation, and about what may be possible on campus as this quarter progresses. While we saw increased positive cases in our student testing programs this past week as students arrived on campus, we are confident that, with your partnership, we will be able to provide a safe and supportive environment on campus.
And to all students, wherever you are, the faculty and staff of Stanford University continue to be here to support your academic progress and personal wellbeing. We are still in very challenging days, but with the approach of COVID-19 vaccines for wider distribution, there is light at the end of the tunnel. Thank you for your courage and patience on this most unusual journey together.
Sincerely,
Marc Tessier-Lavigne

I can not use my hands properly and require a scribe to complete my schoolwork. At the moment, Stanford is not willing to provide me a scribe for my schoolwork as they believe it is a “personal preference” instead of a necessity. They are only willing to accommodate a scribe where there is limited use of the accommodation, such as tests and labs. This does not include homework and classwork where a scribe would actually be needed. I will not be able to attend Stanford if I do not get this scribe.

lqyend,https://www.reddit.com/r/stanford/comments/lqyend/a_small_rant/,a small rant,46,23,2021-02-23 16:39:06,"some TAs are super helpful and amazing, and some TAs really suck. I don't really want to make generalizations, but I've found that a lot of male TAs are a lot less empathetic and compassionate than female TAs. With that being said, I've had good male TAs before. Im just currently in a class that I've had negative experiences with the male TAs in the sense that they get frustrated if you don't immediately understand the concepts, they don't ever write down anything to show you how a procedure is done, and they really just don't empathize at all. I went through a bit of a snafu with the latest midterm for this class and the male TAs kind of just made me feel a lot worse about what happened, but when I emailed another TA, who happens to be a female, she wrote back and was really understanding and told me things would be okay. She happens to be the only TA whose OH I go to now since she really takes the time to explain concepts and go over problems. Shes amazing. 
I know it's kind of a dumb rant but it reminds me about how stupid I felt when I first got to Stanford. I would go to CS office hours (I forgot what they called that) and I was really struggling with a certain concept and I got assigned to a dude who was treating me like I was so stupid for not understanding after he explained it to me twice. I later got a female TA who helped draw the concept out and was really patient and kind with me. There was another time I went to an OH for another stem class and the TA (a guy) started also getting frustrated with me when I couldn't visualize what he was talking about. I feel like I'm a person who needs to visually see concepts and when people describe things to me I don't really know what they're talking about. I also just really hated the way those TAs made me feel about not immediately understanding what they're talking about and making me feel stupid for even asking... 
I'd like to hear you all's experiences with TAs. I'm once again stating that I'm not really trying to make generalizations. I know there are good male TAs, I just happen to have way more positive experiences with female TAs than male ones."

Additionally, if anybody knows, how is Stanford’s film? I’ve been looking at the classes offered but usc is much stronger in film of course. But I believe that finding an internship through stanford at a production company (Disney, Lucasfilms, etc have jobs in the Bay Area) may be more valuable than a film minor at usc.

In the CSS profile section ""Student Expected Income and Benefits"" we are asked to provide our expected earnings for the 2020-2021 academic year, as well as our expected taxed income and total untaxed income. Should I include any financial aid that I expect to receive for housing and food as part of my expected taxed income or untaxed income? (I ask because I paid state and federal taxes on the financial aid I received this year, but I know some consider it untaxed). Or do these fields only pertain to any income I may receive from internships and TA jobs, for example, and not financial aid? 

In the ""Student Resources"" Section we are also asked to include our expected earnings from ""employers, (i.e. tuition benefits), including their parent's employers."" Should I include financial aid as ""tuition benefits"" or is this something different?

I'm a current student. In the past, some courses had their course materials open to *everyone* and then eventually only opened up course materials to current students via Axess. Doing this is fine, I understand the intention in blocking out materials only to paying students, it's fine to do and I know there's things like [see](https://see.stanford.edu/) that already exist for non-students who want access to Stanford materials without getting enrolled here.

But for current students, departments block out courses that I need for review at times or new materials I want to just casually check out if i'm shopping a course. Needed to review some graph theory from 103, *entire fucking course* blocked only to enrolled students. Wanted to review some small calc material from Math 51 and I can't even access a course webpage anymore. So many of these introductory courses had open course materials and now it's just all blocked, this is obviously the case for advanced coursework as well.

Is this just Covid shit and professors only want to block out materials only for enrolled students? Is the school trying to just move everything to Canvas and cash out course materials only to the students willing to cash out thousands for summer sessions or online formats? At least having introductory courses more accessible would be helpful to have for current enrolled students, I don't need these courses for review often but it would be nice to have to refer to or if I'm shopping courses and want to get a general feel for homeworks, lecture material, etc."

I've narrowed it down to Computer Science and Mathematics (Degree 1) and Politics, Philosophy and Economics (Degree 2). Whilst degree 2 has a much more enticing curriculum and would, for me, be a much more personally enriching program (I think I'd enjoy it more), I know I wouldnt be working in any career related to it in the future. On the other hand, degree 1 has career prospects much more in line in what I want to do (quant, machine learning, or start-ups), but I feel there are drawbacks - mainly, I feel it'd be a less worthwhile 4 years. For all intents and purposes, degree 1 is more employable, but i thought I'd search for a degree that combines elements of both options while focusing heavily on computer science. I feel like... I might end up hating coding and thus want kind of a safety net... to be able to branch out in non conventional tech roles. In this search, I came across Symbiolic Systems, and I think it is everything I want in my future major - it allows me to learn PPE whilst being able to work in a CS and Math field. However, as you can guess, the issue is that.... this major is specific to stanford, a school I am quite unlikely to get into.

So, I have 2 questions. Firstly, to any Symbiolic System majors, does it seem like a good fit for what I want? I guess my main worry is that I wont be seen as a true CS major. Secondly, what is the non-stanford equivalent to this major? As in, which common major in most unis is most like it?

We’re a team of CS students that have gone through the struggle of finding an internship, from trying to find up-to-date salaries on cluttered job sites, to searching through months of Discord or Reddit posts to learn more about the role.

We built intabs to alleviate some of these pains – you can think of this site as an all-in-one “Glassdoor for interns”, with curated reviews, salaries, and timelines from real students and just for interns.

Here are some of the features you’ll be able to use right now:

* Search for company salaries by graduation date and season
* Share reviews of the best (and especially the worst) places to work anonymously
* Prepare for your upcoming interviews by viewing previously asked questions
* Discover when people are getting online assessments, interviews, or offers
* Keep track of the status of your applications with built-in process tracking

We’re working hard to keep our site updated, and we currently have over 400 salaries, 100 job postings, and 300 reviews from current students and past megathreads. If you have any salaries or reviews you’d like to share, we would really appreciate it if you add them as well to help grow the community.

Check out intabs [here](http://intabs.io/)! To anyone looking for an internship in the future we hope that you find this helpful – we're always trying to improve our site, so we would love to hear your thoughts and feedback below.

Here is the basic gist of my circumstances:

* I will not be flying home (driving), and therefore have no obligation (and will not be affected financially either way) to set any plans in stone right now
* A vast majority of my courses will be music courses, and I will need continual access to very loud brass instruments multiple times a day, every day. Normally, I would be able to use practice rooms, but given these new circumstances that would mean I would have to move electronics *and* heavy instruments constantly, and daily, to join Zoom meetings. If the practice rooms were full, I would be out of luck. I could of course do these from my dorm room, but I can only imagine how disruptive this would be to my dorm mates, let alone my roommate. At home, however, I have a dedicated room only for music and quiet studying.
* While I fully understand the intention for us to return on time to minimize disruption in the case of a positive test, I am fully vaccinated, will be boosted, and have had the virus before. I also live in a very low-rate-of-positivity area and intend to isolate before returning to campus.

As noted, these are my circumstances, and some points are more unique to me than others. In speaking with my peers, a vast majority are intending to return on time.
