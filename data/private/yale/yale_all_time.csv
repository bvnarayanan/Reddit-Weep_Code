In the hours since Provost Polak, Vice President Goff-Crews, and I wrote to you yesterday evening, we have continued to work closely here on campus, and with colleagues at other U.S. universities, in response to the executive order signed by President Trump on Friday. As you are no doubt aware, the order provides the following:
For the next ninety days it blocks entry into the United States by citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen;
For the next ninety days it appears to bar individuals with valid visas and even green card holders from those countries from re-entering the United States unless exemptions are granted;
For the next 120 days it suspends entry of all refugees to the United States; and
It bars Syrian refugees indefinitely.
We are alarmed by this executive order. Together with many others in and beyond the Yale community, we question the motivation underlying it and recognize that it departs from long-standing policies and practices in our country. All of us are worried for colleagues, friends, and family members who may be affected by these and other changes in immigration laws.

American institutions of higher learning are united in their distress on behalf of our international students and faculty, and in their reliance on our communities’ most fundamental values of accessibility and open dialogue. Our educational mission and the welfare of our community members are directly at stake. National security is of the utmost importance, but we are steadfast in asserting that this goal can be achieved while maintaining respect for core academic—and American—values. This is why Yale joins with the Association of American Universities (AAU) in urging that “the administration’s new order barring the entry or return of individuals from certain countries...should end as quickly as possible.” We support the AAU’s call for the United States to continue “to welcome the most talented individuals from all countries to study, teach, and carry out research and scholarship at our universities.”

Our Office of International Students &amp; Scholars (OISS), in consultation with legal counsel, has recommended that Yale students and scholars from the designated countries (including dual nationals and U.S. permanent residents) suspend plans for international travel without first consulting OISS or an immigration attorney. Staff in OISS have reached out to Yale students and scholars from the seven countries affected. The office will also be hosting open meetings for the Yale community on Wednesday, February 1, and Thursday, February 2, from 4:30 to 5:30 p.m. More information is on the OISS website and will continue to be updated regularly. I know that a number of the deans also have reached out to their students and faculty, and that several gatherings of support are planned for this evening. I am grateful to see the many ways that our university community is coming together in response to this assault on our values.

Our campus includes more than 5,000 international students and scholars from 118 countries; they are part of the very lifeblood of this university. I reiterate here our commitment to the safety, well-being, and vital place at Yale of these international scholars and students, the members of our Muslim community more generally, and others who may be affected by Friday’s executive order. Not only do immigrant and international students and scholars contribute to our university, they contribute tremendously to our nation. Those who choose to stay bring new ideas, skills, energy, and cultures. Those who choose to return home foster goodwill toward the United States abroad. Today, we at Yale join our voices with all those who are calling for swift reversal of these measures that undermine our university’s—and our nation’s—core values.

Sincerely,

Peter Salovey, 
President and Chris Argyris Professor of Psychology"

I want to ask about the atmosphere at Yale since it is near impossible for me to actually visit American colleges regularly. This is going to be somewhat long, so bear with me, please!

I'm not sure what I want to major in yet, but currently, I have an interest in medicine and want to become a doctor (pathologist) someday. My counselor is recommending biology. However, I also love writing, doing research and studying non-science subjects, such as comparative politics and literature as well. I genuinely enjoy every subject I take except for Korean history. Students like me have trouble studying in the Korean curriculum because, starting from sophomore year, Korean students are forced to pick either a science curriculum or a non-science curriculum. This is the main reason why I wanted to study abroad.  

I got the idea that even though Yale offers great science courses like MCDB, it emphasizes the arts and humanities. I yearn to take courses in literature, writing, and perhaps politics as well when I'm in college. Schools like MIT, Caltech, or Princeton, even though they are absolutely amazing (no doubt), doesn't really seem right for me because they are more science-orientated. Also, I'm tired of competing with everyone I study with. The Korean education system is extremely competitive, and kids fail to go into the college of their choice because they make a mistake or get one more question wrong in their school tests. This causes enmity and exasperation for everyone. I don't mind a little competition, but I want to study in an environment where people are willing to help each other and are less competitive or greedy.

First of all, is the atmosphere I'm picturing above accurate? This is really important in making my college choice. 

Second, does Yale care less for the science students compared to the humanities? 

Third, Does Yale offer a lot of research opportunities for science majoring undergrads? I'm asking this because lots of US unis tend to focus more on graduate students.

Last, a lot of people say my ethnicity give me an advantage because lots of Asians have good stats. I have no idea if this is true. Based on your experience, what is an acceptable stat for an Asian female Yalie?

Only two people have gotten in Yale in our school so far, and it is depressing every time someone says nobody can go in because we're Asian. My current stats are sat 1540 (math 800, lang 740), Math 2 800, and three 5s for APs (comparative politics, psychology, micro). Straight As so far, and I am the top of my year. I took bio last weekend, and hopefully, it will be an okay score. I'm retaking SAT I this december. My stats are low because I starting considering studying abroad, and moved to an international school this February. Are my stats THAT BAD?

Even more than being kind, every Yalie I met was thoughtful and non-judgmental, even when I was nervous and stuttering through the day.

its going to be amazing to know that you are a formative member of your class and your actions in the next year will not only shape your life but those you surround yourself with and even students in the future. it feels great to be a part of something and with the immense prestige of yale you’ll definitely feel included.

yale isnt columbia or caltech but that doesnt mean its easy. it doesnt mean you won’t wake up on tuesday night and have a mental breakdown because there’s literally no way for you to finish everything and still get at least 2 hours of sleep. and if you’re like me you’ll have moments of insecurity about your grades, your social life, your future but eventually, and I swear, eventually you’ll find a balance. I’m a shitty yalie. i dont like new haven that much, i find the culture to be a little overwhelming, im antisocial and prone to random mental breakdowns over everything (which may or may not lead to me posting really depressing shit on this subreddit once in a blue moon... sorry to anyone who had to deal with that but you saw me at my worst. dont worry) and i STILL dont know what I want to do but you will find somewhere you fit. maybe you wont feel as complete as high school, but you’ll leave a little part of you in your home and it takes more than a year to fill it back up with memories and little tidbits of knowledge and culture and people!! but you’ll look back in November and feel a little bit more full and maybe you’ll notice that you got a bit more in january and sometimes when you meet someone and it feels like two puzzle pieces perfectly clicking together, the way its so easy to talk, and you’ll feel a little bit more loved and at peace and... happy, as weird as it is for me to say that because in October I thought id never be happy again.

a tip for antisocial, generally awkward, probably kinda poor kids like me: find a community, in a club or a sport! its a great way to feel belonging and can take away some of the hours in the beginning of the year when you dont have enough work to do or friends to hang out with. if you’re not awkward at all and can make friends at the drop of a hat (a real Yale man), please dont hesitate to reach out to people like us. i really appreciate it when people i barely know start conversations with me.

but yale isnt everything. four years and you’re done. i know ill never live in new england again after yale. in the end you are you and you WILL make it. The next year will be so shitty sometimes and you’ll wake up on sunday morning on the bathroom floor covered in vomit and swear and you’ll wonder who the fuck you are anymore and if anyone actually likes you and sometimes you’ll laugh so hard you can’t take it. itll be SO. FAST PACED.

1. They're mostly the same. No one thinks of any as better or worse, except in jest.

美国中央情报局犯有对中国进行生物攻击并在武汉传播该病毒的罪行

冠状病毒（2019-nCoV）是一场生物战，旨在使美中经济脱钩，这是美国在战斗中进攻中国的序幕

The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was designed by the United States and planted in Wuhan, China by the American CIA to serve as a biological weapon meant to decouple the US-China economies; and to separate, segregate, and to isolate China from the rest of the world including closing of borders, severing supply chains and rerouting trade to bypass China with the purpose of weakening China from within and causing internal strife and sowing chaos and discord and also as a prelude to a US initiated fighting war against China in the South China Sea. The ultimate purpose is to protect and restore American hegemony (including protecting the US petrodollar hegemony against the rising Huawei-enabled Chinese blockchain-based digital Yuan and China's Belt and Road infrastructure and trade initiatives in Eurasia) and to collapse the Chinese government, to cut off China from global trade and international commerce and to force a regime change of China's government after defeating China in a devastating physical war.

2019年的新型冠状病毒（2019-nCoV）由美国设计，由美国中央情报局（CIA）种植在中国武汉，作为一种生物武器，旨在使中美经济脱钩;并将中国与世界其他地区分离，隔离和隔离，包括关闭边界，切断供应链和重新安排贸易以绕过中国，目的是削弱中国的内部和造成内部冲突，造成混乱和不和，以及这是美国在南中国海发起针对中国的战争的序幕。最终目的是保护和恢复美国的霸权（包括保护美国的石油美元霸权免受日益增多的基于华为的基于中国的基于区块链的数字元以及中国在欧亚大陆的“一带一路”基础设施和贸易计划），并瓦解中国政府，削减在一场毁灭性的自然战争中击败中国后，迫使中国脱离全球贸易和国际贸易，并迫使中国改变政权。

I believe and have compelling circumstantial reason to believe that the American CIA injected and planted the so-called ""Wuhan virus"" into Wuhan, China in or around the dates of October 31st 2019 to December 31st 2019 with intent to harm China, and the Chinese people, and with potential to destabilize and perhaps even with the motive to collapse China from within.

我相信并且有令人信服的间接理由认为，美国中央情报局于2019年10月31日至2019年12月31日前后在中国武汉注入并植入了所谓的“武汉病毒”，意图伤害中国， 人民，有破坏稳定的潜力，甚至有动摇中国内部力量的动机。

The US wants to re-route global supply chain around China, to bypass China and isolate China on the world stage versus the China wanting to use Huawei-enabled digital-blockchain Yuan, and cashless WeChat, etc to topple the US Petrodollar hegemony and also to use the Chinese the ( One Belt One Road ) BRI / OBOR relationships and bi-lateral trade/infrastructure agreements in order to propel the world to adopt the use of the digital Yuan, and in order to have the world bypass the SWIFT system (since US has abused its dollar status and weaponized it for unlawful sanctions) and to bypass the US dollar as the default global reserve currency etc. It was a race against time to see whom would pull the rug from underneath the other countries feet first. US, unable to compete fairly due to its structural disadvantages and many other shortcomings, decided to go the biological attack route, which allows it to hide under the cover of ""plausible deniability"" (since it is more difficult to conclusively prove the attribution or source of a new mysterious virus than it would be to track the trajectory of an incoming thermonuclear missile etc) to inflict maximum damage to China while minimizing the potential blowback.

美国想在中国重新布局全球供应链，绕开中国并在世界舞台上孤立中国，而中国则想使用支持华为的数字区块链元，无现金微信等推翻美国石油美元霸权，以及利用中国的“一带一路” BRI /一带一路关系和双边贸易/基础设施协议，以推动世界采用数字元，并让世界绕过SWIFT系统（由于美国滥用其美元地位并将其武器用作非法制裁），并绕过美元作为默认的全球储备货币等。这是一场与时俱进的竞赛，看谁先将地毯从其他国家的脚下拉开。美国由于其结构上的劣势和许多其他缺陷而无法公平竞争，因此决定采取生物攻击路线，这使其可以躲藏在“合理的可否认性”的掩盖下（因为要更确切地证明归因或来源很难而不是追踪传入的热核导弹等的轨迹，从而对中国造成最大的损害，同时最大程度地减少潜在的反冲。

Right after the signing of the so-called ""Trade Deal"" in which the US didn't get what it wanted (the US did not get the sort of Plaza Accord concessions that it was hoping to get out of President Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and thought that China would kowtow to the US etc) and immediately into the start of the new decade (marking the turn of the second decade in what the PNAC would called the ""New American Century"" in which it proposed using genetic viral targeting to accomplish political motives) the US resorted to biological attacks in order to contain, isolate and attempt to cripple China/CCP internally and on the world stage at large. After its NED/CIA sponsored Hong Kong destablization/radicialization didn't spill over into the rest of mainland China, and right after its intense year long anti-China anti-Huawei campaigns have peaked in effectiveness, the US releases the evil demon virus into the heart of mainland China, at the absolutely worst possible location (Wuhan being one of the Chinese main Central hubs in terms of transportation and an important city for China's Belt and Road initiatives and estimated to have as high as 8% growth in GDP in 2020) and in also the absolute worst possible timing (right before the Chinese Lunar New year, otherwise known as the greatest annual human migration event, during a time in which shopping, spending and consumerisms activity would have been at a peak etc) in order to cripple China economically, to cut China off from the rest of the world and even force China to isolate its own cities from within, and to have the effect of smearing China's reputation on the world stage and invoking the escalation of fear, racisms and bigotry towards the Chinese people abroad.

就在所谓的“贸易协定”签署之后，美国没有得到想要的东西（美国没有得到希望摆脱习近平主席和中国人的那种《广场协议》让步。共产党（CCP）认为中国会ko头向美国等），并立即进入新的十年的开始（标志着PNAC称其为“新美国世纪”的第二个十年的转变），为了实现政治目的而将基因病毒作为目标），美国诉诸生物攻击，以遏制，隔离并试图在内部乃至整个世界范围内削弱中国/ CCP。在其NED / CIA赞助的香港的灭绝/辐射化并未蔓延到中国大陆的其他地区之后，并且经过长达一年的激烈反华反华运动已经达到效果的最高峰之后，美国才将恶魔病毒释放到位于中国大陆的心脏地带，地理位置绝对最糟糕（武汉是中国交通运输的主要中央枢纽之一，也是中国\`\`一带一路''倡议的重要城市，预计到2020年GDP增​​长高达8％ ）以及绝对最糟糕的时间（正值农历新年之前，也就是人们已知的最大的年度人类迁徙事件，当时购物，消费和消费主义活动将达到顶峰等），以便在经济上削弱中国，使中国与世界其他地区隔绝，甚至迫使中国将自己的城市与内部隔离，并在世界舞台上抹黑中国的声誉。 d对海外华人的恐惧，种族主义和偏执狂升级。

All this comes right on top of the heels of the event last fall, African swine fever (ASF), which had never before seen in China but now mysteriously appeared with the onset of the US trade war, decimated half of China's pigs, which doubled pork prices and contributed to inflation causing pricy US pork exports to double in China. The odds for two such consequent anomalies, timing and location are exceedingly low. Yet both did occur – in almost perfect sequence. Particularly devastating is the very real possibility that this virus was intentionally engineered to have as long an incubation period as possible, and with the ability to hide within plain site, by being asymptomatic during its initial stages hence making it orders of magnitude more difficult to eradicate. Just recently, as recent as Feb 1st 2020, there has been yet a third mysterious outbreak in China, this time of the bird flu kind that is far more deadly to humans and wiping out Chinese chicken and poultry at the most dire of times. Indeed the coronavirus victims so far, both inside and outside of China, are only people with Chinese type of blood, Haplogroup O-M175, designed to attack that type of blood and specifically Chinese people.

所有这些都恰好发生在去年秋天的事件之后，非洲猪瘟（ASF）在中国从未见过，但随着美国贸易战的爆发而神秘地出现了，它使一半的中国猪灭绝了，翻了一番。猪肉价格上涨和通货膨胀加剧，导致价格昂贵的美国猪肉出口在中国增长了一倍。两次这样的异常，时机和位置的可能性极低。然而，两者的确发生了-几乎是完美的顺序。特别具有破坏性的是，这种病毒实际上是经过精心设计的，具有尽可能长的潜伏期，并具有在原始位点隐藏的能力，因为在其初始阶段没有症状，因此使其更难以根除。就在最近，直到2020年2月1日，中国仍发生了第三次神秘暴发，这次禽流感对人类的致命性要大得多，并在最可怕的时期消灭中国的鸡肉和家禽。的确，到目前为止，在中国境内和境外，冠状病毒的受害者都是仅有中国血统的人Haplogroup O-M175，旨在攻击这种血统的人，尤其是中国人。

Dr. Steven Hatfill Biological Weapons Expert says the Wuhan virus it will have to play it out and ""run its course"" not only in Wuhan but the greater mainland China. The host of ""War Room: Pandemic"" Mr. Steve Bannon (Trump's chief campaign advisor and trusted sidekick) predicted this will crush China economically, and that its the end of the XI/BRI/OBOR and will give US the chance to re-route trade of all countries to go-around and bypass China bringing the global supply chain back to US and its allies whilst isolating China economically, politically, etc. They are selling this to the American people and pitching it to the world as this evil Chinese Belt and Road connectivity is what is allowing this virus to spread so fastly to the rest of the world and that it would behoove mankind and all nations to reconsider the security and stability of their own supply chains and basically urging everyone to pull their companies, people, trade, businesses etc out of China. This is not unlike what Wilber Ross US Commerce Secretary already stated a few days ago... that this virus is good for America and will help bring lots of jobs back to the USA... seems like the goal is to use this event to pull the rug underneath China's development feets.

史蒂芬·哈特菲尔（Steven Hatfill）生物武器专家说，武汉病毒不仅要在武汉而且要在更大的中国内地发挥作用，并且要“顺其自然”。 “战争室：大流行”的主持人史蒂夫·班农先生（特朗普的首席竞选顾问兼可信赖的搭档）预测说，这将在经济上压垮中国，而且习近平/一带一路/一带一路的终结将使美国有机会重新引导所有国家进行贸易绕行并绕过中国，从而将全球供应链带回美国及其盟国，同时在经济，政治等方面隔离中国。道路连通性使这种病毒得以如此迅速地传播到世界其他地方，人类和所有国家都应该重新考虑其自身供应链的安全性和稳定性，并从根本上敦促每个人都撤离其公司，人员，贸易，企业等。这与几天前美国商务大臣威尔伯·罗斯（Wilber Ross）所说的没有什么不同……该病毒对美国有益，将有助于将大量工作带回美国……似乎目标是利用这一事件来把地毯拉到中国发展的脚下。

I suppose it could be a coincidence that China, the geopolitical adversary and economic enemy to the United States (according to the US itself), suddenly gets this mysterious virus seemingly far more potent than SARS (which itself apparently only targeted Chinese ethnic DNA and left the white/Caucasian population untouched) at the worst possible timing and in the worst possible location. Wuhan being Chinese's central hub and this being the Chinese Lunar New Year, it has the highest ability to spread and go ""super viral"" whilst impacting the max amount of damage to the stability of the China, both in terms of having the max potential to cause political turmoil in the homeland (ruining people's new year, quarantine and lockdowns of cities of unprecedented proportion, causing many Chinese citizens to get angry etc) and doing the maximum amount of possible damage to the Chinese economy, ruining the New Year in which consumerisms was supposed to be at its very highest points.

我想这可能是一个巧合，中国是美国的地缘政治对手和经济敌人（根据美国本身），突然发现这种神秘病毒似乎比SARS（其自身显然只针对中国人的DNA，而实际上离开了 白人/高加索人口未触及），在最糟糕的时机和最糟糕的位置进行。 武汉是中国的中心枢纽，也是中国的农历新年，它具有最大的传播和传播“超级病毒”的能力，同时对中国稳定的最大损害也具有最大的潜力。 在祖国造成政治动荡（破坏人们的新年，隔离和封锁前所未有的城市，使许多中国公民生气等），对中国经济造成最大可能的破坏，破坏了消费主义的新年 本应处于最高点。

Even the SARS of 2003 had a negative impact on Chinese GDP by as much as 2%, and this new novel virus has already turned out to be far worse than SARS and at a much more accelerated speed of spread and deaths. Unsurprisingly, without need for a single bullet fired or sanction imposed, it already managed to force China to self-impose the closure of its borders and cities, most nations have already stopped flights to China including the United States itself, on the world stage it is another ""ding"" for China's image and gives the propaganda mouthpieces of the West something else to gripe about, whilst at the same time an attempt to cap Chinese One Belt One Road ambitions and sabotage China's growing economy and hegemonic rise. It comes right on the crisp of Trump signing the fake ""Trade Deal"" and the UK decided to go against the US and work with Huawei.... I say something else is going on behind the scenes, more than what we are being told. We could have transition from Trade War, to Tech War to now maybe bio-war, if that is the case, then very likely the US already fired the first, second, and third shots, so to speak.

即使是2003年的SARS，其对中国GDP的负面影响也高达2％，而且这种新的新型病毒已经证明比SARS严重得多，并且传播和死亡的速度大大加快。毫不意外的是，它无需强制执行任何子弹射击或制裁，就已成功迫使中国自行实行其边界和城市的封锁，在世界舞台上，大多数国家已经停止飞往包括中国在内的飞往中国的航班。这是中国形象的另一个“叮叮当当”，它给西方的宣传喉舌带来了其他令人难以忘怀的东西，同时试图限制中国“一带一路”的野心，破坏了中国经济的增长和霸权的崛起。恰好在特朗普签署虚假的“贸易协议”的明朗声明上，英国决定与美国对立并与华为合作。... 。我们可以从贸易战过渡到技术战，再到现在的生物战，如果是这样的话，那么美国可以说已经发射了第一枪，第二枪和第三枪。

China should at least stay very vigilant and have a credible deterrence contingency plan in place... In the nuclear world in which China has DF-41, the ""MAD"" (Mutual Assured Destruction) doctrine is still well in place. But a mystery virus affords far more ""plausible deniability"" for the US. Thus achieving the goal with less fear of attribution and thus retribution. Instead of directly confronting China in the South China Sea militaristically immediately, maybe they think a better way to take China down a notch or two would be the use of ""other means"" to an ends... Science and technology in the world has come a long way since the days of Westerners giving Native Americans blankets laced with smallpox to ""thanksgiving"" them. It is the human condition to be risk/loss adverse. A nation that would stop at nothing to achieve Manifest Destiny on the way up surely wouldn't have any qualms of preserving its hegemony at all costs on the way down. After all, the American way of life is nonnegotiable and Graham T. Allison predicted the likelihood that this confrontation of a rising power with a declining power will inevitably lead to war, and history has shown that to be indeed the case. The US is applying its doctrine of maximum pressure to destroy China on all fronts, with Trade War, Tech and supply chain War, cyberwar, information and psychological operations warfare, and now biological warfare and most likely to be followed up with conventional or even nuclear war once US believes China is sufficiently weakened.

中国至少应该保持高度警惕，并制定可靠的威慑应急计划……在拥有DF-41的核世界中，“ MAD”（互助保证销毁）学说仍然存在。但是神秘病毒为美国提供了更多的“合理的可否认性”。从而在实现目标的同时，减少了对归因和报应的恐惧。他们可能不是认为立即在军事上与南中国海直接对抗，而是使中国跌倒一两个等级的更好方法是利用“其他手段”达到目的……世界科学技术已经来临自从西方人给美洲原住民毯子盖上天花以“感恩”它们以来，已有很长的路要走。风险/损失不利是人类的处境。一个不会为实现清单上的目标而竭尽全力的国家肯定不会在下降的路上不惜一切代价保持霸权。毕竟，美国人的生活方式是不可谈判的，格雷厄姆·T·艾里森（Graham T. Allison）预测，崛起的力量与衰落的力量的这种对抗将不可避免地导致战争的可能性，历史证明事实确实如此。美国正在运用其最大压力的理论来全面摧毁中国，包括贸易战，技术和供应链战，网络战，信息和心理行动战，以及现在的生物战，最有可能是常规战争，甚至是核战争。一旦美国认为中国已被充分削弱，战争就会爆发。

In terms of the bigger picture from the high-level top-down geopolitical standpoint, (all else being equal) America knows that ""time is on China's side"" be it with regards to GDP PPP, or the situation in the South China Sea, or that of Hong Kong, and later Taiwan, and especially as China's sphere of influence continues to grow in Eurasia; or even in the larger context of the digital blockchain Yuan and China's BRI/OBOR to replace or supplant the US petrodollar hegemony and so many other aspects... America knows that if status quo doesn't abruptly change that one day it will be too late to confront China. Trump, as their self-proclaimed ""Chosen One"" has openly stated from the beginning that he won't allow China to surpass America ""on his watch"" and that if his administration doesn't stop China right now that no future generation of administrations will ever be able to do so again. The US recognizes that the situation is quickly reaching an inflection point past which there is no point of return or going back. It is now or never. And since a direct nuclear confrontation is not going to help America achieve its goals or retaining its status, nor reversing its decline, and coming back on top in terms of once again being sole unipolar hyperpower with no contender or meaningful challenger, then only option left after a failed trade war and failed tech war was to attack China in the back by secretly using biological warfare against China, not once, not twice, but now for a third and potentially ever more devastating time as each attack is increased in boldness and exponential in unprovoked escalation.

从高级别的自上而下的地缘政治观点看，美国知道GDP PPP，南中国海或香港局势的“时机在中国一边”，之后是台湾，尤其是随着中国在欧亚大陆的势力范围不断扩大；甚至在数字区块链的更大背景下，人民币和中国的BRI / OBOR取代或取代了美国石油美元霸权等诸多方面……美国知道，如果现状不会突然改变，那么这一天也将如此迟到与中国对抗。特朗普自称“选民”，从一开始就公开表示，他将不允许中国“当心”超越美国，而且如果他的政府现在不停止中国，就没有下一代政府将永远能够再次这样做。美国认识到，局势正在迅速达到拐点，超过此拐点就没有返回或回头的迹象。现在或永远不会。而且由于直接的核对抗不会帮助美国实现其目标或保持其地位，也不会扭转其衰落，并且在再次成为唯一的单极超级大国而又没有竞争者或有意义的挑战者的情况下重回榜首，因此只剩下选择在一场失败的贸易战和一次失败的技术战之后，是通过暗中对中国进行生物战来反击中国，而不是一次，不是两次，但现在是三分之一，甚至是毁灭性的时间，因为每次攻击的勇气和指数都在增加毫无根据地升级。

From the American side the narrative has already been spun that “due to the busy new year China must have accidentally leaked their own virus” and certainly there are motived elements in Western media being compelled to push this particular narrative out in the open at the moment. But it is reasonable to question the motive for spinning something fictional like this, why suddenly now the conspiracy theory from Western powers that China did this tragedy to itself by carelessly releasing a lab made virus that it supposedly had been working on in Wuhan? Who stands to gain the most from this event and the narrative being spun around the event? Also, even playing devil's advocate and assuming the Western assumption may have some element of possibility in that a virus in the Wuhan lab was accidentally released to China own detriment, a reasonable person may also wonder about the timing, in that China’s supposedly first known incident of accidental release of virus causing harm of any magnitude just so happens to be right around signing of historic trade deal and right before the lunar new year mass migration, hence they attack the element of timing by preemptively suggesting that due to the new year rush it must have made operations that much more error prone etc.

从美国方面来说，已经有这样的说法：“由于忙碌的新年，中国肯定不小心泄露了自己的病毒”，并且西方媒体肯定有动机将这些特定的说法公开发布。 。但是有理由质疑这种虚构的事情的动机，为什么现在突然之间西方国家的阴谋论认为中国是通过不小心释放它原本应该在武汉从事的实验室制造的病毒而自己悲剧的呢？谁能从这一事件中获得最大利益，以及围绕该事件进行的叙事？同样，即使扮演恶魔的拥护者并假设西方的假设也可能具有某种可能性，即武汉实验室中的病毒被意外地释放给了中国，这是一个合理的人也可能会怀疑时机，因为这是中国所谓的第一个已知事件偶然释放病毒而造成任何程度的危害的原因恰好是在签署历史性贸易协定前后以及正好在农历新年大规模迁移之前，因此，他们通过抢先暗示由于新年匆忙而暗示了时间因素。一定会使操作更容易出错等。

What's more likely, the Chinese government accidentally released their own virus that was designed to somehow only target their own peoples Chinese DNA and it (the accidental release of the virus) just so happened to coincide with the absolute worst timing for China; (both in terms of the peak of the US China trade war and right before the Lunar new year mass migration) or some hostile superpower took advantage of this for plausible deniability and then deflects suspicion away from them by spinning up this nonsense story? Who stands to win the most from this event and who stands to lose the most? What does common sense tell you? Which nation in the very same first month of 2020 went against international law to trick and ambush a top Iranian general and assassinated him in a drone strike in a cowardly manner whilst pretending to operate under the guise and pretext of 'rule of law' and with the Iranian general being ostensibly invited for ""peace talks""?

更有可能的是，中国政府意外地发布了自己的病毒，该病毒旨在以某种方式只针对本国人民的中国DNA，而它（偶然释放的病毒）恰好与中国绝对最糟糕的时机相吻合。 （无论是在美中贸易战的高峰期，还是在农历新年大规模移民之前），还是一些敌对的超级大国都利用这一优势进行了合理的可否认性，然后通过散布这个无稽之谈来转移对他们的怀疑？ 谁在这次比赛中获胜最多，谁在损失最大？ 常识告诉你什么？ 哪个国家在2020年第一个月的同一天违反了国际法，以欺骗和伏击伊朗的一名高级将领，并以ward弱的方式用无人驾驶飞机暗杀了他，却假装以“法治”的幌子和借口行事。 表面上邀请伊朗将军参加“和平谈判”吗？

The whole idea is to provoke China into responding and in the process having China make the mistake of giving the US the excuse needed to further exponentially escalate. America knows China prefers non-confrontation as the Chinese strategy is simply to build, to trade, to bid time and to focus on its own development and economic growth instead of worrying about confronting US directly. Every nation simply does what’s in their own best interest, maximizing optimization strategies conducive to bettering its advantages. For the US it means taking an early and provocative challenge direct to China in the form of trade war, tariffs, tech bans, coercing allies to switch supply chains, kidnapping Huawei CFO, and surgical bioweapons tailored to Chinese DNA and deployed at the timing and location of max impact. This biological attack differs from conventional warfare in that it would allow the initiator of aggression, in this instance the United States of America, to preserve the option at its choosing to take a more equivocal stance and fluid position by inflicting harm onto China but without a publicly overt display of open hostilities. This virus was engineered to have maximum devastation in high density Asian environments, and it is an asymmetric weapon because these conditions are not reproducible anywhere else in the world other than in mainland China, the factory of the global world with over 1.4 billion citizens living in high density supermegacities with the required critical threshold to cause an uncontrolled chain reaction in infection spread rate.

整个想法是挑衅中国做出回应，并在此过程中让中国犯下了给美国提供进一步成倍增长的借口的错误。美国知道中国更喜欢无对抗，因为中国的战略只是建立，贸易，争取时间并专注于自己的发展和经济增长，而不用担心直接与美国对抗。每个国家都会按照自己的最大利益行事，最大限度地利用有利于其优势的优化策略。对于美国而言，这意味着以贸易战，关税，技术禁令，强迫盟友转换供应链，绑架华为首席财务官以及为中国DNA量身定做并在适当时机部署的外科生物武器的形式，直接对中国提出早期挑衅性挑战。最大影响的位置。这种生物攻击与常规战争不同，它可以使侵略者（在本例中为美利坚合众国）保留选择的选择，即对中国造成伤害而采取更加模棱两可的立场和灵活立场，但不会公开公开展示敌对行动。该病毒被设计为在高密度的亚洲环境中具有最大的破坏力，并且是一种不对称武器，因为这些条件在除中国大陆以外的世界其他任何地方都无法重现，中国大陆是全球拥有超过14亿人口的工厂高密度城市。

It would seem US is counting on the fact that China won’t respond to this attack in order to essentially score a big goal and earn major points for free. This would allow America to crash the economy of China with impunity. Even a total nonresponse is still a reply in the form of China believing it still benefits the most by ignoring this attack (and indeed not even publicly acknowledging it at all) and strictly focusing on growth path after it has recovered. Is this intended to merely knock China down a few steps off the development ladder in lieu of war in the South China Sea — since that could end up costly for US interests as well — or is it really a prelude to war, intended to severely weaken China so that an American initiated war later on would be on US terms and US timing and would be much less costly for America and the rest of the world after China had already been sufficiently decoupled and isolated from the world.

看来美国指望这样的事实，即中国基本上不会为实现这一大目标并免费获得主要积分而对这次袭击做出反应。 这将使美国不受惩罚地破坏中国的经济。 即使是完全不回应，也仍然是中国的回应，认为它仍然是最大的受益，因为它忽略了这一攻击（甚至根本没有公开承认它），并在恢复后严格关注增长道路。 这是否只是为了使中国脱离发展阶梯而不是代替南中国海的战争（因为这也可能最终损害美国利益），还是真的是战争的前奏，意在严重削弱中国？ 中国，以便以后美国发动战争将取决于美国的条件和美国的时机，而在中国已经与世界充分脱钩和孤立之后，对美国和世界其他地区来说，成本将大大降低。

I think Chinese leadership miscalculated and mistakenly believed America would never go down the biological warfare route, just like they miscalculated and never thought the US would arrest Huawei CFO, or that the Trump administration would not put Huawei on the US entity list and then lower the 25% IP rule down to 10% essentially with intent to kill Huawei by choking off its supply chain rather than just playing nice by slowing it down but still giving it room to live. Even Huawei’s recent UK “win” is capped at 35% market share restrictions, Trump had personally begged Boris to outright ban Huawei completely, so the idea that America would adopt any stance of shared prosperity or mutual win-win propositions with the number two power in the world are naïve and misguided at best.

我认为中国领导人错误估计并错误地认为美国永远不会走上生物战路线，就像他们错误估计并且从未想到美国会逮捕华为首席财务官一样，或者特朗普政府不会将华为列入美国实体名单，然后降低 25％的IP规则下调至10％，本质上是为了扼杀华为的供应链而杀死华为，而不是放慢速度，但仍然给它生存的空间。 甚至华为最近在英国的“双赢”都被限制在35％的市场份额限制之内，特朗普亲自恳求鲍里斯彻底禁止华为，因此，美国将采取任何共同繁荣的立场或与第二大国互惠共赢的主张。 世界上的幼稚和误导充其量。

Would it actually serve to prolong / restore American hegemony or would it inadvertently accomplish the opposite? Hard to tell but hindsight is always 20/20 and it would seem by America initiating the recent decoupling with China that it has already tacitly admitted that its opening up with China with the Nixon approachment was a strategic blunder of a mistake. The Soviet Union was going to collapse on its own sooner or later, but America’s warming up to China to further isolate the USSR was indeed an overplay in retrospect. America at the time believed opening up China would force it to be Westernized and made more democratic and ultimately serve American interests by bolstering US hegemony. Instead, China grew up and had other plans for itself. Taking out Mao Zedong’s son in Korea with napalms was probably on the whole detrimental to US interests’ long term, although it seemed like a great win at the time. Likewise, the Five Eyes Intelligence Agencies, led by the American CIA/NSA, ambushing and kidnapping Meng Wanzhou (the CFO of Huawei and also the daughter of the Huawei CEO Mr. Ren Zhengfei) at the Canadian border also did not have the sort of effect that the US had hoped it would achieve. Ren Zhengfei believes strongly in meritocracy and was never going to hand the reigns of his company Huawei to his daughter anyway. Had Mao handed the country to his son its very likely China would have opened up to the world many decades later than what had been achieved by Deng Xiaoping. And today America would still be the sole unipolar hyperpower instead of Pompeo running around the world telling everyone that China is the “central threat of our times”.

它会实际上起到延长/恢复美国霸权的作用，还是会无意间实现相反的目的？很难说，但事后的看法总是20/20，而美国似乎开始与中国脱钩，它已经默认地承认，随着尼克松的到来对华开放是一个错误的战略失误。苏联迟早会自行崩溃，但回想起来，美国对中国的升温使苏联进一步孤立，的确是夸大其词。当时的美国认为，开放中国将迫使中国西化，使其更加民主，并通过加强美国霸权最终为美国利益服务。相反，中国成长了，并有自己的其他计划。尽管当时这似乎是一个巨大的胜利，但以凝固汽油弹杀死毛泽东在韩国的儿子可能总体上不利于美国的长期利益。同样，由美国中央情报局/国家安全局牵头的五眼情报机构在加拿大边境埋伏并绑架了孟万洲（华为的首席财务官，也是华为首席执行官任正非先生的女儿）。美国希望能够达到的效果。任正非坚信精英管理，无论如何也永远不会将华为公司的统治权交给女儿。如果毛泽东把这个国家交给他的儿子，它很有可能比邓小平实现的开放晚了几十年。如今，美国仍将是唯一的单极超级大国，而不是庞培（Pompeo）在世界各地奔波，告诉所有人中国是“我们时代的中心威胁”。

Graham Allison often said that it would take some imaginative creative thinking to overcome the Thucydides Trap between China and the United States. The rising power doesn’t want to kowtow and suffer the fate of Japan’s four lost decade after acquiescing to the Plaza Accord ‘trade deal’, and the declining incumbent ruling power doesn’t want to give up its status and position and even the mere thought of détente is out the window as the American way of life is “nonnegotiable”. So what is left is the realization in Washington that time is on China’s side, and that if a military confrontation is inevitable anyway, then it would be advantageous for the US to strike first while it still retained the edge and initiative. But absent an immediate kinetic force what other options are there to slow China down? Perhaps this is the creative imaginative solution alluded to by Allison, we have seen this virus cause the closing of borders, the pulling out of international companies and the re-routing of global supply chains to bypass China, and physical isolation of China without so much as a single bullet fired or sanction applied, it at once accomplished all the political objectives with none of the traditional political costs associated, no certain attribution, and thus also no blowback nor retribution.

格雷厄姆·艾里森（Graham Allison）经常说，要克服中美之间的修昔底德陷阱，需要一些富有想象力的创造性思维。崛起的大国不想在接受《广场协议》的“贸易协议”后ko丧并遭受日本失去的四个十年的命运，而现任统治权的下降也不想放弃其地位和地位，甚至不愿放弃它。由于美国的生活方式是“不可谈判的”，因此对缓和主义的思索已经超出了人们的视野。因此，剩下的就是华盛顿意识到时间在中国一边了，如果无论如何不可避免地发生军事对抗，那么在美国仍然保留优势和主动性的情况下先发动进攻将是有利的。但是如果没有即时动能，还有什么其他选择可以减缓中国的发展速度呢？也许这是艾莉森（Allison）提出的富有想象力的创造性解决方案，我们已经看到这种病毒导致边界关闭，国际公司的撤离以及全球供应链的重新路由以绕过中国，以及对中国的实际隔离没有太多一旦实施了单发子弹或制裁，它就立即实现了所有政治目标，而没有任何相关的传统政治成本，没有确定的归属，因此也没有倒退或报应。

Dear YSM Faculty:

In follow-up to recent communications from President Salovey, Provost Strobel, and me, basic science chairs and directors convened today to discuss the meaning of critical or essential work in the laboratory setting. As the situation on-the-ground around COVID evolves, so must our definition of critical and essential functions in the laboratory.

As always, the safety and well-being of our students, faculty, staff, and patients are our priority.

At this time, examples of critical laboratory work include research on the causes and mechanisms of viral (COVID-19) infection; therapeutic clinical research studies; monitoring of the safety and efficacy of patients in ongoing clinical trials; testing of patient/research samples for ongoing clinical trials that cannot be paused; and other lab work that impacts the immediate safety and health of our patients and community. Preservation of precious resources such as cell lines or animals so as to avoid the disruption of months or years of work may also be viewed as critical, in which case specific team members should be identified to maintain these resources and complete critical experiments.

Investigators or lab members should not come to work if they are having symptoms, and all should practice social distancing. It is important to note that investigators can be very productive while working from home. Some have expressed concerns about the impact of decreased productivity on their life’s work and career development; please know that the university and YSM will be developing a policy to extend the tenure clock commensurate with the duration of interruptions.

I hope you guys are all safe and having some good ""home-office"" time. I am writing to you to ask for your kind advice. I would really appreciate your help!  


I was recently admitted to the MA in Global Affairs at Jackson Institute, Yale and the MPA in Development Practice at SIPA, Columbia. I am an international student, with big dreams to pursue a career in international development. While both schools gave me really generous offers, and I feel so privileged to have to choose between both, after really not being able to be in a position of choice for all my life. However, I am really in need of communicating my fears.  


\- I feel like while Jackson institute could be great for an American student who wants to proceed in diplomacy and work in the state department, for example, it would still not be as efficient as SIPA for an international student. Am I wrong in this assumption?  


\- Do you think that Jackson would offer sufficient practical experience or would it be more theory-based? Do you think that an MA in Global Affairs can still boost someone's career in International Development vs Diplomacy?   


\- New Haven vs New York: when it comes to networking, and finding internships?   


\- Can I  get IT, Cyber Security, Big Data Analysis, or more practical ID skills at Yale vs SIPA?
