I'm currently taking a gap year so it's been pretty hard to meet new people. I was wondering if there's anyone that has similar interests who would be down to hang out or something.

6pz8vt,https://www.reddit.com/r/georgetown/comments/6pz8vt/secrets_of_campus/,Secrets of Campus,14,8,2017-07-27 14:38:34,"I will now review the secrets hidden among the banners gleaming in Georgetown's blue and gray. This arcane knowledge took me two years to collect. I share it with you in hopes that a) you become the coolest person in your NSO group and b) all of you pursue new secrets and don't keep discovering the same things. I am leaving out a few details to protect the guilty.

at GUPD: my knowledge of these locations is completely secondhand and not a confession that I have been to all of them.

sub-Healy Tunnels: The first stop on a tour of the Georgetown obscure is the tunnels under Healy. They are accessible through the ""Rain Door,"" which is accessed by opening a gate next to a tunnel near Dahlgren. The door is only unlocked after a heavy rain. Entering leads you to the university's steam pipe distribution venue. If you crawl through a hole in the wall, you'll end up in a series of pitch black and piping hot tunnels, from which you can access the Davis Performing Arts Center and the front of Healy Hall. Painted on the walls are sentimental recollections of secret societies of Georgetown yore, most prominently the knives and fives, Crux Orbis, and SigEp (not really a secret but they did a nice paint job). Allegedly one part of the tunnel used to lead to Walsh, but it has since been bricked up. Many workers have been reported entering and exiting the tunnels. It is likely the makeup has changed fundamentally over the last few months. The university has ambitions to convert this glitter-covered cave (and short list candidate for Exorcist locations) into more offices. Approach with caution. One note: there is a strange broken ladder that would theoretically go up the north Healy tower. Let me know if anyone wants to climb it.

The Russian Door: Not as fun as the Tunnels. Climb the Healy stairs nearest to VilA and you'll find a severely damaged door with Russian writing over the door. I had someone translate it for me once but I forget what it said. I heard rumors my first year of somebody getting through, but they wouldn't say what is behind it. Pretty boring, but worth a look.

Healy Tower: The Holy Grail of Georgetown spelunking is getting up into the clock tower. Security is extremely heavy. I'm work-study, so I've never tried. Admin took a friend of mine up and she said the security is heavier than they let on. And Gruber's fingerprint thing is BS.

Reiss Tunnels: In a classroom on the main floor of Reiss there is a door. That door leads into an impossibly long hallway filled with rusted pipes and random household objects. Looks like something from House of Leaves. Follow the tunnel, and you'll find yourself in Kober-Cogan, MedStar's abandoned psychiatric unit.

Kober-Cogan (home to MK-ULTRA): Kober-Cogan is a six floor abandoned office facility that the university doesn't have the cash to knock down. Ignorant people enter through a window. Smart people go through Reiss. It's creepy. On the lower levels, you'll find rooms with restraints and gurneys and writing on the walls. On the upper floors you'll find plenty of office supplies. K-C was allegedly abandoned midday due to an asbestos assessment. Last time some folks tried to go there GUPD was monitoring the Reiss entrance. Rumor has it admin is getting ready to demolish the building.

.#BirdsChirpingManiacally: Alas, #BirdsChirpingManically is no longer with us. If you entered a particular door of Leavey and climbed the stairs, you found yourself in a room with #BirdsChirpingManically painted on a wall. On the wall there was a tac board. Remove the board and you could enter an abandoned elevator shaft covered in -- frankly -- disturbing drawings. I went there last year for auld lang syne and the university had bricked up my elevator shaft.

The Observatory: Use this one sparingly. Up on the far side of campus next to Kehoe Field there is an almost-abandoned observatory and a nice garden with a few discrete benches. Respect the garden. Everybody is always trying to break into the observatory. Wonder no longer. Join the Astronomy Club. They have the key to the observatory and go there Tuesday nights. Join us in leeching off their free food and enjoying the view from the tower.

Key Bridge: Allegedly one of the secret societies has a tunnel to the base of Key Bridge. If you look at the base of Key Bridge, there are a series of doors. I've never been inside to find out what's there.

Walsh Tunnels: Go into the men's restroom at the bottom of the stairs in Walsh. There is a door. It's locked now but it used to not be. It leads to an extensive tunnel network that is much creepier and much more dangerous than the one under Healy. One might burn one's hand on an exposed pipe.

Bonus - Stewards Clock: Want to impress your NSO group with your knowledge of our dysfunctional, factionalized secret society? Look at the base of the misplaced clock in Red Square. The brass plaque memorializes some guy, says he's a *Steward* and has two keys (their symbol). 

Double Bonus - at one point someone mentioned a secret room in New South. That would require going in New South, so I haven't been.

Dear Georgetown Faculty and Staff,

As we approach the final weeks of the spring semester, we continue to navigate the challenges the COVID-19 pandemic has presented to our community. At the end of last month, we announced that all [Main Campus Summer 2020 instruction would be moved to virtual delivery](http://links.georgetown.mkt6170.com/ctt?kn=2&amp;ms=NDIyNjgwMTQS1&amp;r=NzE1OTM0OTU3OTIS1&amp;b=0&amp;j=MTc0MTU4NzE5OQS2&amp;mt=1&amp;rt=0). The Law Center also moved online all of its summer classes for continuing J.D. and LL.M students. 

In addition to the continuation of the virtual learning environment, today we are announcing that **all in-person summer programs scheduled to be held on the Main Campus, the School of Continuing Studies campus and Law Center campus through August 9, 2020 will need to be shifted to an online-only format or otherwise be canceled.**

With approaching summer program deadlines and continuing uncertainty regarding the duration of “stay-at-home orders” and social distancing guidelines, we concluded that this is the best course of action to ensure the health and safety for all. No in-person housing, event or athletic space will be provided for summer programming, including camps and conferences. All Main Campus summer conference deposits through August 9 will be fully refunded. As we move forward, we will prioritize Main Campus orientation programs and pre-sessions associated with the fall semester. For more information, please contact conferencehousing@georgetown.edu.

We recognize there are several academic programs at the Medical Center and Law Center that are part of the upcoming academic year and that would typically begin in July or early August, prior to August 9. Participants in those programs will hear directly from their program directors in the weeks ahead with information on the delivery of those activities.

We will be following-up on [travel guidance](http://links.georgetown.mkt6170.com/ctt?kn=1&amp;ms=NDIyNjgwMTQS1&amp;r=NzE1OTM0OTU3OTIS1&amp;b=0&amp;j=MTc0MTU4NzE5OQS2&amp;mt=1&amp;rt=0) for the summer in the days ahead.

As a reminder, the Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship (CNDLS) is available to support faculty and staff in transitioning programs and activities to remote formats. If, after careful consideration, a program cannot be transitioned to a virtual environment, it must be rescheduled or canceled. For all questions about the transition to virtual delivery for summer programs, please consult your program chairs, deans and department heads.

We understand how disruptive these necessary decisions are for our community. As we continue to evaluate the latest health guidance and safety procedures, we will revisit these decisions as circumstances allow. 

Thank you all for your commitment and dedication. We are very grateful for your extraordinary efforts.

Sincerely,

June 9, 2020

Dear Members of the Georgetown University Community:

As we begin our summer period, I wish to provide an overview of how we are preparing for the coming academic year, the practical assumptions that are guiding our decision-making, and what will be important for us to return to our campuses this Fall.  Since the very beginning of the pandemic, our community has come together in extraordinary ways, and I wish to again thank you for how you have enabled our University to respond, as we confront the challenges and the uncertainty of this moment.

We face complex and challenging decisions that require the most careful planning and preparation.  We are focused on the ways that we can protect the health and safety of each member of our community and pursue our academic mission during a time of serious risk and uncertainty.  We are animated by moral commitments that have shaped our community since our founding—including *cura personalis*, a deep sense of care for each person—and our commitment to the three foundational aspects of our mission—the formation of our students; the inquiry of our faculty; and our service to the common good.

This has been a time of great difficulty.  Many of us are experiencing deep grief and pain for the people we have lost and the ways that our lives have been impacted as a result of this global pandemic.  We realize, with particular pain, the disproportionate experience of the worst impacts of COVID-19 on essential workers—in healthcare, in roles that support our daily lives—and in African American communities and communities of color.  We recognize the imperative we have, moving forward, of strengthening our vision of a community deeply invested in the care of each person.  Doing so requires us to direct our energy not only to our response to COVID-19, but also to issues of equity and justice, and to issues of racism, violence and police brutality that we must now face with renewed urgency.  As I shared in my [letter to our community on May 31](https://president.georgetown.edu/confronting-racism-may-2020/?utm_source=SilverpopMailing&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Update%20on%20Fall%20Planning%20(1)&amp;utm_content=), this is a moment that demands our personal, civic, and institutional engagement.

**Planning for Fall**

As we approach the Fall, our planning is focused on how we can provide for the safe return of the members of our community and how we can work to sustain their safety over the course of their time at Georgetown—in our residence halls, classrooms, and gathering places across our campuses, given the risks posed by COVID-19.

Over the past several weeks, we have convened groups of colleagues to support planning efforts in key areas, including public health, academic options, operations, and finance.  On our faculty, we have some of the world’s leading experts in public health and these colleagues have helped us understand the range of actions and conditions that will enable us to safely return to our campuses.  Our academic leaders have worked to develop hybrid and flexible approaches to sustaining our educational mission as the conditions of the pandemic change. And our operations and finance colleagues are developing frameworks to support and sustain a return to campus.

**ReOpen DC**

It is important to understand that we are developing our plans within the framework provided by [ReOpen DC—the plan for the District of Columbia](https://coronavirus.dc.gov/reopendc). Returning to our campuses will require the approval of city authorities.  The *ReOpen DC* plan was released on May 21, and it outlines a four-stage approach for the city’s reopening, including the reopening of colleges and universities.

On May 29, Mayor Muriel Bowser announced that the District would move into Phase One of its plan, which lifts the “stay-at-home order” that she imposed on March 30 and provides for the resumption of “*certain activities—where the risk of transmission has been determined to be low and when strong safeguards are in place…*”  Phase One continues to require social distancing of at least six feet from persons not in one’s household, wearing a mask or face covering, and the prohibition of gatherings of more than ten individuals.  Colleges and universities in the District of Columbia are not permitted to resume on-campus activities under Phase One.

*ReOpen DC* stipulates that colleges and universities will be able to resume on-campus activities once two conditions are met: first, the city moves into Phase Two, and second, the city approves each college and university’s plan for returning to campus. Over the past few weeks, our colleagues here at Georgetown have been deeply engaged in the development of these plans.

**Practical Assumptions**

In developing our plans, we are guided by a set of assumptions that inform our work:

*Health and Safety*:  Our first priority is to the health and safety of our community—students, faculty, and staff.  We will be guided by the data, evidence, and expertise of our scientific and public health communities.

*Academic Mission*: It is in the interest of our academic mission to welcome as many students as is safely possible to in-person instruction in the Fall.

*Timing of Medical Advances*: We do not see significant advances in a safe and effective vaccine becoming widely available by the end of 2020.

*Layered Public Health Framework*: We will be able to implement a layered public health framework. Elements of a layered framework include regular self-screening for symptoms; temperature checks; social distancing; face coverings; readily available testing and contact tracing; isolation of those contracting the disease; quarantine for those with significant contact with those with the disease; deep cleaning of public spaces; and reducing crowd sizes.  While no framework can eliminate all risk, such a layered approach is integral to our efforts to work to mitigate risk.  We will identify the policies and processes that enable this commitment.

*Adherence*: Effective health and safety measures depend on the active participation by members of our community.

*Hybrid-Flexible Academic Models*: We will be prepared to conduct hybrid and flexible models of learning that span a continuum from on-campus to fully-virtual, determined by relevant factors, including our ability to meet our public health responsibilities and the needs of our community.  We are preparing for multiple options depending upon the changing state of pandemic conditions in the District of Columbia and on our ability to fulfill our obligations for public health on the Georgetown campuses.

*Varying Impact*: The implications of COVID-19 result in impacts that vary in severity across different members of our community.  We will exert special effort to anticipate and address these variations.

*Differentiation of Academic Programs*: We will be adaptive to the differences across our academic programs.  The needs of Law, Medical, and Graduate education can differ from those of undergraduate and residential students.

*Financial Capacity*: We will have the financial resources to prepare for and support the 2020-2021 academic year.  Given the demands of putting in place the public health framework in support of the health and safety of our community, and strengthening the virtual learning environment, we do not yet know the full extent of the costs for this coming year.

*Infrastructure*: We will be able to adapt and expand the infrastructure of our campuses—including classrooms, laboratories, residence halls, dining halls—to address the new needs for public health.

*Second Surge of Infection*: We will have the capability of responding to the possibility of another surge of infection during the course of 2020-2021, in the event we experience such a threat to the health and safety of our community.

**Emerging Scenarios for the Fall**

These assumptions have guided our planning work and are shaping a range of scenarios that will provide us with the best opportunities to return to our campuses this Fall, should conditions allow.  We will continue to work closely with the District of Columbia Departments of Health and Planning to ensure that the plans we develop are in accordance with the framework of *ReOpen DC*.

Recognizing that the need to manage density will make it impossible to return to normal this Fall, we are exploring approaches ranging from fully-virtual to approaches that balance virtual learning with on-campus presence—understanding that the needs across our campuses require differentiated approaches.  The needs for managing the public health of a residential undergraduate community are different than those for our graduate students, as well as for our professional students at our Law Center, Medical Center, and School of Continuing Studies.  For example, the steps to support our research laboratories will be different from those for our libraries.

Robert Groves, our Provost, is coordinating the preparations regarding the modality of the undergraduate and graduate programs with the deans of the Main Campus; William Treanor, our Executive Vice President and Dean, is developing the elements of our J.D., S.J.D., and LL.M. programs at the Law Center; Edward Healton, our Executive Vice President and Executive Dean, is overseeing our planning for the return of our research community to the laboratories, the resumption of clinical training for our 3rd and 4th year Medical students and our range of Nursing programs, as well as our 1st and 2nd year Preclinical Medical education and our programs in Biomedical Graduate Education.

We are also developing approaches to bringing our employees back to campus.  Over the last few months, we have learned a great deal about how to operate effectively in an environment where a majority of our colleagues are working remotely.  As we develop approaches for a return to campus, we will assess which members of our workforce will need to prepare to return to campus, and which members can continue to work remotely as we navigate the circumstances of the pandemic.

Given our first priority is the health and safety of our community, and how much we are still learning about the virus, we will work closely with the members of our student body, faculty and staff to consider and address particular challenges they anticipate with a return to campus.

Beginning in the next few days, we will issue a series of communications on our planning for each of our campuses.  We will provide clear and regular communications as we reach greater clarity about the upcoming academic year, and specifically about the range of fully-virtual to hybrid-flexible approaches that will guide each campus.  The most challenging set of issues, given the density of our residential campus, are those involving our undergraduates.  It is our intent to provide a full scope of our plans over the course of the coming weeks.

I am deeply grateful to all of our colleagues whose work is ensuring we can be prepared for this Fall.

I wish each of you the very best as we navigate this moment together, supported by one another and the enduring values that bind us as a community.  You have my deepest appreciation.

Sincerely,

John J. DeGioia"

I attended one of their summer high school programs and really enjoyed it, but obviously it was on zoom so I don’t really know if I got the correct vibe. I have a few questions that I think might help me decide:

1. Do students get an opportunity to be creative? For example, are classes hands on, are there arts-related events on campus, are there specific classes or electives people can take related to arts and writing?

2. How much does administration affect daily life? I’ve heard from other students that they can be kind of strict and inconvenient. 

3. Does georgetown offer quality student resources? I don’t have a solid idea of what degree or career I’m looking into so I really want programs or services that I can turn to, like career guidance or faculty that is available to talk. Do you or someone you know have experience being an undecided major?

4. This one is more general, but do students have fun? Have you enjoyed your time at Georgetown, and is there anything you wish you could change?

5. What does a typical class look like? Mainly lectures, labs, projects, etc? I’m looking more for a school that doesn’t just feel like harder high school classes, but like I’m really learning quality information in a quality manner. 

6. This isn’t so much a question but more of a worry: one thing that is holding me back is that I’m not super interested in the SFS or any of their speciality schools, so I’m worried that it wouldn’t be worth it to apply as someone in the College because it’s not what Georgetown is really known from what I’ve seen. Can anyone in the College talk about their experience?

Thank you so much!"

November 16, 2020

Dear Members of the Georgetown University Community:

I write today to share details about Georgetown’s plans for the Spring semester. In this message, I will provide information about our Spring approach, which will focus on bringing seniors back to campus and providing some in-person learning experiences for seniors, graduate and professional students. Our campus leaders will soon send you follow-up messages with more detail about the Spring on particular campuses.

These are profoundly hard decisions, and in navigating through this difficult time, we are guided by our first priority—the safety of our community. It is a foundation for all of our decision-making. I recognize the weariness that many of us feel about the impacts of this pandemic—the disruptions and restrictions on daily life, how much it has upended our routines. For all of us, this is not how we would like to be operating and I understand the disappointment and frustration that comes with these circumstances.

As I write to you today, we are experiencing an unprecedented surge of COVID-19 infections in the United States. COVID-19 cases in our country are higher than they have ever been and are rising exponentially. My [weekly video presentation](http://links.georgetown.mkt6170.com/els/v1/erz3fLx24xB7/M1lXV1ZTRHdIc3N3S0N6OWZJcjFVeEg3VkVlb3k5bUtXYjRFSGJiZVJUYXhvUW80ODlBWVlyQU5aUGFpcmRvNE1CK2FKZndZbFQ3U1dXbTY0dUVDeHVjY3lhUVZJRE5vbEdmckZOTEx6Ylk9S0/) describes some of the decisions that I outline below and provides additional context on the extremely serious situation we are all facing. As I share in the video, all of our plans are provisional and subject to modification. Our plan will also be submitted for review and acceptance by the Washington, D.C. government.

**Residential Community**

This Fall, we had approximately 500 students living in our residence halls on the Main Campus. Going forward, we plan to double this number, bringing back approximately 500 additional seniors, members of the undergraduate Class of 2021, who currently live outside of the Washington, D.C. area. Seniors will hear from the Office of Residential Living tomorrow, November 17, with more details on this process. Additionally, a small number of exceptions may be granted for undergraduate students whose living situations have changed substantially and who no longer have stable housing. Our Law Center will also increase the number of residential students on our Law campus.

We know how eager the members of our community are to return, particularly our first-year and transfer students who have had to delay the beginning of their time on campus, and the disappointment that comes with this decision. Given the current state of the pandemic, we are not able to bring more members of our community to campus at this time. We will continue to monitor this closely and will be prepared to bring additional students to campus, should conditions considerably improve.

For the undergraduate Class of 2024, we are developing a special residential Summer semester that will provide an opportunity for students to live on campus and take credit-bearing courses before they begin their sophomore year, provided public health conditions allow. This program will be optional and will allow students additional time to experience residential life at Georgetown.

**Mode of Instruction**

All courses will be offered virtually.

On the Main Campus, we are planning to introduce some hybrid courses—virtual courses that have in-person components—for senior undergraduate students—both those in residence on campus and those living in the Washington, D.C., area—and for students in the Graduate School.

This semester we implemented 17 pilot programs to explore in-person learning. In the Spring, contingent on pandemic conditions, we are planning approximately 200 hybrid courses for senior undergraduate and graduate students on the Main Campus.

We are also planning for some hybrid academic experiences for Medical, Nursing, and Law students. These programs will provide some students the option of being physically present in the classroom for in-person elements of a course, as conditions permit. All of our students will receive specific, detailed information about the hybrid approaches for their school or academic program. Our School of Continuing Studies has previously announced its intention to be virtual in the Spring.

We will follow a revised academic calendar, with undergraduate courses beginning on January 25. Specific details regarding the updated calendar will be provided by appropriate schools and programs.

**Study and Recreation Opportunities**

Over the course of the Spring semester, we are looking at providing new opportunities for studying and gathering on campus. A reservation system will provide access to certain key campus locations—with strict adherence to our public health program, including participation in our [Community Compact](http://links.georgetown.mkt6170.com/els/v1/j~g_BdRekRJR/M1lXV1ZTRHdIc3N3S0N6OWZJcjFVeEg3VkVlb3k5bUtXYjRFSGJiZVJUYXhvUW80ODlBWVlyQU5aUGFpcmRvNE1CK2FKZndZbFQ3U1dXbTY0dUVDeHVjY3lhUVZJRE5vbEdmckZOTEx6Ylk9S0/QVptR0lKWUJ5S0FxRFNrTXhhMjFxZ3NkYVYwVXVBNXpyaTZpaUVDL2ErZGlIMy9rYkdHbFZFeXM1bDNhaElySAS2), testing, mask wearing, physical distancing, and limited gathering sizes. On the Main Campus, we will be rolling out access gradually and prioritizing seniors and residential students first. We are also looking at opening spaces specific to graduate and professional students. We may need to modify our approach as conditions of the pandemic change or local ordinances about physical space and public health are updated.

**WeWork Partnership**

We are working to provide domestic and international students with access to quiet study spaces and internet access off campus, at no cost, through a new partnership with WeWork, which has office space for individuals in 800 locations in 32 U.S. cities and in 88 cities around the world.

**Our Planning**

Throughout these past few months, we have been guided by local and national public health experts and public health ordinances, and we have closely followed the work of researchers to deepen our understanding of the virus. We reviewed [our assumptions](http://links.georgetown.mkt6170.com/els/v1/6dqYcjYm_YFm/M1lXV1ZTRHdIc3N3S0N6OWZJcjFVeEg3VkVlb3k5bUtXYjRFSGJiZVJUYXhvUW80ODlBWVlyQU5aUGFpcmRvNE1CK2FKZndZbFQ3U1dXbTY0dUVDeHVjY3lhUVZJRE5vbEdmckZOTEx6Ylk9S0/) and [our approach](http://links.georgetown.mkt6170.com/els/v1/RaE9TzYepYT8/M1lXV1ZTRHdIc3N3S0N6OWZJcjFVeEg3VkVlb3k5bUtXYjRFSGJiZVJUYXhvUW80ODlBWVlyQU5aUGFpcmRvNE1CK2FKZndZbFQ3U1dXbTY0dUVDeHVjY3lhUVZJRE5vbEdmckZOTEx6Ylk9S0/) with our public health team—whose members have expertise in infectious diseases, public health, global health, epidemiology, vaccines, and health law and who have helped us to interpret and project how COVID-19 might impact our community. These are individuals working in clinical settings—treating patients of all ages who have been diagnosed with COVID-19—laboratory researchers, and physician-scientists who are conducting their own research, and policy and legal professionals who have additional responsibilities advising entities around the world on the COVID-19 response.

Our faculty have provided extensive input as part of our academic planning.

We have held regular forums with members of our staff, going back to last Spring, to share updates and respond to questions. We have also engaged the members of our Board of Directors and our special Board working group who have advised us as we developed our plans. We have consulted with graduate and undergraduate students, and we have heard from many families about how best to approach the Spring.

I know that this is not the message that many in our community hoped to hear when looking ahead to next semester. We understand the disappointment in not being able to fully return to campus and how eager our community is to be together in person. We recognize how important a residential experience can be in the lives of our students and appreciate the strong desire to return to residential life.

These are challenging decisions. We will continue to monitor the state of the pandemic and may find it necessary to make adjustments at a future time. In the coming days, you will receive additional information from your campus leaders. I also encourage you to visit the University’s [COVID-19 Resource Center website](http://links.georgetown.mkt6170.com/els/v1/XX8NsbWzwWsx/M1lXV1ZTRHdIc3N3S0N6OWZJcjFVeEg3VkVlb3k5bUtXYjRFSGJiZVJUYXhvUW80ODlBWVlyQU5aUGFpcmRvNE1CK2FKZndZbFQ3U1dXbTY0dUVDeHVjY3lhUVZJRE5vbEdmckZOTEx6Ylk9S0/QVptR0lKWUJ5S0FxRFNrTXhhMjFxZ3NkYVYwVXVBNXpyaTZpaUVDL2ErZGlIMy9rYkdHbFZFeXM1bDNhaElySAS2) and these [frequently asked questions](http://links.georgetown.mkt6170.com/els/v1/GRGysx_9a_T0/M1lXV1ZTRHdIc3N3S0N6OWZJcjFVeEg3VkVlb3k5bUtXYjRFSGJiZVJUYXhvUW80ODlBWVlyQU5aUGFpcmRvNE1CK2FKZndZbFQ3U1dXbTY0dUVDeHVjY3lhUVZJRE5vbEdmckZOTEx6Ylk9S0/QVptR0lKWUJ5S0FxRFNrTXhhMjFxZ3NkYVYwVXVBNXpyaTZpaUVDL2ErZGlIMy9rYkdHbFZFeXM1bDNhaElySAS2), which are updated regularly.

We are a community of 26,000 people. The virus impacts all of us. The actions we take have an impact on those around us. We share these plans with you at a very uncertain and challenging time. As we enter the winter months—widely anticipated as the most dangerous time for the pandemic—we face uncontrolled spread of COVID-19 in nearly all states. We will be closely following the trajectory of the pandemic and making adjustments to our plans, guided by our commitment to the health and safety of our community.

Our colleagues have worked tirelessly this past semester to sustain our virtual learning environment, to implement our public health program, and to develop these plans for the Spring. I cannot express deeply enough my appreciation for our faculty, our students, and our staff. For the ways that our University has come together, supported one another, and cared for our community, I am sincerely grateful.

Sincerely,

John J. DeGioia"

So I’m aware Georgetown has strong Jesuit values and I really align with a lot of them, and I’m also really interested in theology, but I’m an atheist. I was just wondering if any atheist or nonreligious people could tell me about their experience at Georgetown? How much is religion emphasized at the school?"

My girlfriend went to GU for undergrad and Med school. I saw a girl walking today with a Pom beanie with ‘Temple Medicine’ on it.

Any ideas as to where/how I could get something like that?

The school seems extremely study/work based. To be blunt - is it fun? Or do you spend pretty much all of your time studying or going to class?

I get the impression the dorms and food suck. Is this the case?

Are a lot of people thee SJW/their whole personality is their political views?

Is the campus nice?

So far I haven’t found anything that I don’t like except the housing requirement. At the school that used to be my top choice, I had planned on living in the dorms for a year and then getting an apartment and brining my dog. I know Georgetown has a three-year housing requirement, and my dog isn’t an ESA or a service dog so I couldn’t bring him into the dorms. It’s probably not possible but is there any way I could bypass the housing requirement? Even just being allowed to live off campus for junior and senior year would be fine. Bringing my dog is pretty important to me since I train him and am planning on doing trials with him in different sports. Has anyone else brought a pet to campus that wasn’t an ESA or a service dog?"

I graduated law school this May and will be starting at a law firm in DC very soon. I'm still apartment hunting but I hope to end up in the Penn Quarter or Logan Circle area. My dog is \~15lbs and very, very chill. But she doesn't like to be alone for more than a few hours and she wouldn't do well going to a crowded doggie daycare 5x/week. On top of that, I'm worried that I'm going to have a lot of after-work events that will me from picking her up from daycare on time. 

I'm looking for some kind of arrangement where 3x/week you walk my dog after your classes are done (\~45m) and then just kind of hang out with her in my apartment for a couple hours afterward. You can watch HBO, eat my snacks, drink my wine, do your school work from my place, and hang out with my dog while she sleeps and gnaws on a rawhide. The apartment buildings I'm looking at have great amenities, so you can even hang out at the rooftop pool....just bring the doggie with you! I'm thinking 4-6ish? I haven't fully worked everything out, so I'm flexible and open to suggestions.
