5u0r5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Syracuse/comments/5u0r5p/snow_shoveling_lpt_from_a_longtime_syracuse/,Snow shoveling LPT from a longtime Syracuse resident.,28,15,2017-02-14 07:19:47,"Ever had a snow shovel that gets loaded up with wet sticky snow that simply doesn't want to let go of the blade? It really sucks and can really add to the strain on your back, shoulders and arms. If you have had problems with snow sticking to the surface of your snow shovel, making it difficult to unload and heavy to use, try these easy steps:


-Before using your shovel, take it inside and clean the blade as well as you can. Rinse the blade with warm water and then thoroughly dry it. Dirt and salt on the surface of your shovel gives the snow and ice something to grab onto. 


-Take a rag or a paper towel and apply a *thin* coating of Crisco shortening or cooking oil to the warmed shovel blade (I find Crisco to work the best, but if you don't have any available, regular cooking oil will do). Use the rag to work the shortening/oil into the surface of the blade, especially over any scratches or rough spots.


-Take another clean rag* and wipe off any excess shortening/oil. Now when you use the shovel, it will have a very thin lubricated surface that the snow will  simply slide off of. 


-Finally, store the shovel where it will remain COLD. A warm snow shovel will initially cause the snow to melt and then, once it cools down, the melt water will refreeze on the surface, creating a layer of ice that will grab onto clumps of snow. By keeping the shovel where it will be as cold as the snow, that melting/refreezing process will be minimized. 


(* I store these rags in an airtight zip-lok bag in my garage next to my rock-salt. Whenever I need, I just give the shovel a quick wipedown to recoat the surface). "

I guarantee you there is not.  How about enough neighbors to help the elderly, poor, and sick on your street?  Probably not in some of the more disenfranchised and economically segregated neighborhoods.  If, like me, you want to see a different plan for our city, a step forward and an initiative to say we are the snowiest city in America, and we can take care of our residents, keep children safe walking to school, and make for a city that thrives in Winter and not just survives, then sign up to be kept in the loop of upcoming proposed legislative changes and strategic planning for municipal sidewalk snow management implementation.

If anyone is planning on coming to visit my lovely city to see a game I would love to buy you a round of beers (we were voted Beer City a couple of years ago). My wife and I can show you around a little bit and recommend some great places to eat and drink.

I have a bonus to offer! Today I bought two tickets when they went on sale the morning at 10am. At $45 a piece plus an arm and a leg for service fees I have seats in the second row right next to the tunnel by the Crunch's bench for Friday's game (game one; section 123). I am willing to make a deal to benefit a Syracuse fan. All I ask for is two seats with a decent view in the lower section. We can work out details.

We put on events around town that we hope are interesting and somewhat unique.  We've got one coming up next Saturday (07/29) called the Tipp Hill Scavenger Crawl.

We've done it downtown a couple of times now, and we're bringing it to Tipp Hill.  Basically, it's a combination of a pub crawl and a photo scavenger hunt.  Everyone meets at Coleman's between noon and 1 to check in and get your crawl passport, then at 1:00 everyone gets a list of items and activities they have to find and do in Tipp Hill.  We've built a website, and you upload the pictures you take directly to your teams account.  We verify that the picture is of what it's supposed to be, then you get points.  There's a real-time leaderboard so you can see how you're doing.  Your team also has a passport, and every participating bar you go to and make a purchase you get a stamp in that passport.  A lot of the pictures you'll need to take will be in and around those same bars.

At 4pm, everyone comes back to Coleman's and we close submissions.  There's an afterparty with live music until 6:30.  We finalize your scores and give away a bunch of prizes (including best team costume on the theme of 'Movies').

Tickets are $10 and include drink specials at every bar and entry into a bunch of giveaway prize drawings.  Teams can be anywhere from 2 to 8 people.

Just thought I'd throw it out there if anyone is looking for something to do.  If you think you would like to play but don't have a team, let me know.. I've been toying with the idea of putting together teams of free agents.

6rhqr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Syracuse/comments/6rhqr5/syracuse_first_impressions/,Syracuse: first impressions,103,55,2017-08-03 20:03:46,"Just moved to Syracuse a month ago. Another new resident posted some negative first-impressions right around the time I moved here (and got 160+ replies, some sympathetic, some hostile). I've had the opposite experience; I'm posting just to say that I really love it here, and to explain why. (Perhaps some other new arrivals will see this message and take heart.)

My background: early 30s, have lived for many years (each) in the DC area, Chicago, and Boston. I enjoyed living in all of those places, but there are a lot of things about Syracuse in particular that I really appreciate:

1) The spectacular surroundings. Nowhere I've lived has such natural beauty--and so much of it-- so close by. The waterfalls, the turquoise & crystaline lakes, the hundreds of miles of scenic hiking trails, the wildflowers everywhere...  I don't know where to start.
 
2) The cost of living. In Boston, I lived in a dank, rat-infested basement studio adjoining a boiler room that's now going for $1,300/mo. Seeing how far that same rent money goes here in Syracuse brought tears of joy to my eyes. 

3) The restaurants. I've been surprised how diverse the options are in this town-- authentic Chinese (esp. Sichuan), Korean, Vietnamese, Polish... even a place that specializes in Filipino lumpyas (even better: its name is an awkward pun, which is the best kind of pun). And there is fantastic pizza all over town, esp. compared to Boston and DC, where great pizza needs to be sought out by word-of-mouth since 80% of the slice joints are strictly for the massively stoned and aren't worth the calories. I love the CNY Regional Market too.

4) The absence of traffic, and all the time that saves. I used to commute down I-95 from Bmore to DC for work twice a week. ""Traffic"" in Syracuse? Don't even start with me, man. 

5) The people. Every other dude here looks like a tatted up, Crossfit-hardened viking or ex-Marine, and yet practically everyone--those dudes included, maybe even those dudes especially--is really friendly. And the Canadian-ish accents are profoundly charming. 

6) The summertime weather. I've heard it's been a wet couple months, but the rain rarely seems to linger; it just passes through to cool things off. And it never seems to get DC hot (unbearable) or even Boston hot (near-unbearable), which means I can hike all day without feeling like I have wet, smoldering Levis wrapped around my face the whole time (which is what the air in the DC area feels like in the summer). 

7) Ithaca. I know it's an hour away, but the gorges down there are so awesome--and so relatively close to Syracuse--that the town is worthy of its own separate mention.

8) Americana. If you love classic American culture--diners, soft-serve ice cream, great pizza (again), thrift shops, etc.--Syracuse is really a delight. The architecture is great too, and seems kind of underrated (like so much else here). 

9) Proximity to Canada. Cos you never know when we'll need to throw open the ol' ""escape hatch.""

Snowmobiling – The Tug Hill plateau offers an excellent spot for snowmobiling due to the abundance of snow it receives

Adult sports leagues – several local sports leagues [here](http://www.syracusesportsassociation.com/) in addition to other independently run leagues

Disc Golf - Several courses in the area including Green Lakes State Park, Jamesville Beach, Heritage Park, Clay Central Park

Fishing - There is an excellent amount of fishing in the area. Plenty of great trout streams, in addition to fishing in Onondaga and Oneida Lakes for warmwater species. Salmon River is also a quick 45 minute drive, and only a few hours of driving will get you to the Adirondacks or to the Delaware River and tributaries. The county has a great website that covers most of the fishing opportunities [here](http://www.fishonondagacounty.com/)."

Moved back to DC for work this summer and am sorely missing my favorite Syracuse restaurants, many of which have no equal down here. 


Without further ado, and in no particular order, here are the Best Things I Ate in Syracuse, 2017-2018:


21 Cafe
Dish: dry-pot stir fry (""Pick-Cook"")
This is my favorite restaurant in the western hemisphere. Some nights I fall asleep thinking about this place. 


Eve's European Sweets
Dish(es): Homemade vegetable soup (offered as a special); pierogis; mushroom croquettes; carrot salad
Just got back from a trip to Krakow and Warsaw, and Eve's is still the best Polish restaurant I've ever been to. 


Doug's Fish Fry in Cortland
Dish: Fried fish platter
The Cortland location is the best fish-fry I've ever been to, period. 


Spoon &amp; Chopsticks
Dish: Spicy Seafood Ramen
Outstanding new Korean place; best spicy ramen I've ever had.


Old Chengdu
Dish: ""Grill roast fish"" with striped bass
An exciting special-occasion dish to split between two or three people ($48): striped bass fried and then baked in a huge metal tray with vegetables and spicy/numbing chili oil. Epic!


Gangnam Style
Dish: Jjampong 
A classic mom-and-pop cafe. The ""dry"" seafood noodles are also great here. The nice lady who runs the front of the house loves their jjampong, and I can certainly see why.


Mario and Salvo's
Dish: Cheese pizza
Most DC residents (myself included) would kill for a NY-style pizza place this good. 


Nick's Pizza
Dish: Cheese pizza
Not as well-known as Syracuse's other pizza titans, but really an outstanding pizza, just a notch below Mario &amp; Salvo's in my book (in other words, just a notch below Valhalla itself). 


Thai Love NY
Dish: Drunken noodles; fried rice; ginger tea; pad thai; salmon house-special
Just about everything you could want in a cute-neighborhood-Thai-place. Lovely and relaxing atmosphere; flawless food; consistent quality even when the place is packed. 


Tous Les Jours
Dish: ""plain"" milk tea bubble tea and milk tea latte
They have TLJ in many cities (including the DC area), but the TLJ on Erie Blvd makes their milk tea differently-- it's much better than any others I've been to. 


Francesca's
Dish: calamari appetizer 
Fried calamari for the ages (and a portion large enough to stand alone as a dinner)


Alto Cinco
Dish: Fried catfish 
Addictive cornmeal breading, not a hint of grease 


Asian Cafe (Fayetteville)
Dish: anything with noodles
Newly-opened place with fine homemade, hand-pulled noodles and authentic Lanzhou-style soup. 


Freedom of Espresso (Fayetteville)
Dish: muffins (blueberry or pumpkin)
The best muffins I've had-- actually, the only ones I've ever liked. 


Apizza Regionale
Dish: Pizza margherita 
Yet another world-class pizza option in this city. 

Pavone's
Dish: pizza!
Honestly getting tired of listing pizzas, but it's undeniably a very good city for pizzas. 

Columbus Baking Co.
Dish: Bread, of course
I had to stop coming here cos I would just eat the entire loaf immediately. 


The Stoop Bakery Cafe
Dish: cheese danishes
Real French pastries by a French-trained master baker. The cheese danish is my favorite. 



I'd love to hear your picks-- what are the best dishes you ate in Syracuse this year?


P.S.-- Thank you for a great year, Syracuse!!

There seems to be a lack of understanding about the differences between an intentional murder, negligence, ( which also doesn’t seem to be applicable here) and an accident - lacking liability and culpable conduct.  

I don’t think I need to spell out that it wasn’t an ovation to support the death of a member of the community- I think common sense can fill the rest in.

I am a part of group of students at the University of ESF currently performing a research task oriented around our wonderful lake of Onondaga. We are aware of the negative connotation that the lake's name brings about, having done research regarding the history of the pollution, as well as where it stands at the given moment.  
However, we would still wish to try our bests to start a new conversation of the lake, in terms of where is stands now, and how it has improved in recent times.   
After the years of removal of the pollution, we have seen a huge growth in the diversity of species of fish, as well as aquatic plants, and with them many of the terrestrial animals that rely on the aquatic aspect of this environment have been able to return and flourish once again, I mean, anyone who passes by Destiny USA can easily see the large group of bald eagles of whom take residence in the trees overlooking the lake.  
A big part of this post is trying to open this topic up to the public, and trying to see any viewpoints regarding the lake any of you who read this post have regarding the lake. I, alongside other members of our group will be in the comments of this post actively, and we will post other elements of our project in the comments for any who may wish to follow along in this conversation."

My grandfather was in the armored invasion of Okinawa and brought home a Japanese officers sword. Some time around 1992-1993 a ""family member"" sold it for $50 bucks. 

For years I've thought about that sword as I have nothing left to remember the greatest man I've ever known.  My grandparents raised me because neither of my parents are worth a damn.  My grandfather was the most kind and loving man in my life. He would often tell me the story of that sword and other adventures in WW II. I idolized that man. 

His death destroyed my world. When my grandmother was put into a home the rest of the ""family"" ransacked their belongings. I found out a few years later that the sword was sold to a dealer in antique military memorabilia. The business at the time was either on Hiawatha or Wolf street. If anyone has any information about the business or anything to possibly help me track down that sword, I would be forever grateful.

Or some advice re: poor roof installation,27,47,2020-04-13 11:42:23,"I’m gonna keep this as short as I can even though it’s a very long story. My husband and I got our roof redone last summer. We had a couple leaks here and there that we knew about and the roof was nearly 30 years old, so obviously we just hired the guys to strip down to the plywood and put on a whole new roof. After, the spots that were leaking still are and we actually have new leaks. Roofing owner comes out multiple times to tell me the only issue is I’ve got ice build up, which causes leaks (which didn’t ever make sense to me because we had leaks way before freezing weather). Conveniently, ice damming is the only thing not covered under warranty. My bathroom contractors (separate people) checked out the roof and found a few different issues that point to shoddy installation. Went back and forth many times with roofer, but he stands his ground even though he can’t provide any picture evidence. Also he wasn’t present the day his guys redid my roof, so he really can’t speak to what’s going on under the shingles or if the installation was done properly. 

So we finally got another roofer out to take a look without telling him what my contractors or the roofer believe is the problem (we wanted an unbiased opinion). He found all the issues that my contractors said the roofer did incorrectly. He took pictures and will be sending me a report of his findings along with a quote to fix the roof. 

Due to the leaks after the re-roof, we have a ton of damage inside our house that needs to be fixed. We also have to fix the roof again, after paying $15k to get it fixed initially. Should not have leaks with a brand new roof.

Does anyone know a good lawyer for something like this? Do I have a case here? Is it worth it to hire a lawyer for this to recoup some costs? I have photos of damage inside the house as well as texts of my conversations with the roofer. Also will have photos soon of the improper roof installation from the other guy that came out. 

Thanks everyone for reading."
g3azjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Syracuse/comments/g3azjr/are_people_locally_forgetting_purposefully/,"Are people locally forgetting, purposefully ignoring or unaware of the guidelines for COVID?",20,85,2020-04-17 14:32:01,"I went to a grocery store for the first time in over a month yesterday.  Typically my wife has been doing the grocery shopping (2 week gap between trips, minimum), but she's been busy with work, so I volunteered this time around. Overall, people were being good, but I was amazed at some of the outliers I saw.  
  I couldn't believe the number of maskless people.  We've known for at least a week that masks likely help stop the spread.   It's about protecting others, not yourself.  Knowing this info and not wearing one is selfish.  If you don't have a mask, improvise.  It's CNY, we all have some type of face covering to get us through winter- a scarf, balaclava, neck warmer, doo rag, etc.  (I rocked a balaclava that turns into a neck warmer on the bottom half, nice &amp; thick over mouth, stayed in place and worked great)  Anything to catch those droplets helps.   The variety of people doing this amazed me- little old ladies, college students in Crocs (two unfortunate outfit choices), middle aged women that looked like they just left the hair salon and my favorite, the guy with three kids in tow (they were old enough to have been able to stay in the car safely).  
     
  Which brings me to the 2nd no no I saw a lot of- travelling in groups.  Roughly 30% of shoppers were in groups of 2 or more.  The suggestion for a while has been that one person should go at a time, no need for those extra bodies to be there.    It's just that many less bodies in a space, breathing, spreading droplets/viruses, etc.  You're entire family does not need to go pick out bananas.  Make a list, get what's needed and GTFO.  
  
  And of course, the one item that no matter how many times it been said, some people still ignore- stay 6ft. apart.  This was somewhat unavoidable as the store was very busy despite there being a regulated line, but it didn't seem like people were really making an effort.  Actually maskless guy and his kids all came less than a foot from me, one just about bumped into me.  A lot of people were making an effort, even going as far as not passing each other in the aisle, but again many made no efforts at all (including those not in masks). 

I'm glad to hear that masks and distancing are now law or at least loosely enforced regulation, too bad it has to come to this.  Totalitarian nanny states would be completely irrelevant if people were smart and considerate enough to do the right thing on their own.  BTW, I'm not calling what we're in right  now a totalitarian nanny state, but we're justifiably trending that way.
   So what's the deal?  I just can't wrap my head around the mindest of those that can't take a few simple steps to make everyone safer, I guess I naively assumed people could/would do this and was really taken aback at some of what I saw (again,most people were doing a good job).   
  
  Do people not think the threat is real?  Do they assume that because they feel fine they are not in danger of spreading this?  Do they just forget/fun on auto-pilot and can't deviate from their normal way of doing things?  Do those not in high risks groups not care?    Is there something else I'm missing here?"

Where are the independent bookstores, or the arts and crafts stores, or the coffee shops (we know of three so far, which seems awfully low for a fairly large city / metro area) - are there any good bakeries, or independent comic book stores that carry more than the big titles, etc. And we're not mall-going people (sorry, Destiny USA, I hardly knew ye)

I spoke with the contact tracer, commenced isolation, and then quarantine immediately, and abided all the rules that were sent to me via the email. I was told I would be contacted by the health department, and no one ever contacted me.

I had other questions about my situation, such as whether I was supposed to be in isolation for 10 days, or quarantine for 14 as I got mixed messages from what was said and what was sent via writing. I tried contacting the health department multiple times. I called during office hours. I left multiple messages. No one ever got back to me.

I erred on the side of caution and have been pretty much isolated for 14 days. I have not left my house except to get a test (negative) and have been doing my full part to make sure no one else was exposed on my account. This is incredibly frustrating to navigate when you cannot have simple questions answered by you county. I've read the CDC guidelines and website FAQs and they didn't answer questions specific to my case.

The part that really pisses me off, is that every link they have sent to me has reached a 404 error or not found. In order to finish quarantine, you have to submit a release request and the links they provided in their email, as well as the links you can google to get to are fucking null. This isn't a site down for maintenance thing, I've been trying the links for 2 weeks! I finally reached someone tonight on the on call line, who told me a provider would call me back. They did and left a barely coherent message basically saying the normal people would be back in the office tomorrow. Wonderful. The people who don't EVER answer the line and don't EVER return phone calls are the only ones I can try to reach out to. 

I've been stuck in one room for 14 god damn days and I want to leave my house and resume my life. I am trying to go by the book but right now it feels like I'm lost in the competencies of Onondaga County and their antiquated technological skills.I want to go somewhere tomorrow but will have to face the potential legal consequences of ""breaking"" quarantine.

Earlier today I was walking into Wegmans and was stopped by two early 20s guys in a car saying “Want a home theater?”. Embarrassingly, I only walked over with caution because it felt like those filmed tiktoks where people hand stuff out. 

The driver gets out and opens his hatch to about 5 home theater speaker set ups in their boxes still. He tells me this story of how him and his friend work for JBL (no retail stores anywhere near here) and they “took stock” from the store and are giving them out for a good deal without the boss’ knowledge. 

I knew it was a scam because he showed me the box that said they’re worth $2,400 and said he’d offer it to me for $600 and then $100 when I said I couldn’t. Also I have some knowledge of speaker systems and a brand new home theater set up shouldn’t run you more than $1000 at its highest quality. 

That’s all, just thought I’d let the community know of these guys. Strange to see something like this in Fayetteville area."

All jokes aside, I am really from Syracuse, Sicily (born and raised) but I moved to California 7 years ago. I don't like California at all, it's been a nightmare. Everything is extremely expensive, starting from schools to lifestyle in general. It's really not the place for me. People are also so fake, I'm Sicilian and I've been unable to make friends here. Every time I go to New York is a whole different story, but I can't actually afford to live in the Big City.

I saw on Instagram various profiles that promote Syracuse, NY and the city doesn't look so bad. Many buildings are actually similar to the ones you would find in Sicily, and in general the city looks more European than American. I fell in love with the city, but I have to admit that I've only watched YouTube videos, read articles about it, and so on. I've never been there to see the city, I was going to but then COVID-19 hit.

I'm one of those people who would love to buy one of those cheap old houses and renew it. I saw many cute victorian homes. It's like living a doll house. I love them all!Now, my question is: is Syracuse a bad city? Is it safe? How's your life in Syracuse? Can a woman walk by herself in Syracuse? I know it seems a silly question, but it's not. I live in Hayward, CA, and I CANNOT walk by myself.

Just to give you some background I'm a 30 years old female, I'm married (no kids, not even in the future), and I'm finishing my degree in Criminal Justice. My husband works in IT.

I'd like to know which hoods are good and which are bad. How's the tourism in Syracuse?In brief, I just want to know about the city and how people live their life there.

Thank you in advance! Feel free to contact me in private."

They still have wide availability for these appointments. Several stores have barely had any bookings at all, forcing some redistribution of vaccine to avoid spoilage. It was just announced today though that teachers and childcare workers are also eligible for this distribution at Walgreens, effective immediately. The appointment system online has not been updated to reflect the new eligibility (they are working on this). You can call a store to manually book an appointment in the meantime, or you can simply answer yes to the 65+ question to get around the online check (Walgreens is actually telling people to do this for now). At the store, they will simply have you sign an attestation form that you are eligible and check a box indicating which eligible population you are in."

What are the thoughts on downtown Syracuse condos? Only two I know that go on sale regularly are the ones above blue tusk / landmark theatre. Would love to hear what people think of them- are they ok to good value or nah?

Im a single male that will most likely be single for life so have no reason to buy a house with say good school districts / safer areas. I may be dead wrong but I feel downtown Syracuse has potential and could become hot down the road (think 20-40 years) however yes I feel this is very unlikely but if this happened I’m sure prices would appreciate very well. Would love to hear thoughts about condos.

The only downside I see really is the hoa fees which are quite a ripoff that don’t come with a house. Obv lack of space also exists. I just can’t see past the thought of living downtown where a lot of things happen though vs boring suburbia."

They blast music, blow off fireworks, and I've heard what sounds like gunshots on multiple occasions. They show up all hours of the day and night but most of the time it's only for about 15 minutes before they leave again, which makes sending someone to talk to them basically impossible. I've tried to call the non-emergency police line but they act like I'm inconveniencing them by calling. At one point I called and told them my address but asked that they keep my information confidential as I had been warned by the owner of the graveyard that the people are very violent and have retaliated against people who have called about them in the past. My neighbor also called, and then told me that the police mentioned getting another call that night from my address. So much for keeping my information confidential. I'm at the point where I'm done calling the police because they clearly aren't going to help, but it's still an issue that needs to be dealt with since I've been woken up every night since I've moved in. Has anyone ever filed a formal noise complaint with the city directly? Would it be possible to petition them to put a legitimate barrier around the perimeter of the cemetery to keep these people out when the cemetery is closed? I have no idea what the process is to resolve this situation but I am open to suggestions."

I (24F) am looking for friends/partners in these types of fields. I'd love to get out and create, fix, or renovate. Unfortunately I live in an apartment, so I do not have my own workshop (I am currently painting a bookshelf in my spare bedroom.. that's fun). I would love to learn any new trade/craft. If you need some extra hands with a project, I'm willing to help as long as I learn something! 

A little about myself: I am currently working full time as an ornamental welder/fabricator at a local company. I have access to many tools/equipment/raw material. 4 years experience (and counting) MIG Steel, MIG Aluminum, and a little Steel TIG and Stick. I can read blueprints and know several mathematic formula for fabrication/cut lists (my handy-dandy notebook is full of tips and tricks). I know my way around triangles and circles and can draw/fab creative shapes when accessable to the right machinery. Metal manipulation (torch or by hand with forks). Creative mind and problem solving. I would like to get into carpentry, painting, and know my way around a house and how it functions (plumbing/electric). I am working towards owning a home/workshop, I don't think I could do it on my own, so I may be looking for a far future roommate (I found an *awesome* dream property, but it needs work I'm sure).

At the most I'm looking for a weekend side job, or would just be allowed to sit in and watch/learn. I know many people don't like to share their tools/equipment, so maybe this is a far stretch. Or maybe you are in the same mindset as me, and/or just want someone to talk to about plans/projects. Please feel free to message me if you want to chat! Also, if you know any better place to find people let me know. I'm not a fan of Facebook but if I have to go there that's fine. Have a great weekend!"

Getting them to look at me, say hi, respond to a hi, or even acknowledge my existence was painful. 

A request to those who are out and about...

1) Look up and around. 

2) If you see someone smiling at you, it's okay to smile back.

3) If you see a familiar face - say hi. You aren't asking them to a wedding, you are just saying hi.

4) If someone says hi to you, it's okay to say hi back. Again, not a wedding invite...not signing a contract.

Let's branch out a bit - passing a neighbor's house and see them out front. Beep your horn or wave to say hi. In your front lawn and see a passing by neighbor's car? Wave and say hello.

While this is advice for all over the planet, it is particularly focused on Upstate NY. People in Upstate NY just don't say hi.

Anyway - this area needs to be reminded that we are all in this together. Sometimes a hello/hi can make a difference."

I looked up the list of providers in the area but it's hard to know which ones of them are good or not. I tried Aspen dental but that was a mistake so I'm looking for somewhere else."
