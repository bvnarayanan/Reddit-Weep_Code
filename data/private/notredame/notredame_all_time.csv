I'm entering Notre Dame as part of the class of 2021, and although I think I chose the right school, I've been getting pretty anxious lately. More than anything, I'm anxious about the completely random roommate and dorm assignments. Whereas most of my friends already know where they'll be living next year and they either know with whom they'll be living or at least that their roommate was picked according to similar characteristics, I'm still waiting to be assigned a dorm and a random roommate.

I really hope it'll force me to branch out and meet new people, but I was wondering how it worked out for those of you who have already gone through this. Were you anxious beforehand? How did you end up liking your roommate and your dorm? Do you have any advice for me as I go through this process or any other aspect of freshman year?"

I got home and put on one of the shirts I bought and it just felt right like it belonged on me, not sure how to explain it. But I am really in love.

This was Notre Dame's worst season since the Charlie Weis 2007 (3-9).  It was also Brian Kelly's 2nd losing season in his 26 years of coaching.  Needless to say, he is on the hot seat.  But apparently fundraisers was the reason for the losing ways :/.  Let's just hope we don't make him fundraise anymore.    

Overall  I thought this was a very disappointing season.  Not only terrible play on the field, but we were also plagued with injuries, mostly on defense.

We are starting off the season unranked and we have a big position to fill at QB.  Made a lot of personnel changes but the big ones are at DC and OC.  I think this might be a last ditch effort for Brian Kelly, and I hope it works out.  I do like him as a coach but not when he blames his players for everything (NC State game especially).

Team | Date | My Optimistic Predictions
----|----|-------------------------
Temple | 9/2 | W Should be an easy win
at No. 15 Georgia | 9/9 | W Very optimistic, but I feel like Georgia is overrated every year
at Boston College | 9/16 | W Should be an easy win
at Michigan State | 9/23 | W I'm only giving us the win because I said this was my optimistic prediction. Should be a close one
Miami (OH) | 9/30 | W Should be an easy win
at North Carolina | 10/7 | W I want this to be a blow out, but somehow it will be a close game
No. 4 USC | 10/21 | L Don't really see us beating USC this year, after their fantastic season last year. Unless the bye week beforehand really helps us out
NC State | 10/28 | W I thought we were the better team last year and we will be looking for revenge
Wake Forest | 11/4 | W Should be an easy win
at No. 18 Miami | 11/11 | L I think they are very beatable, but since I already was optimistic against Georgia, I don't think I could use another pick
Navy | 11/18 | W I think we will bounce back after last year
at No. 14 Stanford | 11/25 | L Going into Stanford is going to be very tough
 |  | 
 | Wins | Losses
Result | 9 | 3    

As you can tell from my results, I am fairly optimistic going into this season.  I feel like that's how most Irish fans are haha.  But with a 15 returning starts (8 Offense, 7 Defense) I have a lot of hope.    

On offense I am expecting Equanimeous St. Brown (WR) to have a fantastic year. Along with Josh Adams (RB) and SJ Sanders (RB).  They were a great duo last year and will only be looking to improve.  The biggest person to watch is obviously Brandon Wimbush (QB) who will be looking to make his first start.  He has a lot of talent and hype, but starting as a freshman is never easy.   


On defense it is all about the returning starters.  Our backfield was atrocious, mostly due to injuries and players getting kicked off the team.  We are returning 2 starting safetys and one starting CB so I am hopeful.    


Well I think that's about it, sorry if this became too opinionated but I mostly made it this way to make it open for discussion.  Let's hope for a great season.

Yesterday morning, this e-mail was sent out, in which Affleck-Graves asks that the current students and faculty fill out a survey asking for our thoughts on a potential parking garage, apparently on the site of the current Legend's. This would be a rather big deal, so I've copied the text of the e-mail below. The emphases are mine.

""Dear Students, 

Last February, I shared the  Parking Committee’s recommendations with the University community. The Parking Committee, comprised of undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, and staff, developed recommendations that addressed surface lot parking, the campus shuttle system, reserved parking, and a parking garage. Over the past year, the University has begun to implement many of the recommendations, including making enhancements to the Notre Dame Shuttle.  

The next step in implementing the Parking Committee’s recommendations is to **explore the feasibility of a parking garage**, and share the findings with the University community. Over the next few months, the University will conduct a study of how campus would use a parking garage and what the associated costs would be for those who use it. A critical piece of this study is a survey that is administered by the Office of Strategic Planning and Institutional Research.  

We would like to hear your thoughts on how and when you would use a parking garage. Your feedback is vital.

In response to the Parking Committee’s request last year for feedback on reserved parking, some members of the Notre Dame community shared that they were interested in having covered parking as close to the center of campus as possible. With the opening of several new facilities on the south side of campus, the area in greatest demand for parking is the south side of campus. **If a parking garage were to be constructed, we believe it would be built on the site where Legends restaurant is currently located. At this time there are no plans to close Legends, and if there are any changes we will assist Legends staff with any transition.**

Since parking garages are much more expensive to build and maintain than surface parking, **those who use the parking garage would cover the associated costs**. The University would seek to break even. We expect that there would be rates for hourly, daily, and special event parking for faculty, staff, students, and visitors. In addition, annual reserved parking passes would likely be available to faculty, staff, and students. The rates would be inversely correlated with the expected number of people who would use the garage. Parking fees paid by those coming for special events, such as athletic events, would cover some of the associated costs. Please keep in mind the parking garage would only be built if there are enough faculty, staff, and students who are interested in utilizing the parking garage. We need to hear from you. 

I will share the results of the study with the University community toward the end of this semester. Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts.  

 In Notre Dame, 

John Affleck-Graves

Notre Dame has the best academics and career placement of any of my options (hoping to transfer into Mendoza), so I'm trying to convince myself to lock in. 

The only issue is, there are several key things about ND I just don't like. I'm excited for the cold, but as a backpacking/landscape photography enthusiast the environment seems like a huge drag. I'm white, but not religious at all (though by no-means opposed except social beliefs). I'm in shape, but not a fan of sports. I'm really opposed to all of the harsh drug-rules and parietals, and South Bend doesn't offer many benefits of a big city either. The social life seems off in a lot of ways. These are all pretty big red flags imo, but I'm still optimistic that I can get over them. I hear everyone talk about how important fit is, and I have to wonder where that line is really drawn. By many metrics I don't fit at Notre Dame, but still feel convinced I'll adapt to everything, or at least get through four years for the long term benefits. 

Is that a bad mindset to have? Of course there are a great many things I love about the school too- the size is perfect, the campus was beautiful when I visited, and the academic freedom along with the amazing people that attend are both huge draws- it's just that most ND kids seem to adore the school, or at least seem on board with most of the trademarks. Did any of y'all experience ""getting used to"" campus life coming from a non-enthused position? Was it worth it? Would you change anything? I understand I can find my people anywhere , but is it worth it to work so much harder (or change) at ND?"

I always delete them without reading, as I know student's health insurance is crap, but this time I read it and IMO it is outrageous. Why is no one speaking about this?  


FROM  insurancequestions@nd.edu

 The Aetna Student Health Plan for the 19-20 academic year has a few changes this year.  After careful review and discussion, the Student Health Insurance Advisory Committee (SHIAC) has decided to implement four modifications to the plan.  The change and reason behind the change are listed below.  Please know I will be happy to discuss these changes with you.  I am scheduled to present at the GSU meeting on November 21 at 6:30 PM.    


The 2019-20 renewal rate of $2,555, a 12.8% increase over last year’s premium, reflects a large increase in high-cost pharmacy and medical services incurred by enrollees in 2018-19.  To help reduce the renewal rate, which Aetna originally proposed as a 24.8% increase, we prioritized plan changes that will enhance students’ ability both to make informed decisions about their health and to become more active, engaged participants in the health care system.  The plan design changes for 2019-20 are:

1. $100 ER co-pay

How will this help?  ERs maintain wide range of services and facilities to manage all types of patients, including those with life-threatening conditions.  The cost of being ready for any emergency is passed on, in part, to all ER patients.  An ER co-pay can motivate enrollees to use less expensive options, like UHS or MedPoint24 Urgent Care, for non-emergency conditions.

2. $1,000 out-of-network deductible

How will this help?  Aetna Student Health discounts negotiates reduced charges for services provided in its network.  This means that the same services provided out-of-network will cost more.  Aetna’s large network ensures that our patients can get the care they need at the lowest possible cost.  A higher out-of-network deductible is expected to motivate enrollees to get their care in-network where it is less expensive. 

3. McDonald Physical Therapy deductible waiver eliminated

How will this help?  Making physical therapy subject to the deductible is expected to motivate patients to use their customized Home Exercise Plans from McDonald PT and reduce unnecessary sessions. 

4. Mandatory generic prescriptions required

How will this help?  High-cost brand-name medications continue to be a top reason for the overall increased costs for our insurance plan.  This is also the case across the country.  Choosing a generic medication where one exists can help to keep pharmacy costs as low as possible."

I love both schools, but I aware that Notre Dame is ranked significantly higher (#15). Both schools have amazing school spirit and academics, but UVA has a much better location and south bend is known to have horrible weather (which seems pretty trivial, but I'm going to be spending the next four years there, so I want to thoroughly take that into consideration). I've even heard some ND students and alum say they would've chosen a different school if they had known how terribly cold it is in south bend beforehand, which makes me nervous. Both schools aren't extremely diverse (I'm African-American), so that isn't really a factor, but I know Notre Dame is pretty religious and I'm not a practicing catholic. Both schools will also cost roughly the same. I'd appreciate any advice on where I should go. I guess the biggest con for me with ND is the location. If anyone could enlighten me on what it's like to be in south bend or just in the midwest in general, that'd be helpful. I know I'll be happy at either school in the end, so I'm low-key debating just flipping a coin at this point...

However, I really do think the concept has lost its appeal and quality.

I think having a committee of students working on the project for the entire year leads to too many people wanting to get their ideas or themes on the shirt, and the product suffers. The Shirts of late are overcrowded with too many things going on, and the ""tradition"" of the ever-changing color scheme helps contribute to the stadium's consistent un-unified look, making it easier for teams with unified colors to pop out and ""take over the stadium"" (Anyone remember the Georgia game?). I do understand that Notre Dame does have many color schemes but the point still stands.

I think a much better direction the University could go is having students submit ideas for The Shirt and other students vote on those ideas rather than having an entire committee work on it. That way the entire fanbase will have an input, and it won't lead to constant years of disappointment when The Shirt is revealed and none of the underlying problems have changed like those in The Shirt this year.

This may just be my experience, but a majority of my fellow upperclassmen I've talked to did not get the shirt last year and are not planning on buying the one this year as well. The University stepped in after the Catholics vs Convicts shirt fiasco and created this program, but the current setup is limiting what our potential could be. Instead of having to dedicate countless hours debating with a committee, let individuals work on shirt designs themselves and we can get back to quality designs."

Here is a little workaround through InsideND that we found to see final grades before they are officially released. Follow these steps in order (this only works on a computer):

1) Go to **InsideND**

2) Select **Final Grades (Available May 12)** and click **Start**

3) Click on the second tab at the top of the page entitled **Current Students**

4) Under the **Mobile Grades and Course Schedule** subheading, click on the **Course Schedule and Grades** hyperlink

5) Now click on the **Students** dropdown at the top of the page

6) Scroll down on the PDF and select **Academics**

7) Scroll down one more time and select **Grades**

You will now be able to view your final grades for the classes for which your teacher has already submitted them. Keep in mind that the professors still have the entirety of today to get these grades uploaded, so it is possible that some of your classes will be blank with no final grade at this point.

In my head, I am trying to figure out how much of people’s ND experience is based on their own actions and how much is it school’s traits itself. Ultimately, I like to think that your beliefs manifest in your actions and thoughts, meaning I will have an amazing college experience if I believe I will and do the things to make that belief a reality (be social, build relationships, join clubs of interest, take risks).

We have missed your physical presence on campus, and we are truly excited to welcome you back. As Father Jenkins has emphasized, we believe in the educational value of the on-campus experience for all our students. Reopening campus will require adaptations and sacrifices from all of us — students, faculty, and staff. He outlined a set of health and safety practices designed to minimize the possibility of COVID-19 infection for all, and especially to avoid exposure for those among us who are most vulnerable to severe illness. He also shared a new University travel policy, which indicates University-related travel will be strictly limited to essential travel and expects personal travel to be avoided except in exceptional circumstances (e.g., sick family members). Every member of our community must adhere to these practices and policies so we can remain here on campus and together this fall. 

Please note we are proceeding with caution with our return to campus, and beginning conservatively in terms of modifications to facilities, programs, and services. The safety of you, our faculty, and our staff is our top priority, and what scientists know about transmission of the virus continues to evolve. We will continually monitor the effectiveness and necessity of our protocols, which were formulated based on guidance from the CDC, infectious disease specialists at the Cleveland Clinic, and local health officials. We will add additional measures if needed based on the best available medical advice. On the other hand, if we can safely relax some guidelines over time, we will do so. Thank you for your patience and your commitment to honoring these expectations, some of which will require us to adjust or postpone beloved campus traditions. However, just as drive-by events or virtual sing-alongs have emerged nationwide, I have every confidence you will bring creativity and ingenuity to the ways you connect with one another and make campus life vibrant. We are eager to collaborate with you to create these opportunities. 


Returning to Campus and Welcoming New Students


In partnership with local public health officials, students and families will arrive in the South Bend area in stages. Residence hall staff will arrive on campus beginning Sunday, July 26 for training. International students should plan to arrive Saturday, Aug. 1 to participate in orientation with Notre Dame International. The University’s Welcome program for new graduate students will be Monday, Aug. 3 and Tuesday, Aug. 4. New students in our professional programs will receive guidance about orientation programs from their schools.

Based on public health considerations related to move-in staging and gathering size, we currently anticipate offering two Welcome programs for new first year or transfer undergraduate students and families. Those students living on campus will move in either Monday, Aug. 3 or Wednesday, Aug. 5 based on their assigned residence hall. Each student can be accompanied by no more than two family members or guests. Appointment times will be staggered to facilitate physical distancing. Students and their families can expect the same Welcome Week experience regardless of their move-in date. Following the conclusion of each Welcome program on Tuesday, Aug. 4 or Thursday, Aug. 6, student-only programming will continue through the start of classes. First year assignments are currently planned for release on Friday, July 10. I will write new undergraduate students and their parents with further details about Welcome Week in early July.

Most returning undergraduate students living on campus will move in Aug. 6, 7, 8, or 9. Returning students will have the option to select a move-in day and time using the same appointment system used for move-out during a selection period from July 6 to 13. Any students who do not select a move-in appointment during that period will have a move-in day and time assigned automatically. A very limited number of returning student leaders, international students, and student-athletes will be contacted by relevant University departments for permission to move in Aug. 1 or 2. Because the University must restrict the number of students moving in each day for public health reasons, we will be unable to accommodate individual requests for arrival on Aug. 1 or 2. Each student can be accompanied by no more than two family members or guests. Like move-out, appointment times will be staggered to facilitate physical distancing.


Living, Eating, and Praying in Community


Whether you live on campus or off, please continue to wash your hands or sanitize frequently, wear your mask when around others and practice physical distancing. These practices not only protect you, but they protect your peers, faculty, rectors, building services and dining hall staff, advisors, our South Bend and Mishawaka neighbors, and others from infection. They are also essential to minimize the number of people who would need to be quarantined in the case of infection. All students will receive a welcome back package that includes a refillable hand disinfectant or sanitizer, thermometer, and at least three masks, though we also encourage you to bring extra supplies with you to campus. Additional information regarding distribution of these welcome back packages is forthcoming.

Our undergraduate residence halls will operate at standard occupancy, though significantly enhanced cleaning and other adjustments in our common life will be necessary to keep one another safe. While we are still finalizing several details, I can share our current plans. Building Services will now clean the halls seven days a week instead of five, and disinfect high touch surfaces multiple times a day. Assigned roommates will be considered a “household” for purposes of contact tracing. Students will not need to wear masks when they are in their assigned rooms, but they must wear masks in all other rooms and common spaces, including hallways and lounges. While non-resident students may visit friends in the residence halls, these guests must wear masks and observe physical distancing at all times and in all spaces. Hall lounge capacities will be adjusted for physical distancing. No guests may stay overnight in the halls. We hope to make shared kitchens and perhaps hall fitness rooms available through appointments or limited hours, dependent on sufficient cleaning, disinfecting, and spacing. Food sales, unfortunately, cannot be offered safely this semester, though those kitchens may be open for individual use by appointment. Residence hall laundry facilities will be free this fall as planned. Finally, our facilities team is looking into possible ways to manage temperatures inside halls that are not air-conditioned.

We believe if students follow these protocols the residence halls will be safe and healthy environments. Due in part to the cancellation of our study abroad programs, there will be alternative living arrangements available this academic year, and we will do all we can to assist those students interested in exploring these options. Pangborn Hall and Fischer Graduate Residences will now be open to undergraduates, and the safety and health protocols outlined above will apply to these residences as well. Students may also choose to move off campus this fall without incurring a housing contract penalty and still earn credit toward the residency requirement. Please contact the Office of Residential Life by Wednesday, July 1 if you would like to explore alternative on-campus and off-campus options.  

Our partners in Campus Dining are adjusting their facilities and offerings in accordance with best industry food service practices. Retail outlets have revised menus to reflect Grab and Go or individually plated carryout food only. Food orders from these outlets may be placed in advance through the Grubhub app and are available for pick up. Dining halls will be available only to those campus community members with purchased meal plans. Disposable serveware will be used, self-service buffets will be replaced with individually portioned, served buffets, and dining capacity will be modified to ensure physical distancing. Outdoor dining will be available in tents on North and South quads and Grab and Go options at both dining halls will also be enhanced. As a reminder, this year we are excited to offer block plans to all students and more flexible on-campus meal plans to upperclassmen. 

Gathering together in faith communities and nurturing the spiritual life of our students remains a crucial priority consonant with our Catholic mission. The Basilica of the Sacred Heart is already open for public Masses and operating consistent with diocesan guidelines. Most daily Masses will be offered in residence halls and academic buildings, though adjusted as needed for physical distancing requirements. We are in the process of exploring alternative on-campus spaces for residence hall and Law School Sunday Masses so these faith communities can continue to worship together at a regular time.


Nurturing Your Health and Well-Being


Our world has changed radically since March. Whether you are a new or returning student, a graduate or undergraduate student, you transitioned to some form of remote instruction and likely paused academic research last spring. While you persevered admirably, this experience was isolating for many and a particular challenge for students who might have less resources available to them. Well over 100,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the United States, with hundreds of thousands more around the world. The economic fallout of the pandemic has impacted the financial situation of many students’ families and created uncertainty related to summer work, internships, and future employment prospects. And, as I wrote, George Floyd’s killing reminded us of the terrible impact of racism in our country.

These are significant challenges, and we want to understand how they have impacted both your mental and physical health. The McDonald Center for Student Well-Being has created a short assessment to understand your impressions of our current environment, explore how the last few months have affected you, and identify the areas you most need help this fall. Please complete this confidential survey, ideally no later than Wednesday, July 1. The results of this survey will help the University plan the most effective services and programs to support you.

We already have a variety of services in place to nurture our students’ physical and emotional well-being, and we will further enhance them this fall. As Father Jenkins indicated, every member of the University community must complete a daily self-screen. University Health Services (UHS) clinical staff will reach out to you if the results of your health screen indicate you should be assessed and tested for COVID-19. The flu vaccine will also be required of all students this fall to minimize our community’s experience with respiratory-based illness. We are finalizing COVID-19 testing plans for our campus community, but we intend to have convenient, free testing available on campus to all enrolled Notre Dame students, as well as full-time staff and faculty. Both UHS and the University Counseling Center (UCC) will offer their standard comprehensive care through in-person appointments and telehealth or teletherapy options will also be available based on students’ preferences. Within the Center for Student Support &amp; Care, our Care and Wellness Consultants and specialists in Sara Bea Accessibility Services are similarly available in person or virtually for students with complex needs or requests for accommodations.

With the modifications the University has made and dedicated adherence to our public health practices by students and all community members, we believe our campus will be as safe as any other environment, and the risk of acquiring the virus on campus should be very low. Nonetheless, we are prepared to care for students if they become infected with COVID-19 and therefore need to be isolated. We will similarly support students who are considered close contacts of infected individuals and therefore need to be quarantined. Adhering to our health and safety practices, especially regarding mask wearing and physical distancing, is the best way you can minimize the risk that you will become infected or be considered a close contact of an infected individual. 

While off-campus students will likely complete any necessary isolation or quarantine time in their homes, University staff will check in with these patients daily, provide monitoring supplies, and ensure the students have access to a delivery service for groceries, food, and supplies. The University has contracted with three off-campus partners for quarantine or isolation space for on-campus students and has additional apartments reserved for this purpose in a separate building of Fischer Graduate Residences. These students will also be checked on daily, provided with monitoring supplies, and delivered two daily meals prepared by Campus Dining. All isolated or quarantined students will be referred to Sara Bea Accessibility Services for accommodations and classroom support, including monitoring of exams. UHS providers will follow up with students regularly and advise when they are able to return to the classroom. Finally, the University has strong partnerships in place with both local hospitals if a student’s illness becomes severe.

The University, in partnership with local public health officials, will perform contact tracing for any infected student. Our system is intended to allow contact tracers to thoroughly identify all high-risk or close contacts, conduct timely notification of contacts to prevent further transmission, ensure resources are available for appropriate medical evaluation of any contacts who are or become symptomatic, and ensure successful quarantine or isolation of contacts during the potential time frame when they may be infectious.


Enabling Student Formation Through Facilities and Programming


All of the facilities designed for student programs and activities will be open this fall, including the Duncan Student Center, the LaFortune Student Center, Washington Hall, Stepan Center, Rockne Memorial, the basketball courts in the North Dome, the Smith Center for Recreational Sports, and the Ricci Band Building. These facilities will implement enhanced sanitization and disinfection protocols, will modify furniture and adjust capacities to University physical distancing requirements and may reduce operating hours to ensure deeper daily cleaning or accommodate academic classes. 

Given the adjusted timing of the semester and what we have learned about transmission of the virus, we encourage you and all student groups to utilize our outdoor grounds in safe ways as much as possible. All outdoor grounds, including Ricci Fields and the West Quad Fields, can be reserved by student groups and may also be used informally by students when there is no prior reservation. In collaboration with Campus Dining, we intend to offer the tents installed on North and South quads as space that can be reserved for additional outdoor student programs or informal gathering. 

Staff members in our division’s offices and our partners in the Graduate School are eager to meet with students for conversation, pastoral support, and program planning. Following appropriate health practices, we will be open and available to you in person at Campus Ministry, the Center for Student Support and Care, the Family Resource Center, the Gender Relations Center, the Meruelo Family Center for Career Development, Multicultural Student Programs and Services, the McDonald Center for Student Well-Being, the Office of Community Standards, the Office of Student Enrichment, RecSports, Residential Life, Student Activities, Student Media, and the University Bands. We will also offer virtual engagement opportunities with our staff based on the preferences of students. 

All student clubs and organizations will have the opportunity to meet in person in accordance with appropriate University public health practices and amended student club and organization guidelines and protocols. Student groups may also choose to meet virtually. Attendance must be taken at all in-person meetings and events to allow for contact tracing if needed. Given the University’s travel policy, student group travel as well as off-campus events will not be permitted this fall. Similarly, due to limited University visitors, speakers/performers will not be permitted for in-person engagements, though they can be contracted for virtual events. These limitations on travel and visitors will likely limit students who volunteer regularly in our local community and interact with children. We will share more details as plans are finalized. 

We are still developing our plans for student activities that scientists believe hold significant risk for transmission, whether due to the nature of the activity, the proximity of individuals at those events, or the inevitable contact between individuals. As of this writing, we sadly do not anticipate permitting group vocal activities indoors, student dances, or many contact club or intramural sports. We are working hard to research safe ways to enable outdoor choir rehearsals or performances, musical instrument rehearsals and performances, and dance and theater performances, though they will likely require significant restrictions. We know how much students involved in these efforts cherish their experiences and we want to offer them safely if we can. Fitness classes and instructional programs will require adjusted attendance based on physical distancing. For those interhall sports we are able to offer, rosters will be open to both current and former hall residents this year given that some study abroad students may be unable to return to their home residence halls. We are consulting the University’s medical experts, relevant CDC guidelines, and relevant professional association guidelines regularly, and we will publish a full set of student club and organization guidelines and protocols throughout the summer and upon your return. While these changes will present constraints, we look forward to working with you to imagine new ways to enrich our campus life.


Preparing You Well for Fall


This is a lot of information to digest, and I realize some items require significant and sometimes painful changes to ways we interacted on campus prior to the pandemic. I hope you will approach these modifications by remembering that they will allow us to be here safely on campus, learning and connecting with one another in person and at the place we love. Together, I know we can remain healthy, support each other during these challenging times and create new ways to build community. 

While I will write to you periodically this summer, please consult the University’s website regularly for updates as our plans continue to evolve. You can also contact the Office of Student Affairs with questions. We will reply as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your patience as we continue to finalize our preparations for your return.  Finally, Vice President and Associate Provost for Undergraduate Affairs Hugh Page, Vice President, Associate Provost and Dean of the Graduate School Laura Carlson, and I will also be inviting elected undergraduate and graduate student leaders to several virtual meetings between now and the beginning of the semester so we can better understand student questions and concerns and share updates on the University’s plans. 

Let me conclude where I began, which is with sincere excitement for your return to us. We are working tirelessly to prepare for a healthy and fulfilling fall semester. Please know of my prayers for you and your loved ones and stay well this summer.  

In Notre Dame,

Erin Hoffmann Harding
Vice President for Student Affairs"
huhkwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredame/comments/huhkwd/i_used_to_work_at_notre_dame_university_here_is/,I used to work at notre dame university. Here is my experience.,70,14,2020-07-20 01:16:32,"So I worked at Notre Dame from about 2014 to 2019. I worked at North dining hall. First of all they hire less students than outside employees because outside employees are cheaper to higher than students. The students got way better benefits than the rest of us. They also didn't have to do most of the manual labor they were given a very cushy existence while the rest of us got chewed out on a daily basis. The north dining hall that employees experienced versus what students got was way worse and because of this they told us that we were not allowed to talk to the students about anyting. If the students talk to us then we're allowed to talk to them but only about what they asked us about nothing else especially not the job.
It's very rare for them to hire in full-time they usually make you work from part-time to full-time. It's almost as if they want to test before they hire full-time. A good fit for them is someone who just quietly accepts everything and questions nothing.
When I was hired they asked if I had any questions for the hiring manager. I said what is your union policy. He got defensive. We don't allow unions at Notre Dame. I said why. ""He said I suggest you leave your activism at the door.""
I knew a guy in the managers did not like him. The only thing keeping him from being fired was the fact that he was going to HR about the horrible things that the managers in North dining Hall were doing. HR would reach out to the management team they would change nothing and continue on.
They violate labor laws on a daily basis. They only gave us the bare minimum of brake which in Indiana is a half hour break if you work over so many hours and a 15 minute break if you work if you work Less hours. No break if you work even less than that. They were very good about breaks let us take our breaks when we need them until a new manager showed up at North dining hall. He rearranged the way that we take breaks and for days on end we would not know when my brakes were going to be. I explained to him that you get mad when we ask about breaks you tell us that you'll come in and tell us when the brakes are but then you don't allow any of us to take breaks because you never told us when they were. So then the people who got there half hour break and the 15 would take their half hour break at 4:30 I would usually come in at 4. And they were allowed to eat food and everything else which is in the employee handbook. But also people who got a 15 minute break could eat a cold meal. So he made all the 15-minute people go at 8 they take down the Buffet at 7:30pm the only time they don't is on the weekends. The lingo for the student handbook says that we can have a cold meal if we have a 15 minute break you can have one hot meal if you have a half hour break. So they said they can't stop him from putting the break at 8pm. I said everyone's complaining that they don't get a chance to get food and no one's happy about that. Then the HR told me that well we can't do anything about that.
Not long after HR made him give us our breaks. Few months later we stop getting them. I talked to HR and told them that we're not having our breaks again. They said this is getting ridiculous we stopped being involved because we didn't think we needed to anymore. But now they started up again with the BS.
I asked what time brakes would be one night and he got in my face and screen to me and says brakes will be when I tell you and I said but you never tell us so how are we supposed to know when to go on break when you don't tell us. I reached out to HR then there was a change in his management style.
Later I found out that the manager who was causing problems at North dining hall had been at South dining-hall for years. There apparently he was even worse and the manager that's currently over there is worse than him. From what I've heard people saying that they told me they worked at South.
When I asked the HR why they moved him instead of just firing him. They told me that they thought that the new environment would be a good place for him to level out. But in reality he was just making North dining hall be like South dining hall. I explained to them things are getting worse not better. The other managers were at first trying to fight it but he is such an authoritative jerk that they just kind of let him go along and do whatever he wanted. One night one of the other managers told us that we can have a breaks like normal. We're not doing that anymore it's wrong. So we all go on break like normal and then he comes in and screams at us because we have to follow what he says even when he's not closing. He said that if you guys don't follow it then you're not on my side. So basically. When I told HR that they then got it to the point where he could only do that a night that he closed and not every night even when he's not there. He told everybody that he was ex-military but I heard from another manager that he had work in construction before working at Notre Dame.
I remember a situation specifically what we were all scared to you on break when the other manager told us to not at 8 because we were scared of being yelled at by him.
One time I was talking to a co-worker who said that he was upset about something with the management had said I don't remember what he said they said. I said this wouldn't be happening if we had a union. And another co-worker quickly told me don't mention Union the fire you for even mentioning it.
One time I did talk to a student about how the management treats us on a daily basis versus how they treat the students they were very upset. And went and talked to their supervisor and then I was talk to you later and said don't do that.
Then the mean manager. Told students who came in not to trust me because I like to lie to students. Meaning that he knew what I said was the truth. And they were doing anything and everything they could to suppress when I had said.
The only thing keeping me employed was the fact that I was going to HR and actively fighting them. Towards the end of my stay in 2020 I decided to stop fighting because I was getting tired of having to fight. Then I guess they told HR that everything is hunky-dory even though it wasn't. And then I went back to HR and told them that he was taking away our breaks again. He saw the email on my phone and he told it a co-worker that if I go to HR with my lies again that he would be the one fired. Two weeks later I'm fired for actually writing down the wrong time on the time in sheet twice. They told me that that was the only reason I was fired but especially when the mean manager was the one who talked to me about it. I really don't think that it was not personal. He definitely wanted me gone to protect his own career.
Another thing is that I have PTSD and BPD at first everything was fine until the mean manager showed up at least about the BPD and PTSD. I went to the mean manager multiple times and told them that I was not getting treatment I deserved off PTSD and BPD. And that was directly this managers fault.
They said they didn't know about my PTSD or BPD and they didn't know that I was receiving alternate treatment at work for it. Basically management just kept it away from HR. So HR didn't have to be involved. They said before I went to HR they thought everything was okay and we're planning on out there is no reason for them to look in to be involved. I realize now that during the period when I stopped fighting through HR that they were again lying to HR saying that everything was okay no complaint means everything is okay. If managers like him exist in more numbers at Notre Dame which sounds like they do. Then people are actively being told not to go to HR or they lose their jobs.
I can also say that the. Where I was not fighting I stopped because the mean manager bullied me into not standing up to him through HR. Basically he bullied me into submission so he wouldn't get fired.
Now let me talk about the head of food service for a moment When I had to work catering over the summer for internal events for the salaried employees award shows. We had to work alongside the head of food service for Notre Dame at the president's dinner.
He yelled at me because a person returned a plate. It was missing green beans they were supposed to have green beans like it said but the plate didn't have green beans. I said that's not my fault. One of your chefs didn't put the green beans on the plate that's why they're not there. I need another plate with green beans so I can give it to the customer. Also the steak on that plate was cold. And it turned out that other people didn't return plates because they were afraid of being yelled at by him. Afraid that they would get in trouble for ""stealing the green beans"" one steak was returned and it was still frozen. The other people just told the customers that they couldn't return it. Which I think is what they told me to but that's not right I'm not going to let that happen. He also tried to get me removed from his wait staff that evening because he didn't want me there ""messing everything up""
and it turned out they put the mean head of food service on the balcony as far away from the president's table as possible so the president wouldn't hear screams coming from the kitchen. I don't know how high up it goes but that's pretty messed up. I asked a co-worker what do you think would happen if I went and told the president who sitting down there about this problem. He said don't talk to me about that you would be fired probably. So to protect my job I didn't.
Also the mean manager at North dining hall. Told anyone that they would be ""fired if they took my side in anything that I was saying. The only reason he's not fired is because he's lying to HR, everything is good here is not"" everyone agreed as to not lose their job.
I didn't.
We were at a meeting between the heads of HR and food service. Not the head chef though I think I was a different meeting. Technically I was a culinary service associate and he was the head of the Food Service for example chefs and cooks.
So he could not touch me. Because we were technically in two different departments.
So I went above the mean manager in North dining hall went to his supervisor. And he said I don't think any of this stuff that you saying about the mean manager is true. Is the nicest sweetest guy I've ever met and I'm not going to lose him because he's a valuable asset. So I was told off by the head of North dining hall to basically f*** off.
There were a lot of bootlickers at Notre Dame who believed that the lies that they were being told were true. That they really valued them as employees.
After being fired I know that is not the case because my last day on the job the management team treated me like I was discardable like I was dirt. And those were the good managers. Because technically I'm not employed there anymore so they don't have to treat me with respect they don't have to do anything. I said this to the manager who's fired me and she said ""you're not employed here anymore so we don't have to do anything in specific way just because you don't like it""
I explained to them that I have PTSD and BPD and that it's not appropriate for you to talk to me like that you can't talk to me like I'm nothing. And she said ""well HR never told us"" we don't think it's true. which is the same line they used Everytime.
When I talked to the person who is in charge of getting the forms in order and all the legal stuff surrounding Mental Health in the workplace. She told me that they're going to have a meeting with the managers and explain everything that I needed. I come back to work on Thursday and nothing was different. I said didn't she come and talk to you guys. I used her name and she turned to the manager next turn said he knows who they are. they said how did you know about the meeting you weren't there that was only for management who told you about that. I showed them the email which I still have. Because I used my personal email instead of my work email. And then she got red in the face and looked at me and said ""they still haven't contacted us about you specifically so we don't have to do anything""
But since I was part time and being kept it part time because none of the management liked me I was not eligible for FMLA. But you had to work over a certain amount of hours to be eligible for which I did not meet.
The only reason they were okay with making accommodations for me is because of the supervisor there who stuck up for me. She took an early retirement deal and retired about a year before I was fired. And it turned out that because she was sticking up for me the mean manager was going to fire her for ""insubordination""
One day I came in to work on an off-day and went to the office and asked if my employee celebration tickets had came in.
The mean manager told me ""you don't work here"" I said things aren't like they were when you are in construction where are people in the work a certain job site for a day and are employed when they're not on the job. Here we actually have employees who are are employed here even on their off days. He yelled why do you think I don't understand that I'm a manager. I said because you were just sitting up in your Ivory Tower saying things that show that you didn't know.
He said he was not in construction before Notre Dame he was in the military and I said I know that's not true stop lying about your military service. He used to be a foreman in construction never had military service. I personally looked into it and couldn't find any evidence that he did. I think he was just using it as a scare tactic to scare people into submission.
Another time when I had to do my personal review. They would always make me a certain managers computer. Another employee came in to do their review and they sat down at the computer next to mine and did it on that computer I said hey be careful the mean manager doesn't want you to use any computer but this one. And she said no you can use any computer doesn't matter. I was told that I had to use that computer specifically.
Later I walked into the office and they got into my account because the mean manager made everybody give them their passwords for ""in case you forget yours"" which sounds well enough.
I saw them on my computer in my account checking my email and said ""there's no emails to HR""
I left and they didn't notice me.
I have a family member who works in HR and the mean manager find out about that and thought that's where I was getting my information from. So he told me that I need to cut ties with my mom so he can feel more comfortable about doing his own job.
But in reality what I was doing is asking other people who work at North dining hall for information and you get enough of you get enough puzzle pieces and you can put the entire puzzle together and see the big picture.

I stand for workers rights you should too. If you have any questions leave them in the comments and I will do my best to answer them."
hvuyfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredame/comments/hvuyfh/the_universitys_statement_on_concerns_about/,The university's statement on concerns about student behavior on and off campus,38,29,2020-07-22 07:40:37,"I received an email today with the below information. Thought I'd share it. There is a lot more information in the email about other topics, so I will [link to the full statement](https://here.nd.edu/news/message-on-reopening-the-university-masks-cru-student-return/) once it goes live on the news section of [here.nd.edu](https://here.nd.edu).

&gt;**Student Return**  
&gt;  
&gt;We know that many of you have expressed concerns about the return of students and their behaviors on and off campus after they arrive and during the semester. What follows is an overview of the steps Erin Hoffmann Harding and the team in Student Affairs are taking to bring students safely back to campus and support them during the fall semester.  
&gt;  
&gt;• As part of the University’s health and safety guidelines for returning to campus, all undergraduate and graduate students are required to undergo pre-matriculation testing. We will ask any student who tests positive not to return to campus until medically cleared to do so.  
&gt;  
&gt;• All new and returning students will be required to complete pre-matriculation modules offering information, education, and bystander intervention skills that will reinforce campus health and safety practices. Students must complete these modules by July 31.  
&gt;  
&gt;• Assistant rectors and resident assistants will move into halls beginning July 26.  
&gt;  
&gt;• Hundreds of student leaders will arrive August 1-2 and will participate in an in-depth training designed to share information about COVID-19 transmission and risks, reinforce campus health and safety practices, help establish new campus norms, and serve as a resource for peers. About 1,300 students will receive this training before classes begin, augmenting the return-to-campus orientation required of all students, faculty, and staff members.  
&gt;  
&gt;• New first-year students and transfer students will move in on either August 3 or August 5.  
&gt;  
&gt;• Students and their families can expect the same Welcome Week experience regardless of their move-in date.  
&gt;  
&gt;• The welcome program for new graduate students will be Monday, August 3 and Tuesday, August 4.  
&gt;  
&gt;• During move-in, students may bring no more than two guests to assist with move-in, and everyone must wear masks, and comply with other campus health and safety protocols. Further details about move-in are available from the Office of Residential Life.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Residential Life*  
&gt;  
&gt;• This fall Notre Dame will operate 33 on-campus residence halls for undergraduate students, including the new, soon-to-open Johnson Family Hall. To accommodate students not taking part in study abroad programs this fall, Pangborn Hall will house women this year, and several undergraduate students (men and women) will live in Fischer Graduate Residences.  
&gt;  
&gt;• We reserved three off-campus housing facilities for students living on campus who require isolation or quarantine, in addition to separate buildings of Fischer Graduate Residences.  
&gt;  
&gt;• Off-campus students will most likely isolate or quarantine in their apartments or homes.  
&gt;  
&gt;• Regardless of location, all students in quarantine and isolation will be monitored daily, provided with supplies, and supported by offices including University Health Services, the COVID-19 Response Unit, and the Center for Student Support and Care.  
&gt;  
&gt;• Per Erin Hoffmann Harding’s June 22 letter, students were able to choose to move off campus this fall without incurring a housing contract penalty and still earn credit toward the University’s six-semester residency requirement. We offered space to all students who applied to live on campus this fall.  
&gt;  
&gt;• Details about hall life can be found and will be updated regularly in the Residence Hall operations section of the University’s website  
&gt;  
&gt;*Student Health and Well-Being*  
&gt;  
&gt;• In addition to its regular primary care and sports medicine services, University Health Services is working in close collaboration with the COVID-19 Response Unit (CRU) on student prematriculation testing, the on-site testing clinic, students’ daily health check, distribution of the flu vaccine (which is required this year for all students), contact tracing, and student quarantine and isolation care.  
&gt;  
&gt;• The University Counseling Center, the McDonald Center for Student Well-Being, and the Center for Student Support and Care have spent the summer reviewing students’ learning accommodation requests and assessing student perceptions and care needs related to COVID-19, mental health, racism, and discrimination in order to offer the most helpful programs and services this fall. Leaders in these units are working closely with the Emotional Support and Wellbeing Working Group.  
&gt;  
&gt;• These departments also plan to expand telehealth and teletherapy offerings to students as the fall semester begins."

&amp;#x200B;

(the following is just me rambling, no demand for being read.)

I know UHS resources and had tried counseling last academic year, and know the general guidelines about keeping healthy ( eat 2-3 meals regularly, vitamins, daily exercise, get social supports, keep a sufficient and stable sleep schedule, the psychological “flow"" state, etc. ) But just want to know how different people deal with it in real life. 

I realized that my emotions were haunting me in late HS and freshment year college, but I was not so sure about the diagnosis, or about how depression (technically bipolar, but mostly just depressed) could affect my college life. It is also recently that I comfirmed that many common suggestions, despite sounding fine, don't really work for me. (Like, they imply that if you take it as a motto and live it, you will improve. But for many of them I just gave up after a few tries. Now I'm more laid back, try to make my personal way of dealing things evolve with time, and the only request for myself is to finish school works and the related, in time, and to have a bit of extracurricular life. ) The semester has started for 2 weeks and I'm already missing HW deadlines, not a good sign. I just hope I can learn from them and have a better state than last week for the remainig semester. I'm kind of working on it rn. Really don't want to have (more precisely, contribute/lead to) a screwed-up semester like the last one. (And even trying to participate in research... hopefully next semester if not this semester)."

I mean earning a bachelors degree in both areas - a total of 2 degrees) in some business major and computer science in the college of engineering.

I’ve already taken 2 AP CS courses and 2 CS dual-enrollment courses with my local community college. If I took intro courses throughout my summers at my local community college (since it’s very inexpensive, otherwise I’d just take summer courses at a University), would earning a bachelors in both fields be doable in 4 years?

I’m aware of the corporate practice minor, and if this turns out to not be possible, I’ll likely try to earn that or apply for their 5 year bachelors of engineering and MBA program.

I mean, I knew people who scheduled flights in September, who left south bend during the online period and those who begged to be allowed to go home (while the university politely said “No” of course). Even they are somehow taking finals this week.

I just want to point out that besides from the annoying sarcasm and inconsistency and seemingly uncaring points of the university, I have been honored to be a part of the student body at this point, watching people come together to help their hurting friends and seeing random strangers offer assistance and care when others run out of energy. 

I wish that could be the case for everyone here, to have support, but that’s obviously not the case. But as I’ve seen many alumni and even some students say, we can make it. It’s gonna hurt even more probably, but I have to believe we can.

It's the best school I've gotten into so far, I love that it's Catholic, and I've loved a lot of what I've learned about it. So it's generally my top choice. But I'm concerned about the low diversity.

For reference, I'm white. So maybe I shouldn't be worrying about this, but I do think it's important. The high school that I go to now is decently diverse, with lots of interaction between people of different races. I don't want to go to college and be surrounded with people who are all just like me. I worry that the environment at Notre Dame will be like that. I worry about its relatively low diversity, and that the atmosphere is unwelcoming to students from minority backgrounds.

So, my question has multiple parts. And really it's probably way too big of a question to be asking in a reddit post. But this is bothering me, so I just wanted to see what this community has to say about it. I wanted to know, is diversity at Notre Dame improving? How bad is it, or just generally what is the vibe like? What can I do- and I know this is a question to research on my own, too, but I figured that you guys know what it's like at Notre Dame and could maybe offer some more Notre Dame-specific insights- but what can I do when I'm there to improve this? To make the community more welcoming? To not be lost in a bubble of people who are just like me? 

Thank you so much to anyone who can provide me with any insight or any of their experiences. I know these are a lot of deep questions. I'm sorry if this comes across as rambling. I really love so much about Notre Dame, but this part has been nagging at me, and makes me wonder if I should've chosen different schools to apply to. I don't know. Thank u all. &lt;3"

-2 girls from the same section in the same dorm were wearing masks and social distancing in a room. They got written up with a covid violation because the door was closed. Now the one student is afraid of entering other people’s rooms out of fear of serious consequences.

-1st covid violation (like above) gives a warning. 2nd puts a person on covid probation. 3rd leads to serious consequences (like getting kicked off of campus) with very little chance to appeal.

-Two weekends ago, around 300 students were partying and dancing on the floor with no distancing at Newfs. As far as I’m aware, no one got punished.

-After an obvious subsequent spike of cases, campus banned in person clubs, all in person activities, and dorm visitation except for classes and masses

-A group chat on campus has developed where people brag about and coordinate writing up/reporting people for covid violations. The first point in this list was bragged about by an RA in this groupchat.

-There are around a dozen black and white posters on library quad containing nothing but Father Jenkins’s portrait.
[The Portrait](https://imgur.com/a/MNeeY3p) 

-Last weekend, around 300 students were running from the cops at Monterrey’s bar and grill described as maskless and “moblike”, invading the kitchen and climbing on the roof. I don’t think the university has addressed this or reprimanded students, but the south bend police say they are working on a report and looking through footage.

-For the last week, Notre Dame students have counted for around 4% of all daily covid cases in Indiana, and 41.5% of all cases in St. Joseph’s county in the last two weeks. Notre Dame students make up around 4.5% of the population of St. Joseph’s county.

-Another friend’s room has been invaded multiple times by RAs looking for people after hearing the friend talk on zoom.

-Freshmen frequently report not having friends and being very lonely.

-It’s really difficult to trust students you don’t know.

-My friend reports that despite being generally socially isolated, she’s never had less privacy before. She lives in one of the very strict female dorms, and the university policy is that for people to be in your room the door has to be open. She can’t go into another person’s room to privately vent or have a conversation because now everyone can hear it.

lttjxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/notredame/comments/lttjxq/to_female_current_and_past_ras/,To female current and past RAs...,47,18,2021-02-27 09:59:13,"I don't mean to generalize, because I know there are female / male RAs that deviate from this, but for a long time now there has been this consensus that women's dorms are stricter than men's. I just want to know the driving reason behind this.

**Why are you so strict compared to male RAs?** For years I always see and hear nothing but complaints from women about their RAs, whereas in men's dorms the RAs are mostly *bros* (who look the other way or give a second chance) when they witness us breaking what they think is an absurd rule for *adults* to be following (like parietals). This dates back to pre-covid, but from reading some recent posts in this sub I think it's just worsened afterwards (with nitpicking and even invasion of privacy in some instances).

If you're a female RA who's *not* like this, I'd be interested to hear your input as well. Why do you think this is part of the dorm culture?"

Last semester was bad enough; no one knowing protocols about quarantine and release, no one knowing testing protocols, and hours of being put on hold or passed around while they scramble for answers to basic questions. 
I learned yesterday that I was unable to change my weekly test day. I moved a few classes around and I have about two hours, not back to back, to take my test, time I wanted to use to eat lunch and dinner. I called them. They told me I was unable to change it but that I could talk to a supervisor to plead my case. I was called today by a person of the same rank who told me that I was unable to make the change and that the supervisors were too busy to talk to me. I told them I was trying to do the best I could to fit testing in with the university and was told, “well then it’s so great that you have an hour!” I understand that I wasn’t going to make a lot of traction with that, but I don’t need UHS to be patronizing and condescending on top of being disorganized."

I am simply sharing my perspective on the situation on campus. 

Listen, I know things are different, and I know this semester hasn't started off quite as we would have preferred, a spike in cases has led to stricter guidelines than we expected, and that sucks. Has the Uni handled this competently? of course not, nothing new there. Do they shoulder the blame for most of the shit kinda hitting the fan on campus currently? Absolutely not. But either way, I'm not writing this to decide who deserves the blame for what, because nobody knows the answer to that question, I'm writing this to answer the question a lot of Alumni have about campus life: Is it that bad?  


The short answer: no. I still get to go to class with my friends every day, relax with them on my off time, and have a good bit on fun on the weekends. Do not get me wrong, *this is indeed the case for MOST ND students* I understand that these restrictions have not affected everybody equally, but, for the most part, having a social life is still completely possible. The fact of the matter is, we have a pretty decent influx of cases (it's not 5% of all the cases in Indiana, like some people who don't know how statistics work would have you believe, but it's really bad).

I have a lot of friends who do not go to Notre Dame and, for the most part, all of their restrictions are around the level of ours or stricter, this certainly is not a Notre Dame only issue. I know it's hard, but I really think it would do a lot of us some good to look on the bright side every once and awhile, we're on campus with our friends, isn't that what's most important?"

And before someone pulls a ""if you knew it was going to be like this, why'd you come here"" or ""I'm not apologizing for upholding Catholic tradition, you just hate Catholicism"", shut the fuck up. I've tried every channel possible, proper and improper. I didn't get a choice in what school to attend, so take your old money privileged bullshit somewhere else.

If they're not going to care, then they shouldn't lie and say they do. And if I want """"""help""'"""" (if you can call it that), I have to add mandatory UCC counseling to my schedule. They don't do anything other than be like ""it's your fault you're not thinking positively enough"". Thanks, I hadn't tried fucking optimism. Should I add tea to that too? Green or rooibios?

Hello, 

I am a student from Canada extremely interested in applying to ND. I was wondering if putting choir as an EC is a good idea. The school I went to is an extremely selective choir school in Toronto - it is one of the highest-ranked schools in Ontario for academics and one of only 6 schools worldwide that is affiliated with the Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music. I had the opportunity to sing around the world including in the Vatican for Pope Francis, Germany and Ottawa. I was planning on writing my common app on my experiences here.

The issue I have is that I left the school and started my middle school career at a private school in a more rural area. I still have connections within the school (part of alumni association, alumni choir), but I feel like ND would just see these experiences as worthless (since they were so long ago). 

1) Would this sound like I am lying? How would I let ND know that I truly went to this school and still have connections with them? Should I include articles and videos of my choir's performance in the additional info section?

2) would this be an acceptable topic to write about? Even though I have not sung that competitively anymore, I am still connected to music at my private school (sectional lead in my band on trombone, music council head). I do also have a few connections with the choir school, but because of covid, I haven't been able to connect as deeply as I wanted to.

Thanks so much for your help, I hope you all have a great week :)"

Pick up a menial job at Notre Dame. Pay is terrible ($4-5 an hour BELOW what the market rate is). You'll constantly be subjected to inane messages about being part of the ""Notre Dame Family"" and be told that your work is ""valued"" but not monetarily... a Catholic university that claims to be so great for South Bend should be paying more than a fast food place or a car wash.


Ive worked at ND landscaping two summers now and never missed a shift. Two weeks ago, I had a severe allergic reaction to a plant at work. My eye swelled up so bad that random people asked me if I needed help. I missed two days of work, but because the office receptionist was on vacation I couldnt get in touch with the office. No one from landscaping called to check on me, but when I did show up to work again they said they were surprised that I had missed a shift because it ""wasn't like me."" 

They told me to talk to Risk Management about the incident because I had to go to the ER and get five days of steroids. I talked to risk management and they told me they would not compensate me because the hospital had designated it as a personal injury even though I told the hospital multiple times it had happened at work and my coworker vouched for me. Convenient for risk management, especially since Iwasnt even able to reach anyone who could have told me that I needed to make sure the ER ""designated"" the injury as work related. Basically, their response was ""Not our problem, thanks to a technicality ""


This morning, there was a thunderstorm outside and I texted my supervisor to ask if we might get sent home from work for rain. I take the bus halfway and walk halfway, and wanted to avoid walking 2 miles in a thunderstorm just to get sent home the opposite way. His response was, ""I don't know, not my problem.""


I'm privileged because I get to leave this job at the end of the summer, but when I see all of NDs promotional messages about the ""Notre Dame family "" I'll know how hollow they are. I've been treated so much better as a student who brings in the $$$$ than as a worker who actually gets shit done. This is outrageous. Notre Dame can and should do better. 

Compensate your people fairly and don't tell me I'm part of the ""family"" unless you actually mean it."

I was just wondering how I stacked to some people who got accepted, as I’m really nervous about applying to be denied. I know there isn’t a clear you’re in or you’re out, especially not something I can ask the students about, but I just want to know how I compare to the people who got in. A little insight into whether or not I may get in from a current attendee would really help me mentally. Thank you very much, potential responders :)"

Several elevators throughout the school


Glorious and clean classrooms\bathrooms\dorms 

Passcodes to unlock doorsand high tech security cameras 
Etc.

My other question may just result in opinions.Here it is lol.

I was out shopping for my mom's last few Christmas gifts and I was wearing my ND sweatshirt (I hope to go there one day)

And this older lady started talking with me about the school,and claimed she was one of the first women allowed to go their in the 70's and got her degree.

I told her that I am hoping to get in to ND myself once I get out of high school,and she told me that it wouldn't be good for a young man like me to do.

She than claimed that the school is now ""ultra community and liberal"" and that it was always very religious and conservative until the last decade or so.

I am pretty socially liberal myself,but I'm not much of a leftist.But I couldn't care less about the political spectrum of most people from the school lol

Our conversation didn't really go much further after that 

But is what she said have truth to it? Women in catholic universities seems like a pretty liberal thing to do back when she was there in my opinion"
