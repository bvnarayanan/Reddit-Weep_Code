I've been admitted with the class of 2021 to the College of Arts &amp; Sciences. I applied for economics, but in reality I'm closer to undecided - my interests are basically a broad cluster around the social sciences. 

I've done the research up and down, and academically Penn just amazes me. I think I might choose PPE, and programs like PIK are pretty interesting. It's also the only school I know of that offers a Behavioural Econ major (even if in Wharton, not CAS). I also know that Penn is actually top 5 in some humanities fields, and not just in business/engg. But at the same time, I've come across some anecdotal (both personal and secondhand) evidence that I... might not love Penn. 

Maybe a heuristic to capture my worries is this https://newrepublic.com/article/120185/inside-americas-number-1-party-school-university-pennsylvania which I've been told isn't very reliable, but which I'm looking to you to shed some light on. Either way, I'd say the essence of my worries is that Penn is a) pre-professional b) exceedingly social. On a), I don't think I would be comfortable in a pre-professional environment with pervasive peer pressure to get that next internship. Just a personal preference, not a value judgment. On b), I'm fairly introverted - and obviously what worries me is not ""is Penn social"" (obviously yes) but more like ""if you are not exceedingly social then is Penn difficult"" for which I'd particularly like to hear from introverted Penn students and whether they feel like they can't find a space. 

In addition, does the economics major at Penn play second fiddle to business? I've heard this is generally true at places with a strong business program, eg. Penn, NYU, Stanford.

I know I come off as exceedingly negative, but I'm honestly looking to have my view changed. I know the reliability of my understanding is suspect, so if you have a way to address my concerns, I'd love it if you could.

Thanks!"

Moreover, the eSports team is looking for more members; we need as many people as possible so that we have substitutes and can field the best possible lineup in our summer league games! Currently two of our starters are Class of 2017 seniors, so they will be eligible for summer league play but there is no guarantee they will be eligible for any tournaments beginning in Fall 2017 and later, so we need some of the younger students to step up and fill their shoes when they're gone!

Seriously, the eSports team needs as many members as we can get. Don't be shy, even if you think you might not be good enough or whatever. With college students' schedules we need lots of players to choose from just to ensure that we can field a full 3-player roster for every match :)

I was wondering if the work study is too demanding? How many hours does it require in a typical week? What are some of the jobs on campus that can be used for work study (based on your experiences or your friends)? Since I am a native Spanish speaker, I was thinking about being a tutor at Penn's Language Studies for my work study. I was given a work study of $3,500. Right now, I am in the College, but possibly would like to pursue an uncoordinated dual degree program of study with Wharton. I know I am going to be swamped with trying to take all these courses to apply to a dual degree by the end of my freshman year. So, is the work study worth it, or is it advisable to get an outside scholarship to cover this?

Since application season is starting up I thought it would be nice to make a small post about applying to Penn. But first off some background on the Penn application process itself:

Penn has 4 schools: the College (CAS), the school of engineering and applied sciences (SEAS), the Wharton business school (Wharton), and nursing. When you graduate from Penn, you will graduate with a degree in one of these four schools (or multiple degrees...but that will be addressed later on). Within each degree, you can have one or multiple majors. E.g. A person can have a degree from SEAS with two majors (in computer science and linguistics). Note that majors are somewhat school specific. For example, only engineering offers computer science majors, but they allow college students to get a computer science major as well. The college allows pretty much anyone from any school to get any of the college majors. Wharton does not allow you to get a major from them (if you are in another school) since they only offer a single degree with ""concentrations"". Nursing also only offers nursing degrees to their students (no majors like Wharton). 

  - A degree from a school entails with it some base requirements that are not necessarily specific to the major you get from the school. e.g. A college student will need to complete some base requirements (foundational, sector, and language requirements) in addition to their major. same with engineering. A person who chooses to do a degree + 1st major from the college and a second major from engineering will need to only do the base college requirements, their college major, and their engineering major (but not engineering requirements). 

- Dual degrees allow you to graduate with two degrees from two separate schools. There are two ways you can do this: uncoordinated and coordinated. For uncoordinated, you'll be doing base requirements for both schools plus the requirements for majors...which is a lot. You apply for an uncoordinated degree typically after your freshman year (the application process can be restrictive if you want a second degree in Wharton). Coordinated dual degree programs allow you to skip some of these requirements (but you will need to apply for these programs). The coordinated dual degree programs are listed here: http://www.admissions.upenn.edu/apply/specialized (That link also has some specialized programs that aren't dual degree). You can apply to these programs after your freshman year as well, but they are restrictive (req a high GPA after your freshman year). *General Advice: Apply for a dual degree program as your primary choice and a single degree as your second choice*. if you don't get the dual degree, you will still be considered for your second choice.

---
*Applying (how do I get in?)*: 

I won't go into how to fill out the common app since there are tons of resources for that already. But in general, your application should be focused on selling yourself and finding something that makes you unique. Focus on objective measures of how good you are/what you can contribute to Penn (and how you can take advantage of Penn's resources). Additionally, give some proof of your proficiency in doing something. For example, if you say you say you are a good programmer, then *show* that don't *tell* me (e.g. something about an app you've created and how you self-learned, got x amount of users, improved upon that, and how a formal CS education will help). 

If things haven't changed much, the general application essay is usually something along the lines of ""Why Penn?"". And tbh...the essay question sucks and leads to some fairly monotonous essays that are super cringeworthy when you read them. It's fine, just write it. The general format is ""I am good in X. Here is an example of how I was good in X, with some measures of success Y. Hey. omg. Penn has professor/program/major Z that does exactly X!"" and continue that for like 600 words.

*But what if I don't have anything to sell myself on?*

Make something to sell yourself with. Not everyone can be a national winner in FBLA or whatever, but there are numerous things you can do on your own that are impressive in their own right e.g. start a nonprofit, do research that gets published, write a novel, etc. Self-endeavors like the above are best for your application because a) they are impressive and b) you can't necessarily compare candidate A and candidate B without further research (and trust me...college admissions won't spend time researching your claims unless there is a huge red flag...take that as you may). 

*But what about my stats?*

Holistic admissions will only help so much. Your stats (GPA and SAT/ACT) are critical to your application. Think of your app like a cake, your stats are the base of the cake, extracurriculars are icing. Too little base makes the cake entirely icing which is going to be way too sweet (hence you won't like it too much...or at least I don't like too much icing...so the analogy is fitting from my perspective lol). 

So if you are from an average public school, some things admissions may want to see: you are at least in the top 10% of your class, are scoring in the 2250+ SAT Range (1500-1520 on new SAT) or a 33+ ACT range. If you are a URM (hispanic, african american, etc), you may have *some* leeway, but not too much. If you are asian (like me), max these stats since a lot of applicants' stats will be high as well (sorry...it sucks i know). Again, the leeway is entirely speculation on my part.

*When should I apply?*

If you have lower stats/know you want to go to penn, apply ED. You will be rewarded since it has a higher admit rate. Additionally, if you  are waitlisted in ED you have a slightly higher chance in RD (again, slight speculation). Note ED means you cannot apply to any other school ED but are free to apply to other schools EA (but not REA...but check your other school's policy for that). 

*What about dat $$$?* 

Penn's financial aid programs are very generous but consult with them if you have questions since everything is on a case by case basis. If you have concerns, talk to them sooner rather than later (this is more true when you get admitted). 

*What if I get in?*

Congrats! (Join our meme page and rejoice in the #struggle: https://www.facebook.com/groups/966590693376781/) 

*What if I don't get in?*

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWVElQ6NfcE This application process is shitty. I will be the first one to say it. I mean think about it, like a total of 5 minutes will be spent screening an application you spent months putting together...there is just a ton of context you can't necessarily put into your application. Just take the rejection in stride, move on to the place that is best for you. Trust me, you will make new friends in new places + create new opportunities no matter what. Anyway, you will probs kill it in any other place. (and join our meme page anyway and laugh at our #struggle: https://www.facebook.com/groups/966590693376781/) 

*Can I PM you about X?*

In general, sure! But I won't give my application essays (bc I don't have them anymore) nor share any of my personal information. Besides, it would be best to post in the subreddit for more specific info (and better response times)."

* Make sure that your courses aren't satisfying ANY potential worksheet for your major. I held back on a requirement to delay graduation, but the registrar looked into my courses. I entered undergrad in 2013, but she determined that if I used the 2014-or-later CPG, I could be forced to graduate.

Money isn't too much of an issue. I like both programs course wise. This is currently how I view both schools:
USC:
\+ Great weather
\+ Great location
\+ Good program

UPenn:

I'm still stuck between Upenn and USC and was hoping for any insight.

Intended Major: Economics in Upenn CAS and Business in USC Marshall

Cost: USC--free tuition (USC Stamp Scholarship); Upenn--would have to pay full (affordable but still a hit on financials)

career: maybe Wall street for the first 2 years but I'm not too keen on it. I feel like I'd rather work for a big tech company

USC Pros: free tuition + 20k stipend, heard atmosphere is more chill/collaborative, can probably do better here academically

Upenn Pros: ivy league name opens doors to opportunities, close to home (I live in NJ), many upperclassmen friends going here, possibility of transferring into Wharton if I decide to try

I've visited and like them both, Upenn more but USC might give me a better quality of life next 4 years. Please help."

Illinois seems to have a bigger and higher ranked CS department than Penn. Penn is an Ivy with better connections in finance and consulting. 

At UIUC, I wouldn't need to take any physics or math (fulfilled by AP credits and dual-enrollment courses) so I would have the chance to go deeper into CS. UPenn doesn't take as many APs and probably won't take my dual credit for linear algebra and calc 3. I have significant programming experience (large Python projects and an iOS app). I'm interested in starting a career in tech after college. 

Illinois is a massive engineering school with a ton of resources in every discipline. CS is arguably the top major on campus. Penn is a mid sized Ivy where Wharton is the top school on campus. Illinois is a big state school with a diverse range of people. Penn has an overall smarter undergraduate population. 

I'm from northern IL so UIUC is closer and less expensive. Cost is a factor, but not the deciding one in my decision. 

Where should I go?

If there's anything I said above that is incorrect based on your experience, please correct me. I'm visiting Penn next week. I've been to Illinois before and will likely return for another visit. 

I'm posting this on r/UIUC as well to get both perspectives. Thanks!

I'm majoring in Bio / Biochem for pre-med and I've had a few burning questions that I really need to hear real Penn students to answer. 

* How is the Vagelos Program in the Molecular Life Sciences? Especially for pre-med? This is pretty much my main reason for considering Penn as a top choice. It seems like a really cool opportunity but I'm skeptical because of its bad retention rate.

* Is there really a consumerist / elitist culture or is that an overplayed stereotype? As a first-gen student, hearing horror stories about people not wanting to hang out with you because you're not wearing designer clothes really scares me. I was hoping this was just a Wharton thing or specific to Greek culture. Is it as bad as it's made out to be?

* Is it true that it's insanely hard to get involved in student organizations? I'm really afraid of having nothing to do because I've gotten rejected from every club I apply to.

I applied to both as a biophysics major with intention to go premed, but a variety of things has caused me to worry.

One: Biophysics isn’t exactly what I thought it was. Honestly, when I was applying I was like “Well I like bio and I like physics so why not?” I think I’d be more interested in something like just physics, neuroscience, or engineering.

Two: The more I learn about premed/med school, the less I want to do it. It sounds extremely stressful and rigorous for no reason with my level of interest in the field. But, what kind of job can a degree in neuroscience get without going premed.

Three: I was admitted to the College of Arts and Sciences. If I wanted to do some type of engineering, how much would it take for me to transfer into SEAS. Would it set me back? How is the BS in engineering different from the BA that the College offers? I know that I can’t transfer until I have spent a year in the College, so would I preemptively change to the College’s engineering program?

Thanks for any advice.

I have a few questions about Penn Clubs as a rising high school senior interested in Penn:

1. Are Penn/Wharton clubs exclusive?  I've heard mixed opinions on this one, and apparently some clubs need an application for a chance to get in like Consulting / Investment, and do not accept that many freshman
2. When do clubs start?  Is there a 'club season' that Penn determines or are clubs run freely by the club presidents?
3. What is the normal time commitment for clubs (e.g. x hours per week)?  
4. At what time do clubs occur?  Before classes, lunch, after classes?  Or all three?
5. At what year could you apply for a committee/board position of a club?  Do you have to be a member in it already to then apply for the higher positions?
6. Usually how many clubs would you do in freshman year?  I really want to try out as many as possible!

 

For reference, I'm looking at the below clubs:

\- Wharton Investment and Trading Group

\- Wharton Undergraduate Finance Club

\- Wharton Undergraduate Consulting Club

\- Penn International Impact Consulting

\- PennSEM

&amp;#x200B;

If I were to be accepted to the clubs above (idk how rigorous it is to get in but let's just assume), how many would be a healthy number to try out (or which ones)?  I really want to do all but I don't think that's possible haha - it really depends on the time commitment per week.

&amp;#x200B;

If anything above is not clear, please let me clarify!

Thanks in advance."

When I first read the dining plans, my first impression was that the AFK (16 swipes/week &amp; $140 dining dollars) would be the wisest decision. I eat 2-3 meals a day and having 16 swipes would guarantee me that routine. 

Upon reading some posts, I noticed that most Quakers recommend the plan with the most dining dollars &amp; least swipes. I can't help but wonder the reasoning behind this. 8 swipes/week would get me 1 meal a day and $400 dining dollars doesn't seem enough to let me achieve my routine. Won't I end up having to spend out of my allowance/own money to do this?

CAS: you're limited to 4.5 CU. If you're premed, basically take 1 science course + the lab (1.5 CU), writing sem, and any two other courses (one of which could be possibly math 104/114).

MLS kids...you do you (but basically follow the guide on the website).  


SEAS: Go cray. Anything around 5-5.5 is considered average. Anything above that should only be done if you're planning to go on the dual degree route. CIS people: no pressure to take 160 your first sem. Also note that 110/120 + 160 is a lot of work, so take some lighter courses with that (unless you know discrete math already).

It seems like everybody here has no time to foster a meaningful relationship with another person, and instead chooses to hook up. This culture is pervasive, and seems to be taken to the extreme. 

I was booty called Sunday night. When I got to her room, I could tell something was wrong. She explained that she was behind schedule on her CIS homework, and that she could only have sex if she could work on her homework at the same time. 

It seemed like a fine idea to me; it would check two things from the to do list at once. So, with my face buried in my Spanish textbook, and her torso hunched over a MacBook Pro opened to Codio.com, we shared eight sweaty minutes of doggy style productivity.

The highlight of the evening was when she asked if I’d try BDSM. I agreed and she pulled out an Orgo textbook and asked me punish her.  
So I turned to Chapter 12, and asked her review questions. 

Each synthesis question cracked like a whip. As she demanded, “MORE!” and the pages turned, I took a moment to reflect...

I had come to her room searching for companionship, but when I came in her room, I found only two burned-out shells of people, yearning for a feeling.

This isn’t love, and this isn’t learning. 

How can I find a happy relationship in a place like this?"

It has been on him for six years now, and he is so relieved to have this pressure removed, like taking off a tight bra after a month straight at the gym. He at last feels at ease, confident even, and now that he has passed the final judgment of his peers you can see the professor's individuality begin to spark. Now is his hey day. He has his students call him ""Chris"" or even ""C.C."". He wears funky vintage shirts from his youth, with the top three buttons undone and his chest hairs aerating. He curves all of his classes to an A. Even those fintech Whartonites can squeak by with an A- and go on to so-so Masters programs at University of Rochester. His T.A.s grade on intent over result. Parsed Seinfield corpuses make their way into the project courses. Everyone laughs at his jokes, and not just the front row sycophants. DARPA gives him top secret clearance and a check worth $2,400,000. For what? You ask. He can't tell you about it, unless he gets to kill you. And he would. But that's just the price you pay for not being Chris.

Most (BUT NOT ALL AND IT'S OKAY IF YOU DON'T GET ONE) applicants will have an interview anytime between now and the end of November. 

Feel free to ask specific questions to people here (and check out previous threads below), there are multiple alumni interviewers that are active on this sub (including me). The best advice I can give is to be prepared, speak your truth, be an advocate for yourself (the interview is NOT the time to be humble), and try to have a relaxing, comfortable conversation about your strengths and experiences. Also, definitely research things about Penn that you can specifically reference to when explaining why you want to come to Penn. Also don't google your interviewer. It's super weird when you do this.

That's pretty much all there is to it. BUT if you are freaking out a bit, here's some other information that may be helpful:

QUESTIONS YOU MAY GET/MIGHT WANT TO HAVE ANSWERS TO

Recommended questions for interviewers:

Note: You shouldn't memorize any answers to these questions. They should come naturally. It's helpful to prepare to make sure you hit on a few key points you want to get across, but if you sound like a robot, it won't look good. These are just RECOMMENDED questions, so you aren't guaranteed to get any of them (In fact, many interviewers don't know this lists exists and won't use any of these questions). During my interviews, I usually start off with a few questions that I want to make sure I get, but the conversation that follows usually comes natural (i.e., I ask follow up questions that relate to what the applicant says).

*General introduction*

Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?

How would your friends describe you?

What experiences have you had with people who are different from you?

What would you like the Admissions office to know that might not appear in your application?

*Academic and Personal interests*

What do you most like learning about?

How do you learn best?

What is your favorite part of your school experience?

What topics or assignments have you found particularly intriguing?

Is there anything that you would change about your high school experience?

How do you spend your time when you're not in school?

What's the biggest challenge you've overcome?

*What would this student be like at Penn?*

Why Penn? How did you first hear about Penn?

What draws you to the undergraduate school/program to which you’ve applied?

What on-campus opportunities are you most excited about?

*Share your Penn experience*

What questions do you have?

Is there anything you’d like to tell me that I haven’t asked you about?

IF (and that's a big IF) the question of you choosing to take classes Pass / Fail during the pandemic comes up in a job interview process, and the potential employer views your completion of a class with a P/F as a negative, **you have just been given a gift of knowing that you can avoid proceeding through the interview process with an absolutely morally bankrupt, awful company.** 

When deciding whether or not to swap over to P/F, make that decision based on your capabilities and mental health right now. Do not make it based on what you think a hiring officer might think in the future.

When you are in interviews in the future, and it comes time for you to have the chance to ask your interviewer questions about the company, one of them should be:

&gt;""What did Company X do to protect your employees and customers during the pandemic? How did Company X ensure the continued safety and financial / health insurance security of your employees?""

Any company that tries to ding you for taking a class pass / fail or doesn't have a ready and satisfactory answer to the above should be avoided like the plague, so to speak.

Take care of yourself. The fact that you are completing classes AT ALL during this pandemic is a huge win. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3"

i just heard back from the college office, and i got approved to return from my leave of absence! although it's not much since everything is remote right now, it means the world to me. i had applied back last fall, and they originally approved, but then ultimately decided to deny my request :( which made me extremely anxious and ruined my plans.

it's been about two years since getting into penn, and being stuck in the house all day during quarantine has made me think a lot about the time since then. although, tbh i have thought about my time at penn and what went wrong almost everyday since requesting to take a leave of absence way back in spring 19. as of now i'm set to resume classwork this summer (which unfortunately is online now :// but this shouldn't affect my ""return"" though). just the thought of being enrolled again and resuming classes terrifies me, with my mind immediately jumping to the worst case scenario which is me f\*cking up everything just like i did last year.

\*\*\*PREFACE\* i went to a very average public school (and by average i mean AVERAGE AVERAGE, not ivy average. as in, it's ranked in the bottom half of public schools in my state and around #20 out of 25 in my region) that was hardly rigorous in any field and definitely did not receive enough preparation for going to an elite uni. i was admittedly really lazy in hs as well as depressed, spending more times on mindless activities than homework or ecs. which isn't 100 percent my fault, as activities outside of sports at my school weren't big and major assignments were rarely assigned. i deadass completed at most two full length papers my entire high school career, submitted countless hw in late or completed right in class when it was due, etc. i did obviously partake enough to succeed relative to my school and eventually got into penn. but looking back, it really was me underachieving bc there was no point in working hard if i didn't have to\*\*

anyways, my freshman year was much less than ideal. after suffering a lackluster fall semester, i tried to redeem myself in the spring, but failed to do so. maybe it was my countless club rejections, or the overwhelming amount of work i put off to the last minute. the fact that i still had no idea what i wanted to study or was interested in didn't help at all. i felt extremely overwhelmed by the thoughts that nothing had gone to plan, and that i no longer had a plan that actually suited me. my classes were horrible, i was stuck in a toxic friendship, the clubs i was in did not suit me and stressed me out to the point i ghosted all of them. it's not because i didn't want to try. i don't know how many nights i spent until 4am with my laptop open trying to get started, but failing to complete my work. i didn't know what was wrong with me. all i could think about constantly was how much a failure i was, that i had no future and would end up miserable and unemployed and 100k in debt after graduating, and that i should've applied to better schools and penn was the worst choice i made in my life. it didn't help that my friends were in similar positions to me, and my self-esteem was solely tied to receiving attention from guys and putting myself in very dangerous situations. i stopped attending class, and it got so bad to the point that i requested a leave literally a week before finals. i couldn't even bring myself to finish the spring semester, it got so bad. i've never been so embarrassed, so ashamed in my life. my parents got me and moved me out, we fought because i didn't want to go back home, so i went back to philly. this all happened by may 2019. since then, things with my family have been better than ever. i lived in philly (just thru sublets) from may until december, when i moved back with my family. i've been seeing a therapist/psychiatrist for months, been diagnosed with anxiety, mild depression, and adjustment disorder, and was placed on a mild ssri. my mental health state has never been better, even during quarantine haha. 

so it's all worked out somewhat, but at the same time, not at all yet. as of now i'm set to return shortly, major in econ, go into business or the like, etc. part of me still thinks it's going to end badly again. i think it's partially because i feel like have no support. i feel like no matter how hard i try, i'll for some reason never achieve my goals or will end up unhappy in life. it seems like the majority of ppl at penn have their shit together (for the most part) and will go on to find success in their jobs and relationships, and a good portion of students will do just that. however, there's always the less fortunate, even at schools like penn. not everyone in the ivy league can succeed, even at hyp there will be unemployable graduates who amount to nothing in my life. i can't let that happen to me. i want to succeed, i NEED to succeed, and i know i CAN. but will i? part of me feels like there's a force in the universe, call it fate or bs, that is just out to get me and will stop at nothing to end me. call me crazy, but i just feel like my life will somehow just completely fall apart bc of bad luck or chance, and i'll spend the rest of my life wondering what went wrong.

i'm not sure what the purpose of this rant is. maybe to warn the future penn students that getting into the ivy league is just the start, as for many of us we still face an uphill battle in this world, even though many of us are admittedly more privileged than the average american. but even if we don't feel like it, each and all of us was admitted for a reason, and are equally deserving of our spots. my mental health took a massive dive when i started at penn, and never had before felt as stupid or a failure at life. so please take care of yourself and then maybe there's hope for us :)"

Does it make sense to continue charging or paying full tuition in this far from normal time? Stores refund defective products, would it be too much to ask to make a slight comparison? And if this continues into the Fall and beyond, what of the freshmen for whom a live environment is critical for their next chapter into university life? What about students who took on substantial debt to come here? It doesn't seem fair even to those who can more easily afford this.

I'm a graduate student at UC Berkeley. Due to the quarantine a friend and I started coordinating Zoom lunches for students at UC Berkeley. We currently have students from UC Berkeley, CMU, and Georgia Tech, and we'd love it if students from UPenn also joined! Basically you sign up, and we'll pair you up with 3 other students to virtually meet up for lunch over Zoom. Ideally we'd like to provide more social interaction for people stuck at home as well as an opportunity to meet new people with different interests. If you'd like to meet other students, likely from different majors and different schools, feel free to fill out the form below.

hge06k,https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/hge06k/opinion_next_year_will_be_a_clean_slate_for_greek/,OPINION: Next year will be a clean slate for Greek Life,23,10,2020-06-26 12:17:20,"**SERIOUS:**

Whether you love it or hate it, greek life is a significant part of the social scene at Penn. Not any more. [New policies](https://fall-2020-planning.upenn.edu/content/student-campus-compact) will make it significantly harder to recruit a new year's pledge class. Fraternities will need to develop new methods to recruit rushes due to the absence of parties. No longer will freshmen receive mysterious envelopes under their door. Dorm buildings will likely restrict access from non-residents, and freshmen will be further spread out. If sorority and fraternity rush happens this year, it would have to be on a much smaller scale in the spring. If it does not occur at all, greek organizations could be in financial trouble.

Usually, University-owned houses must be at capacity, or Penn will fine them. This year is a different situation, of course. Due to housing restrictions, some greek houses will not be able to make capacity. I expect Penn will not fine them, but the organization will make less money from members. This change in capacity may create more demand for off-campus housing.

But what if there is no rush this year? At least, greek organizations will suffer financially. At most, off-campus houses will not have enough residents to pay for next year.

What does this mean from the social side? A new generation of freshmen *and rising sophomores* will have little preconceived notions. NSO is a unique time when students have no work and can learn about fraternities through partying if they so choose. Many times, NSO is where students first learn about each fraternity. Freshmen will not have this opportunity. They will have little knowledge of historical inter-greek politics.

Next year will be an excellent time to recruit students based on what *really* matters: sisterhood and brotherhood.

Rush Spades.

The schools had asked for a temporary restraining order pausing enforcement of the policy.

At a short hearing Tuesday afternoon, U.S. District Judge Allison D. Burroughs confirmed that a settlement had been reached. She said the government would rescind the policy, withdraw an FAQ detailing the rule and return to the status quo of guidance issued in the spring.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had issued regulations earlier this month limiting foreign students’ ability to take classes online and stay in the U.S. Many colleges and universities have adjusted their teaching plans for fall in light of the coronavirus pandemic, including opting for online-only courses, and the regulations have upended international students’ plans.

Harvard and MIT said in a court filing Tuesday, before the hearing, that they and their students would face “irreparable injury” if an injunction wasn’t granted. They had also filed declarations from students who said they wouldn’t be able to participate in online instruction from their home countries, because of government restrictions or poor internet service.

I think my raw grade right now is in the C range and I honestly have no idea how the class is getting curved. I'm only getting more lost as the class progresses so I'm debating between dropping the class or taking it P/F. I might be able to scrape by with a passing grade but the weekly quizzes are honestly stressing me out so much.

Since I'm basically learning all the material on my own, I was wondering if it'd be better to drop the class and either take it again next semester or keep up with the self-learning and try taking the credit exam in the spring. I feel like I'm better off learning on my own without the stress of weekly quizzes. However, I'm not sure what the P/F policy will be like in the future so I'm not sure if I should take advantage of it now while I still have the chance.

So my story is a bit all over the place. I'm 30, twice immigrant, and on the autistic spectrum (wasn't diagnosed until a few years ago). Because of my disability and unstable family situation I had trouble finishing high school. I dropped out a year before I was due to graduate HS to start working at a tech job full time (I'm self taught in my field). I'm still working in tech to this day and have worked in a few big FAANG level companies. I speak 2 other languages besides English on a native level and have been studying Japanese for the past year.

I'm looking to get on a path to finally earn a college degree in the coming  years. I'd have to re-do my HS diploma and all the tests so it might take a while.

I'm located in PA and UPenn/Wharton's Huntsman Program caught my  attention.  The combination of liberal arts, business and languages is  precisely  what I'm looking for. I get bored easily (one of the reasons I  dropped  out of HS) and due to my autism I need something rigorous and   intellectually stimulating.

I'm not deluding myself that I have as strong of a profile as someone non-autistic who was born to a middle class family, finished HS and had access to education and tutoring. The Huntsman Program also does seem to require living on campus and I'm married and have my own house, so I'm not sure if it's viable for me. But I'd like to try nevertheless or apply  to a  program of that same academic level.

**TLDR**

Having a deadline like that in fact will put more stress on students. I feel some other methods may encourage students to work as hard as they can, but also have less stress. 

One strategy (I vagely remember that it was used by Swarthmore) is under the pandemic situation, students could set a goal for the class (let's say around the p/f deadline). For instance, I set my goal for Class A to be 90, and if I get a 90 or above, it will show as a letter grade, and if I get a 89, it will be a pass. I will work as hard as I can for this class to get a 90+, but if for some reason I didn't do well in the second half of the course, (COVID effect, online distraction, or other reasons), I won't get let's say a C or something but just a pass.

Everyone should hear this information before deciding to participate.

The link to this was emailed to the entire Sophomore class with the disclaimer “And don't worry, your responses are completely confidential.” There is also a disclaimer on the front page of the website that responses are confidential. This is blatantly false and a correction should be issued as soon as possible.

In their “Data Principles and Practices” document they do not go nearly far enough to make me comfortable with the way our data is being stored and used. They call the outlined information an “informal policy” (aka in no way binding). While they say they will never sell information, it could still be accessed by anyone who works for them, and this policy could always be broken (many other companies have made this promise and later broken it). About how long they hold onto your data, they say “In general, we store information until it’s no longer needed to run the Marriage Pact.” This is an extremely vague policy which pretty much permits them to indefinitely hold onto the data. There also does not seem to be any option to have your data deleted. They say you can withdraw your request to be matched, but nothing about where your data goes. 

We don’t know WHO gets to view and access the data. It is mentioned that 4 Penn students “helped” to bring the Marriage Pact to Penn. Can they see our responses? 

We don’t know where the data is stored or if it is encrypted. Is it in an excel spreadsheet on someone’s computer? If so, is that computer password-protected? Is the document also password-protected?  Is the data encrypted? Is it in the cloud? We don’t know, so you should assume the worst, which is that someone who steals this person’s laptop, or perhaps gains access to their Google Drive account, will know how much you like kinky sex on a scale from 1 to 7, your political opinions, and more, and is free to tell the world about it. Even if the people running the website have good intentions, they most likely are storing the data in a location that is not properly secured, which puts respondents at risk. A lot of damage has been done with less information than what you are volunteering here.

The people who run Marriage Pact are collecting highly sensitive information about thousands of students and are not telling us anywhere close to enough about what they plan to do with it. 

Just be aware before filling it out that you’re giving highly personal information to people (whose identities are unknown!) who are under no legal obligation to keep it private."

lx98u4,https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/lx98u4/addressing_penn_marriage_pact_data_privacy/,Addressing Penn Marriage Pact Data Privacy Concerns,67,10,2021-03-03 17:18:57,"Hey everyone! We have heard that there are some concerns about the Marriage Pact, and so we’d like to take the opportunity to clear these things up. With the ways data has been mishandled online by different companies in the past, it’s totally fair to be skeptical, and we spent some time looking into these things too before we decided to do it. We definitely appreciate the people who’ve brought this up; we really want to clear the air around this stuff and address your concerns as best as we can.

First off, we really are a team of excited Penn students—we’re working together with the students from Stanford who started the project (it’s been running for 4 years there!) to bring it to Penn. We figured it’s a chance to make the kind of connection we’re all missing right now.

The questionnaire does ask about some sensitive things. Here’s why: the idea behind the Penn Marriage Pact is to find your best backup plan—like the person you could marry if you’re both 30 and still single. And when you look at what matters in really long-term relationships (say 50 years-long), it isn’t what music you listen to or what your favorite ice cream flavor is. It’s really your core values and the things that matter to you deep down. So in order to find that person who’s a practical choice, we use Marriage Pact’s specially-designed questions to ask about those things.

Because there are sensitive questions involved, privacy is also super important, so we’ve worked hard to design it into the system anywhere and everywhere we can. **Nobody on the launch team has access to any response data (whether from Penn or the Stanford kids who are helping us here).** And the matching is run purely via algorithm, so nobody looks at individual answers (we will only get summary statistics to make sure the matching worked). During matching, the algorithm even uses unique IDs for each person so it’s anonymous as to anyone’s name or contact info.

The data isn’t stored on anyone’s laptop or anyone’s google account. We use Typeform for the questionnaire, which outlines its security [here](https://help.typeform.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029259552-Security-at-Typeform), and Mailchimp to send the emails and they outline their security [here](https://mailchimp.com/about/security/). We’re setting up the algorithm to run on Amazon Web Services, which many other organizations use to house their data (US/Pacific Northwest; [AWS Data Privacy](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-privacy-faq/) ), so nobody will see or handle any sensitive personal data on their laptops to do the matching.

Finally, we included the Data Principles &amp; Practices document because we mean it. These days, you’ll hardly find anyone clearly stating “Your privacy is not for sale”—but those sections were really important to us. **Neither we nor Marriage Pact make any money from operating and we certainly do not sell anyone’s data.** In addition, it's worth noting that schools like Stanford, UVM,  Columbia, and more have participated in this without any data privacy issues. 

It’s always your decision to participate! You can opt-out at any time, and we honor all deletion requests—just shoot us an email at **penn@marriagepact.com**, and we’ll delete all your records (just make sure you’re emailing from the Penn email you used to sign up).

I was admitted to CAS.

1. **Should I apply for BFS in the College**: I intend to major in math/Logic, Information, and Computation and potentially dual degree at SEAS for CS or Electrical Engineering. It seems the BFS this year focuses on earth science, history of science, anthropology etc. And it suggests that BFS would consume 50% of first term classes and 40% of second term classes. So, is it going to help me in terms of fulfilling major requirement or graduation requirement?
2. **How difficult is it to get a dual degree at SEAS from College?** As mentioned in the last paragraph, how hard would the dual degree application between CAS and SEAS go? I know double major between the two is way easier, but how hard is dual degree essentially? And to apply for dual degree after the end of freshman, is it better to not go to BFS so that I can work toward that direction of dual degree? (by taking some CS classes etc.)
3. **If I want to do CS, and want to learn some theoretical side of CS in the College, is ""Logic, Information, and Computation"" major a good choice?** Or mathematics, which I originally applied to."

I just wish someone warned me about this school before I applied. I don't have a single good experience to share. Will probably delete later but I just needed to vent.

One thing I want to ask is, what is wrong with some of the ppl here? I can literally make a blacklist out of the dudes who verbally harrassed me and I haven't even set foot on campus yet. An upperclassmen tried to stalk me and said he'd come to my house even before Regular Decision results were out. The amount of sex memes I received and ignored during this year is astounding. I never really know what the trigger is. I'm not even gonna try to list the other suggestive or overly flirty messages I received. I'm such an introvert that I never slide into ppl's DMs and don't even really try to get to know someone. Everything happens after I engage in clubs, class, etc. I tried talking to TAs, club leadership, CAPS, etc. but they're always quick to reassure that it's not my fault and do nothing to fix the problem. Some ppl even suggested that getting attention is good, or that I should tell them when things like this happens so they won't be victimized like me. 

I'm just so tired of being objectified. I've had a similar experience with a professor during high school and I'm just tired of just being disappointed in people in general. Not even disappointed ig, because I stopped assuming that ppl are going to be genuine long time ago lol. With my personality, I had a hard time trusting ppl and tbh I don't really have anyone I'd consider to be my friend at this school.

My household isn't helping either. I'm going to spare the details and just say that my parents literally watch me like security cameras to make sure I'm getting work done. I'm just tired to hearing my family fight with each other because of academics. Psychiatrist and pills for depression aint really helping anymore. Tried to die three times this sem and now that I know I'm not going to succeed, I just spend my time sleeping 17 hours a day.

This semester just burned me through and through. I'm so burned out from academics and the stuff listed above, and my grades (which is probably the only thing that was stable in my life so far) crashed too. It's not the not the end of the world, ik, but I honestly don't know what to do now. I hate home and I hate school. I feel like there is no place where I truly feel at ease and noone I can depend on. I don't know whether I should take a LOA or just transfer out to another school. LOA will mean I’d be stuck home, and idk if transferring out would solve the problem cuz I could experience the same things at another school."

neu444,https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/neu444/got_into_wharton_as_an_external_transfer_any/,Got into Wharton as an external transfer. Any advice appreciated from current transfers/Wharton students!!,1,8,2021-05-17 15:40:20,"Hi everyone! So Penn Transfer decisions came out today and I actually cannot believe I got in. Wharton was my *dream* school when I was in high school, and of course I got rejected and it crushed me. Anyway, I ended up going to my state school (big 10 school, think Penn State, Wisconsin, etc) as a finance major, and while I was at home the whole year, I actually ended up really enjoying it and making a bunch of friends. I was so certain that I wouldn't get in that I was fully expecting to go back in the fall, and I was actually hoping for a rejection from Penn just so I wouldn't have to worry about transferring, but I just don't feel the happiness I thought I would because I'm so nervous about it. 

My main concerns are the price (I would have to pay full tuition &amp; board - \~80k compared to my state school which is like 20k, but my parents are willing to fund it) and the social scene. Is it a lot more difficult to make friends considering there aren't many Wharton transfers? Do you think that the price of Wharton is justified?

Honestly, I feel like I can't say no to Wharton (and I know I don't sound too excited, but trust me, it was my dream school), but I'm just super worried that I'll end up regretting transferring if I don't have a good time. 

ANY advice would be much appreciated, I don't have much time to make a decision and would love to hear about your experiences at Penn. Thank you!! Also, I do want to work in investment banking out of undergrad and concentrate in finance (yes I'm one of those - I know the Wharton name carries you so far in finance and I don't go to a target currently)."

As mentioned above I am currently a 2nd year undergrad CS/Neuro student in Melbourne, Australia, and have been wanting to do exchange in the US for sooooo long. Now that I am at the stage of applications, I need some guidance to know which campuses to apply to and how to make the most of my exchange.

I've read that it can be difficult for exchange students to integrate into and connect with students and Frat members, and thus it is hard to get into parties/events etc. (esp for guys). I'd consider myself a sociable bloke and can get along with most types of people, are there any fraternities and clubs that are usually open to Australian exchange students having some beers and kicking it with them for a Semester long exchange? I have read soo much into the Greek culture and really appreciate the brotherhood that can form from them (having come from a very tight all boys highschool), and although I won't be committing a full 4 years to the group, are fraternities usually friendly with keen aussies? 

Outside of frats, what is the greatest way to build connections with smart and fun individuals at UPenn as an exchange student? And are UPenn students in general a welcoming group to Aussie exchange students?

Additionally is there anything to watch out for IF I can make it into Upenn as an exchange student?

Any advice or words of wisdom is welcome!! Cheers"

After looking through the clubs and their applications, my imposter syndrome is at an all-time high: HTF did I get into this school?

During high school, I was mainly doing theoretical research in mathematics, music, and philosophy; anything ""applied science"" or ""pre-professional"" are completely NEW to me. I have ZERO work experience... do not know what I am going to major... do not know what industry I am going to work in... do not know basically anything. I have no exp in financing, consulting, marketing; AP-level experience in CS... Now, I am quite interested in doing some pre-professional stuff, because, you know, it is University of Pennsylvania. I begin to worry about my future. No club--&gt;nothing on my resume--&gt; no internship --&gt; no job........

Questions:

1. I do know that many clubs have general membership that does not require an application. But, seriously, how much can you gain from being a general member?
2. Is it common for a freshman to not have any official position/ leadership in any club during the first semester?
3. What is the first step you should do if you want to transform from theoretical to pre-professional?
4. Are there still opportunities for CURF? Is it already too late?

I think I would really like the various classes I would be able to take at Penn and there is much more diversity than say MIT, where everyone is doing STEM. 

however I am really concerned about the opportunities, one would get at MIT. will it be significant and if one works hard would he be able to get those opportunities, facilities at Penn? 

please I am just a 17 year old, who thinks if go to Penn, i can take classes at Wharton, take deep dive in physics and maths \[ am I wrong ?\], whereas if there is a significant difference then I would like to go to MIT like college? 

i just don't know that if i want to dive into research and choose Penn, how much would it differ ?

## Original Message
A Message to the Penn Community

from
Amy Gutmann, President
Beth Winkelstein, Interim Provost
Craig Carnaroli, Senior Executive Vice President
J. Larry Jameson, Executive Vice President for the Health System

As we wish you all a joyful and healthy holiday break, we write to update you on our plans to start the new semester in a way that ensures the safest and most fulsome Penn educational experience.

Recognizing the high level of concern about the Omicron variant and its potential impact on spring semester operations, we have been consulting closely with medical and public health experts, as well as monitoring data concerning the variant’s spread. While this is an uncertain situation, the data modeling suggests that we must take steps to prepare for a potential surge of cases in January. To that end, we summarize below our plan for the start of Penn’s 2022 spring semester. Our plan is designed to optimally protect the health and safety of our community and sustain the educational and research mission that defines our university. It is supported by the talented and dedicated Penn team that has done so much since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spring 2020.

### Delayed In-Person Classes and Student Move-In:

We will begin undergraduate classes as scheduled on January 12 in virtual formats online (except for clinical courses), and then transition to in-person classes on **January 24.** We will also delay undergraduate student move-in to campus housing by one week, to begin on **January 15.** More detailed information will follow in the coming weeks. Students in graduate and professional programs will receive additional guidance from their programs, as will postdoctoral fellows. These measures are designed to reduce the spread of COVID-19 on campus during the peak weeks of January when the spread will potentially be most active.

### Pre-Return to Campus Testing Requirements: 

All students will be required to complete a negative PCR test 48 hours before returning to campus. We will send more information in January about this requirement. Free testing will continue to be available to all students, faculty, staff and post-docs on campus throughout winter break; you can find the testing schedule here.

### Ongoing Mitigation Measures: 

We will continue to enforce our testing, masking, OpenPass, and vaccination guidelines, along with our new booster requirement. Upon initial return to campus, we will require a new gateway test for all faculty, staff, students, and post-docs. We also will continue our suspension of indoor social events. Dining will be grab-and-go pending further evaluation of the case trends. We will follow up in the new year with more details concerning these policies and action.

### Faculty and Staff Information: 

For faculty members, you will hear more from your individual deans about plans and protocols in your Schools. For staff members, we strongly encourage deans and vice presidents to allow employees to work remotely until January 23, when possible, given job responsibilities and organizational needs. UPHS-affiliated faculty and staff should follow guidance from the Health System. We are enormously appreciative of all employees who continue to work on campus in support of our entire community.

In the weeks ahead, we will continue to assess the evolving context and communicate to you about it. We will not hesitate to change our guidance based upon input from our medical and health experts. We are grateful for the patience, resilience, and flexibility of every member of our community as we face unpredictable circumstances together.

We again wish you a healthy and happy holiday break, and we look forward to getting started together on the spring semester in the new year."

Would really appreciate it since I don't really know how it all works at Penn and having trouble finding some specifics online.

&amp;#x200B;

Courses:

* CIS197 - Javascript (0.5 credit)
* CIS240 - Introduction to Computer Systems (1 credit)
* CIS419 - Applied Machine Learning (1 credit)
* EAS203 - Engineering Ethics (1 credit)
* MGMT291 - Negotiations
* Maybe another CIS 0.5 credit course? Mobile development?

(So a total of 4.5 - 5 credits)

&amp;#x200B;

The questions I mostly had are:

1. What's the chance that for some reason I wouldn't be able to get into any of one of these courses, especially CIS240 or EAS203, due to them being full? Basically just want to get an idea so I can plan around it, but the way I've planned it now I NEED to get CIS240 and EAS203 done in that semester.
2. What languages would be assumed knowledge for those courses? At that point I'd know C/C++/python/ARM assembly deeply and I aim to briefly introduce myself to Java before then.
3. How would this workload be? If I'm on exchange I probably don't want to be stressed out the whole time. I think it might be helped a little given that I've already done a reasonable amount of assembly + lots of C for CIS240, which I've read is pretty hard.

&amp;#x200B;

Any insight is really appreciated! Thanks in advance."
