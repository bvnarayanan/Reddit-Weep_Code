Hi all,

(I'm posting for my significant other who is one of your fellow students)

Yesterday (02/02/17), my SO met a man who had a beautiful, large, pure white husky/wolf dog outside of Wallis Annenberg. The man introduced the dog as ""Bear.""

Cut to today, my SO and I were walking along Exposition when we spotted a LOST DOG sign that featured a photo of beautiful, large, pure white husky/wolf dog named Bear. She had told me about the dog last night so I commented on the missing poster. Just to check, she called the number of the owner and sure enough, the owner had NOT found the dog. 

I just wanted to spread the word so we can help return this animal to its rightful owner! I reported this to campus security but they didn't rush out of their chairs or anything.

**If you see this man and/or dog, please immediately report it to campus security.**

The man with the dog is Hispanic, mid to late 40's, 5'7""ish.

Here is a photo of [Bear](http://imgur.com/a/GelXQ)

Send me a PM if you would prefer to contact me via cell phone as we are currently in contact with the owner.

Thanks, everyone!

Still mentally unstable still selling fake doors:

I wanted to explain succinctly why I love USC despite some of its problems in a short listicle that could maybe be stolen by a writer for the tab.

1. We have an extremely diverse student body. From different countries to different states to different SoCal backgrounds there is a representation of all identities on campus.

2. Our school is extremely involved in the city. No other school could put a city as large and important as Los Angeles in a complete whirlwind of change. No idea what's going on this week but I'll be damned if USC didn't play a part. 

3. Our alumni go on to do amazing things. From olympians to actors to scientists we have some alumni changing the world in all aspects of society. There's a reason snoop is on the sidelines of our games and it's not just because he's a bandwagon fan ;)

4. Our student organizations are incredible. From cutting edge rockets to a student government that makes national news (even if I vehemently disagree with some of their decisions) we have a niche for everyone to fill. 

5. We provide job opportunities to our graduates as long as they are working hard enough to find them.

6. We tolerate assholes who break rules.

7. We run La."

I've already done a year at USC and to be completely honest, I've been having trouble socially adapting and making friends ever since I got here. I've tried joining clubs and orgs on campus, I even managed to work at USG for a semester and yet I can't help but feel neglected. Last year, I ended up driving home every weekend to hangout with my old childhood friends. Sometimes they would ask why I come home so often and I can't help but feel like I messed up somehow.

For the record, this isn't me trying to put down USC as I'm ultimately blessed, as someone who barely graduated from high school, that I'm able to attend such a prestigious school. Any prospective applicants who have the chance to go here should know that the opportunities offered at this school in nearly every profession across the board is unparalleled to most ""top"" universities. However, it's just frustrating to think that the ""price we pay"" as transfers is missing out on the ""college experience"" and ultimately being left to fend for ourselves. 

What's funny is I've met a couple of people(also transfers) in the same position as myself, and many of them have just accepted the fact that they've simply missed the window of opportunity to make friends as transfers. I just think that's really shitty and people shouldn't feel a need to compromise. 

I'm really trying to plan out my course of action for the next semester(rushing, applying for frats/orgs) so I don't miss out on some like last year so if any of you have recommendations for me that would be greatly appreciated. Also I'd like to hear opinions or personal stories regarding transfers adjusting to USC. Again, in the greater scheme of things, I'm just thankful to attend this wonderful school and I'm just someone who wants to make the best of their Trojan experience.

However... I have also met some of the worst professors I have met in my entire education career. It honestly feels like some long con joke with the kinds of things these professors pull in class. Floating somewhere along the top 10 ranked engineering schools, I would assume the faculty staff keep a certain level of standards. However, out of the few graduate courses I have taken, most of them were pretty underwhelming. The lectures consist of basic, bare bone material that almost makes you question why we are spending so much time talking about it. The tests that are roughly 30% of your grade consists of some basic question that you could‚Äôve easily looked up on the wiki page of a given topic. The reason tests are difficult is because they‚Äôre are hundreds of small, random useless facts you‚Äôre expected to memorize. I‚Äôve had undergraduate courses that tested for a more in depth concepts.

I am not trying to say Viterbi is a shit college, but I will say I‚Äôm pretty disappointed in it and honestly a little less impressed when I hear someone has a masters degree. Am I the only one that feels this way?"

Any LoL fans wanting to find a community?,7,10,2017-11-29 03:15:58,"Open to graduate or undergraduate students!

USC Legends is a new upcoming club based out USC Games. For upperclassmen, this club is a bit different than previous League related organizations because USC Legends will be

1.  Officially recognized by Riot
2.  Actively participating in collegiate tournaments
3.  Host League of Legends themed events from casual, themed game tournaments to cosplay events, food outings, viewing parties and more.
4.  Seeking sponsorship from notable companies and local alumni*

So number 4 is probably the most unique. The end goal of this club is to rival UC Irvine's esport program which features their own official coach, transportation, swaggy jackets and a mini LCS studio to host tournaments of their own. Of which will not be a problem as long as we can have the numbers to show that this is a worthwhile investment thanks to our adviser's network.

Joining as a player or casual member will be an exciting opportunity to help the club grow and take advantage of all the connections willing to help us out!

Membership will always be free!

Contact usclegends@gmail.com if you're interested in joining our collegiate team gearing up to join the 2018 Season of Riot's College League of Legends tournament pitting schools across the country against each other for a few thousand dollars in prize money.

Players must be good mannered, fulltime students of USC and open to devoting time to practice and playing on game days. Big plus if you have a streamable personality ;)"

I am a freshman who had preemptively signed up for a third level foreign language course at my college. I had never taken a class for that language, neither in high school nor in my college. It was not available at my high school, so I took Latin instead (it might not count). Thus, I hoped that my placement test score would be high enough to allow me to take it. Obviously, I did not get the results that I wanted from the test. I will probably be forced to drop the course, though I do not know how my college will do so. In that case, I would have to replace it with either the lowest level course for that language or another course that fulfills a different transfer requirement. I might not have the chance to replace that course since classes start next week and I might not have room in my course schedule or the classes are full. If I have not taken a third level foreign language course by the time I submit the transfer application, how badly would that affect my chances of admission? If I do get forced to drop the course, should I go for a lower level language course or meet a different transfer requirement?

In terms of transfer requirements, I have met The Arts, Humanistic Inquiry (two courses), The Life Sciences, Quantitative Reasoning, Traditions and Historical Foundations, and Citizenship in a Diverse World. In terms of Social Analysis, I took a course about Global Affairs, not International Relations (I thought they were the same). That course focused more on economics rather than social analysis. I am also taking another Social Analysis related course this semester. I am listing these because I am not sure what requirement I should meet in light of my test results."

* The Village. Usually no one in there besides the workers, and there's quilted (yes, quilted) toilet paper. Most toilets on campus only have single, or if you're lucky, 2-ply TP. 
* Fertitta Hall. Lots of stalls and pretty clean. That speaks to the professionalism of our business school. 
* TCC. Similar to Fertitta Hall in its cleanliness and usually not too busy. Worst case is that you have a high school tourist that tries to make conversation about the life on campus at the stall or urinal (makes sense since tours start at TCC). 
* RTH. Very nice floors to look at while sitting on the throne. Usually pretty good except for socially autistic Viterbi students.

The worst places to poop, in my opinion, are:
* KAP. Reminds me of my high school gym's bathroom. Really dated tiles that can be sticky. Has a noticeable stench too.
* Doheny and Leavey. Probably a more personal thing to me, but hearing the various sounds of the bathroom can be disturbing after/while studying in a quiet atmosphere.

I'm legitimately confused as to why this happens to me but this is the second time in a row. 

So last semester during finals week I thought I had gotten sick with some sort of virus/bacteria infection that messed up my stomach really badly whenever I went to the bathroom(literally just fucking Niagara Falls everytime) and gave me really bad hot and cold flashes. Now I thought that this was a one time occurrence. I probably got unlucky and got sick from someone or something I ate. Still made it unbearable during all of my finals. But then second semester rolls around and I'm doing all fine when I get hit again with some of these chorros of waste, namely the bathroom one again. So now I'm starting to think ""shit"" someone at the dining hall didn't wash their hands or something, and may have gotten me or others sick as well. I only eat dining hall food btw. I'm wondering if anyone else has gotten sick this past week just for curiosity as this is concerning me. 

-I also remember that an outbreak like this isn't new as there was at the beginning of this semester at my residence building. But idk it may be from stress from finals week that has given me this again."

bmqby8,https://www.reddit.com/r/USC/comments/bmqby8/some_housing_tipsrecs_from_a_freshman/,Some Housing Tips/Recs from a Freshman!,41,10,2019-05-09 15:33:39,"Hi all! To all the new freshman admits, congrats and welcome! USC is THE place to be. I'm finishing up my 2nd semester here at USC and thought it'd be nice to give a little bit of breakdown of the different housing options that you have for your first semester in college. I remember being so confused about different dorm names and wanting to know more about the different cultures of each dorm. 

Here are my personal top three dorm recommendations:

**Birnkrant** - If you're looking for a social dorm experience, BK is where it's at. Not only is it socially-active, it's also generally cleaner than other social dorms like New North. BK is also located in the center of campus, so going to class won't be a trek. The campus Starbucks is right under, and Leavey library is literally steps away from the entrance. Birnkrant is a good middle ground between Mccarthy and New North.


**Parkside A&amp;H** - I'm honestly so happy I chose to live in 'Parkside Darkside'. Even though it has a rep for being socially dead and quiet (to a certain extent, true), if you're the type of person who wants to come home to a quiet and clean building after class, Parkside is the way to go. The suites are SUPER nice and spacious, we have cleaners who clean your private bathrooms, and the best campus dining hall is right here too! One of the main things that turns people off about PRB is the distance from classes. PRB is great if you're in Viterbi or Roski, but for someone who has all of their classes in Marshall (me), walking 15 minutes everyday can be a bother.


**Pardee** - Pardee tower is another solid choice. It's also located conveniently near most classes and in the middle of campus. Pardee is pretty social, you'll be able to find cool people on your floor for sure. There's also a business community floor in Pardee, which is something cool to look into if you're in Marshall. Pardee has spacious study rooms, but the rooms are pretty much the same size / vibe as the other residential buildings.


TIPS / REMINDERS:

McCarthy is only for Presidential and above scholarship students. If you put mccarthy as your housing options and you're not a scholarship recipient, you will be reassigned to a random building. One of my suitemates made this mistake, so don't put it down as your first three preferences!


Find a compatible roommate. You don't want to be stuck living with a randomly assigned roommate you don't end liking. Go join the USC 2023 facebook group, post a profile, and find someone you vibe with. Use online resources / apps like RentHoop - it's like a Tinder for roommates - to be more upfront about your 'dealbreakers' in housemates. 


GET DINING DOLLARS. the dining hall food will get old FAST! Dining dollars will save your hungry self when you're not in the mood for more overcooked EVK chicken. There are so many other food options on campus - Lemonade, Panda Express, Habit Burger - and dining dollars will most definitely help you out later in the year.


Again, congrats on your acceptances and good luck!"
bpkuhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/USC/comments/bpkuhh/to_all_prospective_marshall_students_who_care/,To all prospective Marshall students who care about their GPA...,29,23,2019-05-16 18:12:33,"Here's what you're getting into. Marshall keeps everything really secretive but after taking Marshall courses, here's some of the breakdowns for the classes I've taken.

My first class: Microeconomics Econ 351x
Top 21 to top 40% will get an A-. Top 20% will get a solid A in the class. Average is curved to a solid B or a little higher than a solid B. Good. That's doable.


Second class: Macroeconomics ECON 352x Top 11 to 20% will get an A-. Top 10% will get a solid A. Still reasonable but definitely not easy to get a solid A.

Third class: business statistics BUAD 310
Top 6 to 10% get an A-. Top 3% get a solid A. Okay now that's definitely not easy. This class also had homework and groupwork graded which brought basically everyone's grade up a little, making it even harder to ""separate yourself from the pack"". Out of 128 kids, 4 kids got a solid A. 

While I'm sure the distribution is different for each class taught by different professors, I don't think they'd vary widely from this. I hope this helps you all realize what you're getting into and what it takes to get a solid A. People who say these classes are easy are right in terms of getting B's. But they are dead wrong when it comes to getting solid A's. Top 3% for an A in business statistics... think about that for a minute. 

Good luck, Marshall students."

I'm an incoming MSW student (26M) currently living in the valley but looking to move somewhere closer to campus around August. I'm hoping to find 1-3 other grad students to share a house with. Just to be completely up front, though, I have three dogs and a cat. They're house trained and friendly, and I will never expect my housemates to share the responsibility of taking care of them. That being said, though, if you aren't a fan of animals, it's probably not the best match.

My monthly rent budget maxes out at around $2000, but the ideal would be around $1000ish (which looks pretty doable from what I've seen). I don't have a particular location in mind. As long as the place is within a 30 minute driving distance from USC and has a yard, I'm down to live anywhere with anyone. 

As for me, I'm a pretty chill, liberal guy. I'm clean and on top of my chores. I work out, game, binge TV shows, and enjoy the hell out of a good nap.

If I'm ever going to do something that'll affect the people I live with, I'll be sure to give everyone a heads up and make sure they're comfortable with it.

The first time I tried to go to college, I dropped out.  I was trying to go to school full-time, but after I registered and began classes, things took a turn for the worst.  One thing after the next, I lost my mother and in turn, my home (I've never met my father, so I couldn't turn to him for help), and I had nothing.  I was 18 and I was living out of my car/church.  I've always wanted to go to college; specifically, a SoCal uni (since around 6th grade).  I wanted to be able to become qualified in a field where I could find work that I loved and wouldn't have to decrease job opportunities because I didn't have a college education.  I tried to prevail, but barely being able to keep my head above water, I finished with a 2.0 GPA.  The next semester, I dropped out completely.

&amp;#x200B;

Two years later, I'm in a much better place financially and know now that I can focus on school without having to jeopardize my mental nor financial health.  I've healed and my mindset is completely different.  I am also now maintaining a 3.8 GPA, I am involved with my junior college's newspaper and volunteer at my local food bank twice a week.  I know that USC Admissions focuses on academics a lot and I was wondering if I had a chance of being accepted.  What are the odds that they would see my past and hold it against me even though (upon transferring, it would have been) more than 2 years and over 50 credit hours ago?"

All of you guys helped me out a lot and made me feel confident that I could join a tailgate and experience a new sport culture.
On Saturday I went to Trojan Liquor, a liquor store close to the USC campus and got some German beer to share with people. I wanted to give back a part of my culture as well. So I got the beer and made my way towards the campus In hopes of finding a tailgate to join. While I walked down the street I met some really cool seniors that instantly invited me to their tailgate and said that i could just stick with them and they'll show me what tailgating is all about. I was playing beer pong, doing beer bongs and meeting so many new people. It was fantastic! After that we went to the game and as I entered the stadium i was starstruck. I've never seen such a big stadium, I've been to a lot of sports events in Europe but this was huge. I enjoyed it! The game was really intense until USC started to destroy Stanford. After the game i was able to grab some pictures with some players as well. It was great! I spent the rest of the night at a bar called ""901"". The bar was great!

I would love to hear your experiences.

Do you think there's an epidemic of loneliness, depression, and anxiety on college campuses?

Do you think its worse on USC's campus? If so, what could USC administration do to make it better? For example, long term on-campus counseling resources, etc.

Personally, I think high academic expectations play a huge role in this. Classes are becoming more and more difficult, and a lot of asking for help is considered cheating, which leaves students no where to ask questions unless they plan their schedule to attend the small window of office hours each week. I think it's also hard for students to make friends, especially after the initial few months of freshman year. USC's administration seems to take an ignorant view on all of this. They expect us to either walk through high-crime neighborhoods alone or pay for a Lyft to get to long-term counseling, and wait times for phone consults are often weeks long. Has anyone else had similar experiences? What are your views?"

Classrooms that are not large lecture halls are so overcrowded with chairs and students in a small and narrow room. I'm quite short so unless I'm at the front row 70% of my vision is obscured by other people's heads. And I dread ever having to seat at the far end of the class, since you can't see anything on the board due to the angle of the vision. 

Not that the lecture halls are any better, their chairs are often squeaky and desks are tiny (problematic when you have to take an exam in there) and some lecture halls are designed so poorly so that nobody can enter your row's seat unless you completely fold your desk. 

I also hate the chairs with wheels and tiny desks attached. Often the desks are way too small. A month ago I dropped my Surface from the tiny desk at VKC and it cracked my screen :(
And no one arranges the chairs so they're just clumped together in the back. Trying to wade thru the wheeled chairs to get to the empty seat is a chore.

Why don't we get a proper and ""stationary"" desk and a chair? It's not like we can actually make use of the wheels since we often don't even have any room to move around in a classroom.

I don't know why they're running out of size-appropriate classrooms with all the money we give them. USC administration is corrupt and lazy, taking all these fortune off students and not using it to invest in something that actually matters,  like classroom or desks."

It's not written in stone yet but I thought I'd create a discord server running so that I can talk with the potential members about how to get the momentum forward.

Trojans who are serious/passionate about food, do join the discord server and ask any questions.  [https://discordapp.com/invite/ffefunR](https://discordapp.com/invite/ffefunR) 

&amp;#x200B;

**About the (prospective) club:**

The club's at the conception stage and everything is subject to change, but I'm aiming for an informal network where Trojans can share their foodie experience (and food) and socialize. We will have some (mostly low maintenance) food-related events . We might have a potluck where everyone brings food and shares them.  Or a small picnic on campus. Near finals or midterm week we might just opt to go to KBBQ or huoguo or other ""large group"" restaurants so that we wouldn't have to worry about spending time to make food for other person. If we can manage to get a venue, it'd also be nice to get together and have a cook-off or cook together as well. I'm currently just looking for a small tight-knit group, since it'd be a lot of time and money organizing and hosting events for a large group of people. 

I'm not expecting the members to be a ""master chef"" (I myself is not really a good cook)but someone who loves cooking and food. However, I'd like the members to not be pickiest of picky eaters (this excludes dietary restrictions, food allergies and intolerance and religious restrictions) and appreciate food from different cultures. I'm also looking for someone who would at least keep tabs on the club and participate in the events from time to time.

A few individual have shown considerable interest in joining but right now it's just me with the idea. I'm looking for people who want to be in a council. If it gets traction we'll try to make the club officially recognized.

Even if it never gets on I like to talk about food so I wish this opportunity will bring a lot of foodies together so that they can share about the restaurants they love and other stuff."

dedekv,https://www.reddit.com/r/USC/comments/dedekv/does_anyone_else_feel_the_same_socially/,Does anyone else feel the same... socially?,21,7,2019-10-06 19:36:25,"Hi! I am currently a student at USC, and I transferred two years ago. I still feel very ambivalent about my experience at USC. However, I always knew it would be a struggle to come here because I always wanted to go to a women's college due to the fact I've always loved the intimacy of a small liberal arts college that would allow me to flourish in pursuing the humanities. However, I decided to go to USC because it was close to home, and it was significantly cheaper in the long-term since I want to pursue graduate school.  I do love my classes, professors, and the field of discipline I chose at USC. I honestly can't believe all the things I've done due to the prestige and resources that USC has offered. However, I can't help thinking to myself how socially lonely I am on campus. 

I guess for the time in my life, I am acknowledging that I am lonely on campus. My first year at USC was less than ideal, because I had some naive notion that all universities were progressive (and it wouldn't matter where I went for undergraduate because most student on-campus culture would be more-or-less the same), so I was starkly surprised about how social, how pre-professional-driven, how sporty (for a lack of a better word), and how superficial, and occasionally conservative USC could be at times. Most of the time, I ended up doing things most people wanted to do: go to parties. But, I felt really unsatisfied because I didn't feel like I made any meaningful relationships. . . just a bunch of acquaintances. Since the social scene is very centered around alcohol, I felt really weirdly acculturated into drinking all the time with friends and then by myself to deal with my stress (yay‚Ä¶alcoholism). I came from a pretty conservative family, so my first time drinking was at USC, and that didn't bode well with my family for a well. But, I have to admit that the time I did spend drinking out and going out with my then-girlfriends, I was very confident, assertive, and I was able to overcome a lot of my social phobias. It was the first time I did very extroverted things, including exploring my sexuality and autonomy. 

By the time it was my second year, as I was starting to narrow down what I was interested in academically and professionally, as a result of being very indecisive of my future (but who isn't?), I was still being invited to parties or kickbacks centered around alcohol. And, I started to distance myself from those invites and ended feeling excluded. I am not sure if people were doing this on purpose, but all my acquaintances I met from partying ended up not transitioning well into meaningful relationships. So, I ended up feeling very lonely. However, I also felt very liberated like I mentioned earlier about overcoming particular social phobias/anxieties and realizing what made me happy socially. I came to the conclusion that I've always been an introvert, so I enjoy being alone and being able to engage with my schoolwork intensely. 

But, I couldn't help but think I felt like an outsider. There would be times where I went to birthday parties/outings and felt really pressured to drink to socialize with a bunch of people I didn't know and listen to people talk about designer items, fancy vacations, and a lot of things that honestly didn't interest me. And, it made me feel uncomfortable that I drank too much, so I could dissociate from people.

Even this semester, I was invited multiple times to go out, and I would find some excuse to decline because it just wasn't fun to be around drunk people or people who I couldn't form a deeper bond. Even in the last few semesters, I also tried to go to esoteric talk series on campus, polymathic pizzas, and other more ""intellectual"" things, because I did genuinely want to pursue more thoughtful, genuine, and kind friends who were interested in seeing how their academic interests could translate into purposeful work post-grad. However, I felt like people already had their friend groups, and I was ‚Ä¶ alas‚Ä¶always late when it came to entering a solid friend group.

It sucks feeling lonely. I have friends still who will send me articles or share me internship opportunities or share very intimate/deep things, but we don't really hang out daily, which is something I really want where I can spontaneously go to a museum or a film screening with someone. 

I theorized this for a while, and I wonder if anyone feels the same about this? USC student culture makes such a massive effort to market this imagery of constant socialization that even authentic, regular socialization can't compare to the artificial depiction of it. Like, if I had gone to any other university that had a serious student studying culture, I think I would be very social. But, having gone to such a university with a substantial social scene dominated by partying and going out, I feel really insecure about how I should socialize with other people. I value a lot of things that don't seem compatible with most people on campus. 

Also, to add, there are times I like USC because of USC's size and breadth of the opportunities and diversity, but sometimes I feel like when you deconstruct what USC offers‚Ä¶there are still a lot of things missing‚Ä¶ and it is hard to advocate for courses/fields that never existed at USC. For instance, I am a first-generation Southeast Asian woman, and I don't get to meet many students from my background. I wish I could meet more students like me? But, just me feels like I have to be the token student of color to explain to wealthy domestic and international students some water-down version of how I got to USC (minus the financial + academic struggles because nobody is interested in listening). There are times I met people who are so wealthy that seeing students transferring 20k+ between bank accounts might be normal to them but so shocking to me. Or, meeting international students from other countries whose parents are so rich/important that people have casually dropped in the conversation that their parent is some diplomatic ambassador, higher up executive, or CEO that it honestly feels like a huge culture shock. 

So, I am not sure?  I feel ambivalent about USC. Have I gone anywhere else, I don't think I would be the person I am today. But, have I gone anywhere else, I think I would be more socially happy in a university with a different student culture that centered around partying and/or obsequious display of wealth. I never really thought about student culture until today, but I thought I would share with current and prospective students my ambivalence toward USC. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I like USC, but I also don't like USC. I'm ambivalent about my school. Socially, I feel isolated. But, my experience at USC has been so great academically. I love my classes and professors. I love being able go to office hours and casually talk to my professors about my thoughts and ideas, and I love how small my classes are in the humanities. But, there are things I wish could change about USC where the social scene isn't dominated by partying, so maybe I could form some meaningful relationships before I graduate.

\---

Also, after writing this, I feel a lot better, because I might be ""lonely,"" but I don't feel insecure about who I am or what I stand for in values and beliefs if that makes sense? I am selective about my energy and time, but I wish USC had a different social scene. At this point, I hope I can make more genuine and meaningful relationships before I graduate. Otherwise, I'll continue to focus my time and energy to my studying and other commitments outside USC."

The maximum you can get from this is $6,195. 

https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/caresactgrantfundingcoverletterfinal.pdf

This isn't a USC thing and would apply at any school eligible for federal aid. But implementation is up to each and every university. 

""As you know, the CARES Act provides several different methods for distributing roughly $14
billion in funds to institutions of higher education. The most significant portion of that funding
allocation provides that $12.56 billion will be distributed to institutions using a formula based on
student enrollment. Of the amount allocated to each institution under this formula, at least 50
percent must be reserved to provide students with emergency financial aid grants to help cover
expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to coronavirus. We are prioritizing
this funding stream in order to get money in the hands of students in need as quickly as possible. ""

""The CARES Act provides institutions with significant discretion on how to award this
emergency assistance to students. This means that each institution may develop its own system
and process for determining how to allocate these funds, which may include distributing the
funds to all students or only to students who demonstrate significant need. The only statutory
requirement is that the funds be used to cover expenses related to the disruption of campus
operations due to coronavirus (including eligible expenses under a student‚Äôs cost of attendance,
such as food, housing, course materials, technology, health care, and child care). With that said, I
would like to encourage the leadership of each institution to prioritize your students with the
greatest need, but at the same time consider establishing a maximum funding threshold for each
student to ensure that these funds are distributed as widely as possible. As a point of reference,
you might consider using the maximum Federal Pell grant (for the 2019-2020 academic year,
$6,195) as that threshold. In addition, if you determine that your institution‚Äôs students do not
have significant financial need at this time, I would ask that you consider giving your allocation
to those institutions within your state or region that might have significant need."""

I'm currently attending an LACCD college and am in a bit of a tight spot. I'm taking a class, Discrete Structures, and am majoring in Computer Science (Game Development). Though I've yet to receive an acceptance, USC is my no. 1 and I want to get in more than anything in the world.

The problem? That one class. With the sudden transition to online, everything's chaotic. 

This class has caused me tremendous stress and I want to drop it so I don't keep having panic and anxiety attacks.  The professor has not taught us anything and has only communicated with us ONCE after we made the online transition. We have our midterm in May that I doubt I'll be passing-- I don't have the time to sit down and read through the text, unfortunately, because of my other classes.

My question, after all that rambling, is: How will my dropping of this class affect my ability to get in? I know dropping it will leave an EW on my transcript and I don't want to drop a class I desperately need, but the mental strain is killing me and I'm having trouble deciding if it's worth it.

2. I've heard you can meet people at Lorenzo - it's a bit expensive to get your own place there. Also heard that it's mainly partying international undergrads? Any views on Icon, West 27th place, Tuscany?

3. What would be the best way to find roommates and generally meet people as a grad student?

Thank you!"

Instead,

1. CSCI 201, 310 and 401: One class is enough, we don't need 3 SE classes that are basically PPT memorization and one man doing all team's work. Most other universities with a strong CS program don't make their students take 3 SE classes. These classes likely won't make you a better programmer, internships will.
2. CSCI 356/CSCI 310 always full: The situation is especially true for CSCI 310, as I have heard complaints after complaints about difficulties of getting into these classes. CSCI 356 in other universities is usually taken in the first semester of sophomore year, why in hell should students who pay $$$ wait till end of junior year to take a system intro class?
3. Lack of breadth on technical electives: most CS majors I know like to take ITP classes to fulfill their technical electives. Why? The computer science department offers very few choices for upper-division classes. Classes like database are grad-level classes that are only offered for certain semesters, but these are really basic upper-div classes that are regularly offered in other universities.

End of rant.

Edit: Wow! I didn‚Äôt think that this post would be this controversial. I appreciate everyone‚Äôs comment. Some people have pointed out that school itself should not revolve around job preparation, and I agree with that point. I‚Äôm not being dismissive of the fact that these SE classes aren‚Äôt representative of what I experienced in internships, but the fact that SE classes are filling the curriculum in a way that squeaks out the theory classes. The same issue with the upper-divs: ITP classes are industry-based application classes. If this rant has a TLDR, it would be: Viterbi is leaning too pre-professional to deliver a degree that is supposed to be about science instead of pure engineering."

One way to meet alums is to try and connect with them over Instagram. Simply search your specific school departments geotag and you‚Äôll find a bunch of people who just graduated or are marketing something professional in your field and school. I like the post, congratulate them, send them a dm informing them who I am and professionally ask if I can ask them a few questions about their experiences within the university. Not only has every person I connected with been super open and kind, but I have even further connected with them by opening up communication where we are now added on LinkedIn and they have informed me I can come to them to ask questions/discuss topics in our field.

July 14, 2020


Dear Students,

Many of you have reached out to us with financial concerns about the coming year. This pandemic has uprooted so many lives and created so much economic devastation in our communities. The challenges are real, and we are doing our best to address your concerns and to keep up with an evolving situation.

For most of you, it has been difficult to plan for the year ahead without knowing where you will be living in the fall. With COVID cases on the rise in Los Angeles, there continues to be uncertainty in our fall plans, and we realize that is a particular challenge to students receiving financial aid.

As explained in our recent letters on aid packages, we did not include room and board costs yet, because we cannot calculate your total financial aid package until your housing plans are finalized.

We are addressing these expenses now and your full package will be adjusted to cover room and board once your housing plans are finalized, in the following ways:
 

Students who would have received financial aid for room and board, but who have decided to live at home due to COVID ‚Äì will receive an Undergraduate Living-at-Home Scholarship in the amount of $4,000 for the fall semester and $4,000 for the spring semester if you remain at home.

Students who plan to continue living in USC housing ‚Äì we are in close communication with the Housing office and will automatically increase your financial aid award to the maximum amount based on need. For those who have chosen to cancel their contracts, we have already refunded everyone‚Äôs confirmation fee ($800). For those students who are considering cancelling their contracts, they may do so at any time and your full application fee ($55) will be refunded.

Students in non-USC (off-campus) housing who are not living with parents or relatives ‚Äì will receive an increase in cost of attendance and financial aid award once you provide necessary documentation (rental or lease agreement). Your financial aid award will automatically be increased to the maximum amount based on need. Many of you have already submitted your documentation, and we are working hard to process your award.

Thank you for your patience as we re-process thousands of financial aid packages. Our goal is to have these updates completed by August 3 for students in confirmed USC housing and those who have submitted their non-USC rental or lease agreement by July 24.

Another financial concern we want to address involves your technology needs, including connecting online and accessing a computer. If you need help in these areas, please contact Student Basic Needs at basicneeds@usc.edu. They can assist with WiFi access and/or loan laptops to students in need.

We‚Äôre all in this together, as one Trojan Family. We are listening to your concerns and will be in touch with updates as we have them. In the meantime, information can be found on the Financial Aid site. Please stay safe and well.

Sincerely,
Thomas McWhorter, Dean of Financial Aid"

i'm taking molecular bio (BISC320) and 2 other major required courses, so it seems like my courseload will be on the heavier side already. prof swain already said that this class will require 4-6 hr/week of work (and maybe even more for me since idk how to use figma and know much abt UX design)

At the very least, we'd be back for the Fall, right? Well, we all quickly realized how unrealistic that was, and accepted that the start of Fall would be online. And then we accepted that all of Fall would be online. Now we're on the same timeline, in the process of accepting that Spring will be online too.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite this, I still see people saying that we will be back in-person for next semester.  People taking about spring break. People making plans to move-in around campus.

&amp;#x200B;

It's very, very unlikely there will be in-person functions (classes or otherwise) at USC next semester. I know, it sucks. But let's be realistic here. The soonest a vaccine is going to be done with all of its trials and approved is around the end of this year, and it won't produced is the beginning of next year.  It will be at least a couple more months after that until it's widely accessible, and several more months until we have reached widespread immunity. If you watch or read the news, even the most optimistic sources are saying late 2021 for real herd immunity.

&amp;#x200B;

So stop making the same mistakes last semester. Don't sign any more leases. Don't book any more flights. And DEFINITELY don't make any plans for any kind of 'spring break'. Stop setting yourself up for disappointment. If you just accept now that next semester will be online, then at least you have the possibility of getting a nice surprise if there is some in-person stuff. But if you still think that you'll be back in the Spring, you've got a long road of disappointment ahead of you."

Not going to lie, I am still burnt out and overwhelmed by everything related to school. I go to lecture crying time to time (thank god I have my camera turned off), and cannot sleep well, due to the anxiety this entire year has created. For this reason, I‚Äôve thought about taking a break next semester and coming back next Fall, when all this bs is over (hopefully) but now I‚Äôm conflicted. I think it‚Äôs important to mention that I am a transfer junior and part of the reason why I chose USC is to have the ‚Äúcollege experience‚Äù and obviously enrich my education. But I also wanted to feel as if I belong somewhere, and thought USC would be the school to make me feel at home. Now due to the pandemic, nothing has been going the way I hoped it would be. Prior to this mess, I‚Äôve been imagining myself stepping foot on campus, socializing with fellow Trojans, going to big lecture halls...all the typical college stuff! But thanks to COVID, I‚Äôm stuck at home isolated, all alone. I feel disillusioned. The only thing I‚Äôve been doing is arguing with my mom because I don‚Äôt know who to let my frustrations out on. And obviously I feel terrible doing this to her, but I‚Äôm helpless! And she just doesn‚Äôt get it! As pathetic as it may seem, I practically have no friends. I was forced to end my friendship with my best friend two years ago because my mom didn‚Äôt like him. He was my only friend at the time, and now I have no one. Unfortunately, I was not able to make connections at my previous institution because I felt unwanted there. I didn‚Äôt feel a sense of belonging and it wasn‚Äôt the type of environment I was looking for. Because of this, i chose to transfer to USC. I wanted to change things for the better, and make things right for myself. But I‚Äôm still back to square one: lonely, miserable, and helpless. On top of that, there‚Äôs school to worry about. I have to give up my weekends just to be on top of things. My mental health is at an all time low. I‚Äôve realized that loneliness and school do not mesh well. Considering the state of my well-being, it seems to make sense to take an LOA. But at the same time, I want to move out and build friendships with other Trojans, rather than to wait another semester to make friends. I feel that if I‚Äôm not as lonely, I‚Äôll at least be happy. But I‚Äôm still not sure what to do. Should I continue to take online classes, but move out, make friends and be a happier person, or should I take a leave and come back mentally stable next Fall?"

I've been checking out the CS course plan and it's pretty confusing in terms of requirements. To any Viterbi comp sci majors out there - do you know if physics is a required class? Can I satisfy the GE and Basic Sciences requirement with just Chem and Bio? I absolutely despise physics and am considering taking an AP exam to get out of taking the course if necessary (but am really hoping it doesn't come down to that).

On your resume, being from this exclusive club isn‚Äôt going to matter more. As a student, I just want to learn and get hands-on experience. Guess I have to go intern somewhere else again. Shout out to the small number of clubs that actually offer free events. (Y‚Äôall are the best) But wow the vast majority of Marshall orgs aren‚Äôt catering to curious students who just want to learn. It‚Äôs a goddamn popularity contest and those clich√©d cliques. I call B.S on ‚Äúit‚Äôs all about fit.‚Äù That‚Äôs what they say in info sessions when they clearly base your entire personality on a few words during the interviews.

I and a few other people had it enough, and we want an **inclusive community**, so everyone can have **access to the resources** if they want them.

Anyway, if anyone here is interested in business roles in the tech industry, check out **Techie** ([techie\_usc](https://instagram.com/techie_usc) and [apply here](https://linktr.ee/techieusc)). This semester we will have guest speakers who work for **Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft**, etc. It will be a great opportunity to network. And as long as you send the application (due tomorrow at 8 PM), **you are in**. We also still need few board members - Director of Finance, Director of HR, and Director of Operations if anyone is interested.

Mods, I hope this is not in violation of the #1 rule regarding the promotions (I didn't see the clubs included there).

I have been doing a lot of research for the TTP and just wanted to thank everyone who has given any information regarding this as there really isn't that much information about it. I just had a few questions regarding this topic.  


1. The first question I had was if AP Classes taken in high school would suffice for any of the units required for the TTP.
2. My next question is regarding housing. I've heard from some TTP students that USC doesn't have that much for students on the TTP regarding housing and I just wanted to hear some of your experiences with that.
3. My last question is the most objective one but probably the one that I am wondering about the most. Is the freshman experience worth the hassle of going to a 4-year institution?   
So far, I have come down to 4 choices of what school I should go to prior to USC and these have been a UC (UC Davis), a state school (SJSU), a school on the east coast (Northeastern), and of course community college. I plan on transferring into the Marshall school of business so the 3.6-3.8 GPA range is quite daunting for me. I just wanted to hear what you all should think I should do here, assuming that I am fortunate enough to not worry about the cost.

It doesn't help that the prices are identical for both.

My current major will be Business Administration at Marshall, however I really want to have a technical/quantitative background. I was thinking about the Viterbi major CSBA, yet I heard it's a broad major on both CS and Business, making it difficult to be taken seriously in future careers as they will think you lack both the managerial and technical skills. I was thinking if I pursue my undergrad as a BA (Business Administrator) and a Master in CS, it would be hard. However, if I do my undergrad as a CS major or Computer Engineering &amp; Computer Science then continue onto an MBA, that seems much more reasonable. 

Please help me with all your insight and if you know anyone in the same circumstance that switched majors. I know it's not hard to switch as long as you contact your academic advisor and to begin your pre-engineering track.

I was ADMITTED into Dorsnire

Dream: become a billionaire tech entrepreneur. At SC I would also take Film classes for fun (not a reason to go, just a bonus).

Biggest CONS:

SIZE (less prof-student relationships, harder to find friends, worse advising compared to CMC). I go to a HS with &lt;200 kids so it would be a big jump up.

ACADEMICS. I am absolutely looking for a strong liberal arts education--I enjoy learning for fun and want to study what I'm passionate about (not quiet as focused as majoring in something marketable, but I'm def thinking about it!). It's simply not as academically focused as the other 2 schools.

INTELLECTUAL. I also want to be around intellectual people, and I feel like there may be less of this here.

SOCIALLY. I am NOT crazy about greek life (but might join if I \*have\* to), Again I'm more academic and SC is more of a ""party school""--but still academically strong I know.

&amp;#x200B;

PROS: Location (proximity to things to do--but not sure if SC students often go off campus), flexibility in academics, NETWORK, start up culture?, and some school spirit would be nice

NOTE: I Do NOT care about Greek Life, sports, and all of that. I'm mainly focused on academics, getting out of my comfort zone, and using college as a stepping stone.

I was admitted to USC for Pharmacology and Drug Development with a Transfer Merit Scholarship, which covers 1/4 tuition. The financial aid package seems to be generous enough, considering my EFC is 0, so tuition is fully covered with some money leftover for other expenses. I might have to pay about $10,000 per year out-of-pocket for housing and food. The school also offers a program in conjunction with this major that, if completed, will give me priority consideration for USC School of Pharmacy (pharmacy is my ultimate goal). However, USC SOP is expensive as shit, so I have no idea how I could possibly afford it even with scholarships and loan forgiveness programs are not set in stone yet. Note: I spent most of my life and currently live in SoCal, about 30 min from USC.

On the other hand, I was admitted to Cal for Molecular and Cell Biology. The financial aid was indeed generous and fully covers my tuition, housing, food, and other essential student fees with about $1,000-$3,000 left over per year (for living expenses). This does not yet include two scholarships I recently applied for which amount to $9,000 per year in total. Also, I could always aim for UCSF Pharmacy School, which is ranked higher than USC SOP and costs much less. However, my Berkeley major MCB is notoriously difficult, especially if you are premed (which I am not), though I am trying to maintain an overall GPA of 3.5-3.6 (my CC gpa is &gt;3.8 so I‚Äôm aiming for my Cal GPA to be around 3.0-3.4 to balance it out), which would be considered competitive for pharmacy school. I‚Äôm also worried about burnout, competition, and not finding research opportunities.

Which school should I attend?

i've been committed to usc since late april, but just got an offer to attend duke instead and i'm torn. my intended major is something in economics, public policy, political economy - or some combination thereof - with the intent of going to law school.¬†

i've always liked duke as a school (for a while it was my dream until i kind of shifted some perspectives), but usc is a newer idea for me. i've grown up in a small southern town quite similar to durham, and have never lived in a big city, though i know i really want to. in that sense, usc is a big culture shift of the kind i've always wanted, while duke makes it easier to stay close to home.¬†

what draws me to duke is the law school placement rates; the quality of study abroad, both domestic and international (such as duke engage and duke in new york); research opportunities; the tight knit community; and the research / alumni connections.

what worries me about duke is the greek life scene, the sports culture, and the fact that durham is a college town. despite it being in the research triangle, i want to feel connected to a city or an area beyond a bubble of a campus.¬†

what i like about usc is the variety of majors and schools; the location in la; the research; the size and variety of the student body; and the chance to start over and take a big step in some sense. i also like their maymesters and stuff like the schaefer fellows, global fellows in asia intern program, etc

what worries me about usc is the size, the wealth culture, and cost (i'm on good fin aid at both, but it's about 8k more per year than duke, and i know cost of living could increase that). i also feel like since i don't have a ton of money to burn, i wouldn't have as a good a time in la and i know transportation is hard without a car, which i don't have. i also know duke would likely be better for law school, so i'm not sure about that.

to be honest, i feel like it could be cool to take my chances at usc and spread my wings, but that may be me kinda romanticizing it. ¬†at the same time though, it's hard for me to pass up duke and the opportunities it offers.

so yeah, that's my predicament. i know i'm super lucky to be in this spot, and i'm grateful to you all for taking the time to read. any advice would be appreciated, especially from anyone who's experienced usc and could give me an honest review. tysm!!!"

\-Troy Hall  
\-University Gateway 

So far my friends have said gateway but I have also seen a lot of bad things about gateway. I think USC put this option on the housing app because they were so short on housing.


UPDATE: We went with gateway. From pictures it looks newer and nicer with more amenities. We got a high floor 6th floor and my roommate says it was much quieter. 

I know there are a lot of complaints about gateway but a lot of people do live there and most people will voice complaints over compliments. Most people I know irl have not had negative experiences at gateway.

The thing that drove me away from cargar was just that it looked too old. There are also stories of burglaries and hate crimes happening which I‚Äôm sure can happen anywhere but I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs not perfect the same way gateways probably isn‚Äôt perfect.

If anything I think Lorenzo looks the nicest with the most amenities but I don‚Äôt want to have to take a shuttle every time I want to go on campus.

I‚Äôm a transfer student who recently moved on campus a few days ago. I‚Äôm a pretty extroverted person and love hanging out with people and going out, especially city night life.

For whatever reason tho, I‚Äôm having trouble finding people at USC.

My roomate is super nice but he is pretty Introverted and doesn‚Äôt seem to talk very much or want to introduce me to any of his friends. 

Anyone else out there feel similarly? I would love to chat with some USC people and make some new friends! I‚Äôm happy to just talk, explore LA, go thrifting, or go to the ‚Äúwelcome concert‚Äù tonight and have a good time. 

Anyway, feel free to PM me and we can trade snap/insta or something :)"

I recently had Packers Hall of Famer and USC Alum Ken Ruettgers on my podcast. He mostly talked football and told great stories about Reggie White and pranking Brett Favre with icy hot in his kick strap etc. Later in the interview, we talked about his wife who recently suffered serious neurological injuries from the vaccine. 

Ken has a PhD, is pro science, and isn't anti-vax. At times we were even complimentary of vaccine technology and agreed we need to get to herd immunity with the vaccine.

However, 48 hours later, our episide was pulled from youtube and our channel was threatened for ""medical misinformation"" - no further explanation was given. They provided no timestamps of the alleged misinformation. I went back and listened from the perspective of a ""fact checker"" there truly was no misinformation. It's a concerning day when you're not allowed to tell your own factual story anymore of family members being harmed by a product. 

Luckily the episide is still up on iTunes, spotify, pandora, etc. 

Obviously I want people to listen to the podcast but more importantly I'm open to feedback on what was said wrong in this episode that constituted ""medical misinformation.""

I am an international student who just moved from upstate New York to Los Angeles. So it‚Äôs a long story, and it all started when me and my boyfriend decided to help some other new international students to settle when they arrive Los Angeles for the first time. Over the last couple weeks, due to the fact thats school and a lot of student organizations stopped offering airport pick-up service, a lot of other international students who are just like me but are arriving in the states for the first time, are facing the challenges of communicating with locals (because some drivers, shop assistants might get impatient and yelled at them and got them freak out), finding and getting keys to their apartments, getting themselves settled, and even finishing the school requirement to start their first semester! Therefore, my boyfriend and I decided to help them out by picking them up from airport and settling them up for the first day in America. We were helping a couple students to get their mobile plan last week. It was weird when att staff were telling us att no longer offer prepaid plan and were forcing us to buy their post-paid. 8 years ago when I first came to America, my guardians helped me get my att prepaid plan. 4 years ago, when my boyfriend first arrived in New York, the att staff also forced him to buy the post-paid and offered him a $300 per month bill. I made him change to the prepaid plan when we first met. Just because we are USC international student who have to pay tuition in full, doesn‚Äôt mean that we are all rich people who think spending $300 is the same as spending $30. Anyways, I just wanna ask if att prepaid plan is really canceled in California as that‚Äôs what the USC att store staff told us. I am really suspicious because I was able to find prepaid plan on att website and helped the new girls got their prepaid plan eventually. Does anyone here recently buy a plan from the att store located in the DPS and was told California att no longer offers prepaid plan?"

One time I was face timing my girlfriend on my computer and I left for a little bit to go brush my teeth and my girlfriend caught him walking up to my computer and trying to get a look at what was on it. He's constantly pacing back and forth everywhere on his phone and not closing the door when he leaves the room. It especially makes me uncomfortable when he's just standing between the beds and just not doing anything. When he leaves the room and actually does close the door he slams it. I've only talked to him about one incident where I had my phone charger plugged in and he unplugged it to plug in his (yes my phone was charging). He also sprays his terrible-smelling cologne on in the middle between the two beds. I've also been woken up throughout the week at 7 am to him leaving the door open and clinking his utensils to his bowl when he eats (it's so loud). I haven't talked to him about a lot of stuff that bothers me, mostly because I hate confrontation and also that he just overall makes me feel uncomfortable. I really don't want to go to the RA about this and I mostly just want to get reassigned. I just wish my roommate was more considerate because when I leave the room I close it as I quietly can, I take calls outside the room, I go to the living room for more privacy, etc. He slams the door so hard that the room shakes. Does anyone know if I were to get assigned could I switch to a different room orientation because I'm currently in a 2b4p room but if possible I'd want to switch to a 2b2p loft."

(serious life advice needed),1,12,2021-09-16 11:29:45,"I'm seriously complementing dropping out, and never returning again because my mental health is horrible and I'm being emotionally harmed by the very people I thought were meant to aid me.

It's my first semester in person and so far it's been a shitshow for me because I've been trying to make friends, join clubs, make the best out of my experience here but it feels like no matter how much I try, it almost feels like I'm punished implicitly for attempting to make friends.

I specifically joined a special interest apartment (I couldn't get in the special interest floor but I'm in the same building as them) so that by doing so, it could probably ease the transition and I could have an easier time making friends. Suffice to say, this was probably one of the worst decisions and has actually made things worst for me emotionally. 

Yesterday there was a get together for the special interest group and since I'm not in it, I saw other people that aren't in that community but in the building also joined them. I asked some people if it would be okay to join given I'm in the building, a bunch of them just left me on read, two of them answered things along the lines of ""fuck off"" and one of them blocked me even though on my profile it's very clear I'm a USC student.

I felt extremely embarrassed at myself, I felt like a waste of space. I just wanted to express my sentiment towards them in the building group chat, that they were right: I am a waste of space and tell them that I was going to harm myself because of them, but then a bunch of people started arguing and targeting each other aggressively in the group chat for like over hour but that's besides the point.

Truthfully I've been a wreck even before this incident. I've been randomly breaking down on campus a couple of times in discrete areas where no one will see me. I feel like hurting myself a lot, or admittedly ending my life. 

I have severe anxiety and persistent depressive disorder, and I never felt this way in high school because I had large friend group that had me in comfort, made me feel a sense of self-worth, like I meant something to me and them, and in a way that helped me regulate the aforementioned disorders, helped me forget about the vertities of my disorders and I actually felt purpose in my life from being with others. 

Here I have nobody to talk to. I've been alone every single day here as a student, without any real friends at the least, and ever since I've moved in the prospect of being alone has exacerbated my disorders for me. I've been feeling extremely anxious, shortness of breath, mental breakdowns in my dorm. It hasn't come to self harming yet, but if I'm being honest I don't think it will be much longer before it gets to that point.

This is why I feel like dropping out. If I don't drop out, and I just continue being miserable, I'm honestly going to end up dead one way or another (and I'm not talking about suicide). I'm just intentionally hurting myself emotionally by being enrolled here. It's worthless trying to make friends, seeing others having the time of their lives in a frat party on Instagram or Snapchat, not being mentioned on missed connections for being a worthless lump of organic matter. I just wanna experience my first party with others, go to the beach with others, for the sake of my mental health, so that I don't succumb to my disorders.

I guess that's too much to ask apparently. 

I'm probably going to mention dropping out with my advisor tomorrow anyways. I can't handle the high probability of bring friendless and a loner all year, I'll definitely be dead if that were to happen."

I‚Äôve had a consultation and this will cost about 3k, so I thought I‚Äôd get it don‚Äôt cheaper at the dental school.  I signed up and went in for the first step of being admitted as a patient, which is a screening.  My student dentist was fine, no complaints there, but the students who took my X-rays were horrible.  They were giggling the entire time like it was a lab assignment, very very young, the process took an hour and a half when it should only take 15 minutes.  Dental X-rays are extremely uncomfortable, and by the end I was discouraged about the quality of treatment at the dental school to say the least.  By the end the instructor had to step in and finish the X-rays.  I‚Äôm worried about continuing, is the student dentist who‚Äôs going to perform oral SURGERY, going to display this level of inexperience?

I am currently entertaining the idea of making a pretty massive career pivot into IO Psych - although, I feel this field is genuinely \*custom-carved\* for my personality and my skills, so I think the transition will be smooth. That said, I'm leaving a very comfortable position and need to be sure that this is right for me so I don't want to fly blind - want to pursue getting my degree while working full time (from Philadelphia) to be sure I'm doing the right thing, as I'm sure I will be taking a relatively deep pay cut off the bat, at least at the start.

The eventual positions I am mostly attracted to/suited for are:

1. Applied social scientist
2. Personnel Psychologist
3. Human Capital Consultant
4. Leadership Experience Director

I want the \*squooshy\* jobs - talent development oriented, as opposed to the more data analytical track.

This program at SC is an expensive one - I am an alum and was upset to learn there was no credit for former students. So, that being said, I currently make approximately $165k and I know that there's no way I will earn that kind of money upon graduation, but I'm looking to pursue something I feel like I'm made to do, so as long as I'm not much below $100k so that I don't completely lose the lifestyle I've gained for 16 years, I am confident I will move up. I want to work in the private sector, corporations and whatnot

Without talking your ear off even more, does anyone here have any specific insights they can give me as a graduate of the program? This is a brand new thing for me and I don't know anyone in the field personally, so transparently I'm really relying on your insights...

Thanks so much

I started off in AMCM, then I switched to CSCI but didn't really enjoy 104, plus I don't see myself happy programming in SWE, staring at a computer for long hours as a career as I'm very hands-on with tangible products and designs. Then I switched to ECE but it wasn't my fit, and then I tried MechE and I joined this Junior class that kicked my butt, dropped out of those and now I'm currently in ISE.

ISE is a very cool major but my ambition is to design technology products and become a tech entrepreneur. This major is more about optimizing current devices and being a good problem solver, which is cool but I want to be ""the brains behind a product"" or ""a large influence in the specs or features of a tech product that many people use on a day to day basis"" if any of that makes sense.

The ACAD major has completely faded off my mind for a while but I just remembered about it and I'm very interested in applying as an internal transfer by Jan 1st since it seems like a great fit for me.

However, I was wondering what types of cool projects, internships, and career opportunities are lined up for ACAD students as it's something that's extremely relevant to me as a low-income student, with a goal of getting my mom and dad off the ghetto with a decent paying job.

What types of fields do ACAD students pursue? Are many going into product design, or more tech-based positions, or business fields, or if you're pursuing graduate school, what's your rationale there?

Or on the other end of the spectrum, if staying in Engineering would be best for me given I'm a sophomore and would have to stay for an additional semester or year as a result of transferring."

I‚Äôm a sophomore computer science student at Viterbi and I built something that *automatically completes Trojan Check* and saves the Daypass to your phone in a single tap. I call it **Trojan Checked**. I built it during syllabus week but never had the time to share it with a wide audience so here I am.

I built it because filling out Trojan Check is super clunky and a waste of time. ~~The entire system sucks because you can just lie as well so I wanted to break it.~~  

## **[First, here‚Äôs a demo of how it works (click this)](https://i.imgur.com/MjURTGC.mp4)**
You tap the shortcut once, and essentially what happens is it logs you into your USC account remotely, fills out the questions, retrieves the associated information with that unique Daypass, then displays the Daypass to you as HTML. 

## **How do I install it?**
It is a combination of an API I have set up on AWS and the iOS shortcuts app. You don‚Äôt need the Trojan Check app on your phone, or anything else.
If you‚Äôd like to try it, go to **[trojanchecked.com](https://trojanchecked.com/)**, enter your @usc.edu email, and **`USCREDDIT`** for ‚ÄúAccess code.‚Äù Click the check box and a license key should be generated for you, along with setup instructions. If you have any problems, please DM me with a screenshot and I‚Äôd be happy to help.

If you have any suggestions for the app, please let me know! I‚Äôm hoping people find this tool useful because me and a bunch of my friends use it every day.

## **Are you stealing my information?**
**Absolutely not.** This is exactly what data I store and what I do with it:
When you sign up, I store your @usc.edu email **(NOT your password)** in a secure database, along with your license key. I do this because I don‚Äôt want other people to use your license key with a different email (if you change your email and use the same license key, it won‚Äôt work, you can try).  
Also when you sign up, I have a list of emails that used a certain Access code. For instance, if you used `USCREDDIT` to sign up, your email would be in a database in a list stored under the `USCREDDIT` code.  
When you actually use the shortcut, you will notice you need to supply your password to it. This password is used to log you in remotely, and it is **not stored in any database anywhere.** The password passes through and is **immediately discarded** when the function ends (it is stored in temporary space and is **completely unretrievable or readable at any point**, even to me). 

Anyways you can try it if you want. Hope this helps people out. The Daypass is the exact same QR code that the Trojan Check app produces and it properly scans and shows your information at the gym, entering campus, etc (it is not a fake QR code). If you aren‚Äôt compliant with the USC Covid testing, it won‚Äôt work, because you can‚Äôt generate a valid Daypass in the first place. 

## **DISCLAIMER**
Only use this shortcut if you were to manually submit the Trojan Check and select 'no' for all the questions and have no symptoms for COVID-19. This is totally for educational purposes."

For the pdp requirements, they both only require MATH 125 - MATH 226 and Linear Algebra, plus a calc based statistics class, which other than stats I have already completed the other requirements. I'm in Engineering undeclared right now as a 2nd year, and I was thinking why not prepare for my Masters with a undergraduate degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering. The problem is I'm low income and reliant on full need based Financial aid. ISE would demand a bunch of units that would push me over 144, which would hurt me financially. So I've been thinking, would it be feasible to do a smaller major so that I have enough remaining Financial aid for the pdp? I mean, all the pdp asks for is a couple of courses that I satisfied already so the undergrad degree wouldn't really matter right? The only problem is that I was considering majors at dornsife, but they have the 104 dornsife requirement which would just circle me back into the same predicament. It would probably be something small like Comm or something else small outside of dornsife, but I think it would be a bit sus, how I went from Annenberg to Viterbi or something like that from an employers perspective. I'm not too sure honestly, I just don't want to go into large amounts of debt I'm just trying to strategize ü•∫"
