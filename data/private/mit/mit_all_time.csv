I played Varsity football during high school and was recruited by the football program at MIT.  I never really enjoyed football, but I did it for my parents.  Recently, I've been struggling with my mental health.  I've been recovering, but I fear football might be too much to take on in addition to the rigor of MIT.  Long story short, I feel like it would be better for my mental health if I didn't play.  My brother has told me it's not really a huge deal if I tell them straight that I don't want to play, but my parents have told me they wouldn't be okay with it.

I'm feeling really torn about this.  I want to go to MIT really badly, but I fear I might spiral out of control if I do football.  I visited MIT medical during CPW, and got in contact with the mental health department to try and get a therapist lined up for when I arrive.

I have committed to MIT, and I'm really anxious about this.  Would talking to the coach about this jeapordize my opportunity to attend?  I feel like everyone but my brother is really toxic about this; I understand that I told the coaches I wanted to okay, but I'm really beginning to think it would put me in a really bad place.

Do any of you have any ideas as to what I should do?  I don't know if I could make it a whole season...  I could really use some advice...

Could I call admissions anonymously and ask if this would risk my acceptance?  Am I freaking out about nothing?"

Subject: Sharing the decision on Senior House
Date: June 12, 2017 at 3:05:32 PM EDT
To: &lt;@mit.edu&gt;

Dear ...,
 
I write on behalf of MIT's senior leadership to inform you of our decision and our plans to support you.
 
The turnaround we launched last June engaged you and a number of faculty, staff, and alumni in work to promote personal wellbeing and academic success in your community. As you know, we received credible and concerning information this past semester and launched a review. A few weeks ago, we informed you of our findings that serious and unsafe behaviors and activities occurred in the house during the turnaround. Unfortunately, these behaviors and activities have served to fundamentally undermine our shared goals for the safety, health, and academic success of all Senior House residents.
 
The senior officers and I have met with many of you to discuss this matter, and we have received and read many emails on this topic. Before making our decision, we carefully listened to and reflected on what we heard. I hope that, through this dialogue, you gained an appreciation for the position we are in given our responsibility to provide all students with safe and healthy residential communities.
 

**Decision &amp; Support**
 
We believe that significant change is needed and have made our decision based on our concern and care for present and future residents of the house. The details of our decision are:

All residents who wish to live in Senior House during the 2017-18 academic year must complete an application to be a member of the community. You will see that we are seeking individuals who are committed to contributing to a residential environment that supports residents' academic and personal development.

Because the process will be very selective, many of you will want or need to make alternative housing arrangements for next year. Please know that we are committed to identifying supportive and welcoming options for every member of your community who wishes to live on campus. You can learn more about the relocation process and indicate your housing preferences here. (Also note that, even if you complete a Senior House application, you still need to fill out the housing preferences form so that you can secure a holding assignment while your application is reviewed).

We will work to find you room assignments in other residence halls as either individuals or as part of small groups of friends. Dean of Student Life Suzy Nelson has established a relocation team led by Dean David Randall and Associate Director Jen Hapgood-White to provide guidance and support for you throughout this process. If you have questions about another residential community, moving off-campus, dining, financial aid, work study or any other topic associated with moving, they can help starting today. To reach this team, please email residential-support@mit.edu.


**Moving Forward**
 
In addition to students whose applications are approved and the New House students already scheduled to move in while their building undergoes renovations, a cohort of first-year students will reside in the house next year. We are currently developing a program for first-years focused on the personal wellbeing and academic success principles and goals of the turnaround. The program will feature strong faculty and staff engagement as well as opportunities for peer mentorship.
 
While some of you will be disappointed with our decision, I hope you will understand it is firmly rooted in our care for you as students and our concerns about the health and wellness of your residential environment. The senior officers and I are obligated to protect our students' wellbeing and to require accountability when the facts of a serious situation warrant it.
 
We have also worked to respect your privacy and to keep this matter as confidential as we can. We appreciate that you have done the same, and that you have engaged with us throughout the entirety of this process. With a decision now made, we would like to continue to keep what prompted the review and the review's findings private.
 
Please remember that Dean Randall and Associate Director Hapgood-White are ready to help you right now and can be reached at residential-support@mit.edu. Dean Nelson and I are also here for you if you want to talk about the future at any point over the summer.
 
Sincerely,
 
Cynthia Barnhart
Chancellor

Senior House (and East Campus more generally) has a long tradition of being a home for people who are different. And that's who MIT is for. MIT is for more conventional students too and that's fine. But people who are weird and smart go to MIT instead of other fine educational institutions. And Senior House embraces them with all of their complexities and flaws and Haus shares in having complexities and flaws. 

I don't know what exactly lead to the administration's decision. That's not the point of this post. 

The point is that Senior House is not just about the students who are there currently. It's about a longstanding community of people who lived, hung out there, and returned to there. Closing the dorm, to me, means rejecting a critical part of MIT's core values. And rejecting a critical part of the MIT community. 

Gah! This decision is wrong!! 

Is it a done deal? Can we fight this? Is there a fight happening? Some threads here suggest that the current residents have their hands tied.  But there's a heck of a lot of other people who could get involved.  

I wasn't an undergrad at MIT. But as an MIT person, I'm still pissed."

I wrote last month that significant change is needed in Senior House.
President Reif, Provost Schmidt, Vice President Zuber, and I made that
decision together.

The reaction from the Senior House community has reinforced our decision.
The misinformation, denials, and responses – online, in emails, and in
person – violate MIT values. We no longer believe that first-year and
continuing students living in Senior House next year will be able to define
for themselves their own community values and living experience.

This has led us to conclude that our plan to re-set the undergraduate
experience in Senior House is unworkable. Senior House is now closed to
undergraduates, and it will reopen in the fall to graduate students. We
continue to stand by our responsibility for providing all MIT students with
safe residential environments, and we intend to fulfill that obligation.

You recently received your alternate fall housing assignment. If you have
any questions or concerns about dining, financial aid, work study or any
other topic associated with moving, please do not hesitate to contact David
Randall or Jennifer Hapgood-White at residential-support@mit.edu.

To the members of the undergraduate student body,

As you probably know, MIT's other senior leaders and I recently decided that, starting this fall, Senior House will house graduate students only. For students outside the Senior House community, I expect this decision felt sudden. You may also find yourself with practical questions about how it might affect housing assignments for this year.

I'm writing now to explain how we arrived at this decision and what we're doing to help those students directly affected. Near the end of this letter, I also explain the steps we're taking to minimize the impact on the overall housing system, and where you can turn with questions about your own situation.


The Senior House turnaround process
Over the last year, I've spent a great deal of time working with residents of Senior House and thinking about how to address certain longstanding dynamics in the house that produced damaging outcomes.

In person and in print, I have received a wide range of feedback about the situation there. I have read every letter, including many heartfelt tributes to the Senior House community. I know that Senior House has played a wonderful role in the lives of many students and graduates, and I know how deeply many of you care about it.

The positive aspects of this community were clear to me even a year ago. That's why, despite our serious concerns, we took the step last summer of launching the turnaround; we hoped that by working with the residents of Senior House, we could together find a way to stop the troubling behaviors.

Unfortunately, as I recently explained in The Tech, despite significant effort and countless hours on the part of many students, faculty and staff, it became clear this spring that the turnaround had failed. We learned that dangerous behavior – behavior explicitly prohibited by MIT policy and completely counter to the spirit of the turnaround – was taking place in the house. And we learned that the community knew about the behavior, but was neither stopping that behavior on its own, nor turning to us for help in stopping it. 

The problem we struggled with was this: A signature part of the MIT experience is that students have great freedom to shape their own communities. The outcome is usually excellent: students gain a sense of independence, they take responsibility for themselves and their friends, and they develop a deep sense of home at MIT. I know that, at its best, Senior House did this, too. 

But freedom requires a baseline of trust, and commonsense limits around what's safe and what's legal.

The turnaround was an effort based on trust. Once that trust was broken, and once it became clear that residents did not share our commitment to such commonsense limits, it became impossible for us to continue on the turnaround path. 

As we made clear to the residents at the time, a complete reset was necessary and a new community needed to form; Pilot 2021 was our first attempt. In the best MIT tradition of open debate and collaborative problem-solving, some students responded with peaceful protests and suggestions for improving the plan. Unfortunately, to our great regret, the plan was also met with intensive efforts to perpetuate and reimpose Senior House, thus undermining any chance for a new community to succeed.

We reluctantly came to the conclusion that the only path left to us was for the building to house graduate students. We would never have brought such distress to the residents of Senior House if we thought we had a realistic and workable choice. 


Helping those directly affected
This change requires some undergraduates to move at a crucial point in our housing assignment process. We also recognize that it eliminates a critical safe space for members of our LBGTQ+ community. We are responding to these legitimate concerns in several ways.

We are helping each undergraduate who needs to relocate find a welcoming living situation. In partnership with our heads of house and house teams, we are also making sure that our residential support staff have the right training to meet the needs of new members of their communities.

This fall, with student guidance and leadership, we will be taking steps to create a living-learning community that explores issues relating to gender, sexuality, diversity, equity and inclusion.


Housing options for juniors and seniors
The shift to housing graduate students would appear to create a shortage of undergraduate beds, which would naturally raise concerns about crowding. After consulting with undergraduate leaders, we are optimistic that we can avoid crowding by shifting a number of juniors and seniors into graduate residence halls. Rising juniors and seniors will soon receive a letter explaining their options and incentives. This may be a particularly good choice for students contemplating graduate school. Lotteries for students to pursue these options will open soon. 

We are also working with heads of house, house governments and student leaders to make sure that students who choose to move will feel welcome and supported. If you have questions about your specific situation, please contact David Randall or Jennifer Hapgood-White at residential-support@mit.edu.


Going forward
Since I came to MIT as a graduate student, I have been struck, over and over, by the capacity of the MIT community to confront difficult facts and struggle together towards a solution. 

In that work, we will not always agree with each other's judgments. But I hope we can take each other seriously as people of goodwill and members of the same community.

Respectfully,

Cynthia Barnhart

From the UA and DormCon:

Thank you for your patience.

As many of you now know, the Chancellor’s office announced on Friday afternoon that the building formerly known as Senior House will open in the fall as a graduate-only residence. 

As we understand it, the key point of reasoning for the administration was their perception that any undergraduate who would have lived in the building would have faced undue outside pressure from those who wished to preserve Senior House culture. There was a fear that residents of the dorm would be expected to do things such as add former Senior House residents and alumni to guest lists, help facilitate events Senior House formerly held, and otherwise work to preserve a culture that they did not necessarily identify with. We would like to emphasize that the administration’s main concern was that outside pressure on residents, particularly if someone was in disagreement, would be inappropriate and would not result in a positive residential experience. 

In their rationale for this decision, MIT administration cited personal attacks, such as a defamatory Google Ad when googling assistant professor Mike Short for his Op-Ed in The Tech. Additionally, former Senior House residents and alumni were in extensive contact with soon-to-be Senior House freshmen through a private Facebook group. These examples were two among a handful that were cited as the source of the Chancellor and senior administrators’ belief that there would unavoidably be external pressure on undergraduate residents of the building. To clarify, the Chancellor stated that organized and peaceful student protests that put pressure on administrators rather than on other students did not contribute to the perceived external influence, and that those protests were a demonstration of healthy dissent (in fact, the Chancellor sent food to the protesters at the sleep-in). 


Q: What about overcrowding?

Rising juniors and seniors will be given the option and incentives to move to graduate housing. An email with more information will be sent from Housing. This, combined with not placing transfer students from other universities in undergraduate housing, among other special exceptions, will hopefully lower the number of people who need undergraduate dormitory beds to a houseable number. 

Q: When did you find out?

Beginning first thing Friday morning, Chancellor Barnhart began contacting students who had been meeting with her over the past weeks--UA, DormCon, and students from Senior House--to discuss the decision to prevent undergraduates from living in Senior House this coming year. We requested that the decision be delayed, but logistically, freshmen rooming assignments and graduate housing application deadlines could not be extended further. This decision was reached through back-and-forth conversations between senior administration, the Chancellor, Dean Nelson, and Heads of House, and it was unfortunately out of our control by the time it was shared with us. 

Q: Where did we, collectively as an MIT community of students, faculty, and staff, go wrong?

This is a difficult question to answer. We believe that there is currently a gap in understanding between what we mean when we describe and express pride in our communities, and what the MIT administration thinks we mean. We need to acknowledge that there are differences in opinions, and be forthcoming about what those differences are, without ruling out the option that there is space for compromise between them. 

Q: What are your student leaders doing next?

We too are disappointed that none of our efforts came to fruition, but that does not mean that we will stop trying to make the best of a difficult situation. In the short term, we are focusing on alleviating the issues that follow from the fact that Senior House is no longer an undergraduate dormitory. Managing the overcrowding that all dorms will experience as a result of the decision is a priority, as is accommodating the needs of displaced Senior House residents. Additionally, students are discussing with the Chancellor and Dean Nelson several ideas for improving and expanding inclusive and LGBTQ-affirming living spaces from the grassroots level with support from the administration.

In the long term, we must work on repairing the relationship between students and administrators. We will be documenting our efforts over the past year, reflecting on our successes and failures, and using those reflections to fill the toolbox of student leadership in years to come. However, better communication isn’t just a job for student leadership, it’s for all of us--rather than build up walls between students and administrators, we must be ready to hear that some people fundamentally disagree with us, for entirely valid reasons, and still maintain our own strong conviction in our values so we can implement successful ways of working together to improve dorm life and all other areas of MIT together. 

Q: What do we do now?

All students that feel affected or disheartened by this decision should continue to do what they have been doing--speaking openly and honestly about their thoughts and fears. If you are so inclined, we encourage you to diplomatically express your thoughts to administrators and join us in the effort to repair the bonds of trust that have been eroded. However, we think it would be unwise to lash out in anger at those who do not have malicious intent.  We believe that the only constructive path forward is one of collaborative discussion and innovation, not one of infinitely escalating tension.

thinking back on it, i now realize that whenever my parents (or non-MIT people) ask me what classes i'm taking, i intuitively respond with the course numbers; it takes me a few seconds to remember the English title of the courses! i'm sure i also inadvertently use MIT terminology in many other places, and it definitely sometimes confuses my friends and family.

$67k every year for 4 years. That's a $268,000 student loan, plus interest. That's a mortgage! Even if we suppose I'll get aid, there's no way I'm paying less than $200k plus interest.

Not only are my parents not paying for my college education (I have 2 younger siblings and we are in financial straits at the moment), but we are also in the goldilocks range of ""not poor enough for good financial aid, not rich enough to actually afford college.""

This is money that could go to my first house, my wedding, my hobbies, but instead it's about a quarter of a million dollars that I'll have to pay.

My intended major is Computer Science and maybe EE. Truthfully, it was once my dream school until I learned about how stressful and academically challenging it is. Still, I applied, was admitted, and now I’m feeling the nostalgia that’s making me fall in love once again. 

Despite all this, I’m going to college for the academics, and seeing all these students who’ve been admitted, I’m not sure if I compare in the slightest. I’m too humble to want to be the top student because I wasn’t in high school, but I don’t want to be the bottom of the pack at MIT. I will happily attend every study session and go in for office hours and study my freaking ass off to the best of my abilities. But still, I am a slow learner and struggle with applying concepts to problems. 

In terms of my STEM background, I’ve only taken AP Calculus BC and AP Physics C along with computer science course, and even then, I struggle a little with Physics C. I have straight As though, but could possible get a B (85%-89%) in Physic C second semester (looking at you E and M). 

I will most likely not be able to attend EDGE if accepted.  Alternatively, I will take courses at my local community college over the summer if it will benefit me. 

I want your genuine feedback, do you think I will be able to handle MIT?
And especially, do you have advice to *calm my worries* and on *managing the curriculum* before and during my time at MIT? Even a little bit helps :)

9b75wh,https://www.reddit.com/r/mit/comments/9b75wh/scared_to_death_about_starting_phd/,Scared to death about starting PhD,28,13,2018-08-29 00:35:22,"I'm going to start classes soon, and just seeing how academically high-achieving our class is is freaking me out. Class valedictorians from the best colleges in the world, people with 5+ papers out of undergrad, people who achieved more than me academically while simultaneously being well-rounded and sociable and basically the epitome of ""perfect"".

My experience thus far has been being well above average academically, and I'm not sure how I will change when I become ""just"" average. By this I mean I don't know myself well enough to know how I'll react to it. Will I feel like a failure if I don't get as good grades or publish as many ""big"" papers as my classmates? Will I sharpen my work ethic and try harder to catch up? Will I just decide it's not worth trying and give up completely? The sense of not knowing how I will mentally adjust to the change is scary to me.

Even worse is the fact that, up to this point, I have had the habit of conceptualizing my self via the ""meritocratic principle"", i.e. the harder I work, the better my results will be. Thus, whenever I was not doing so well, I took it as personal failure and tried harder. Although it's not a great strategy for personal wellbeing, I also tended to do well academically in general so I didn't often see myself as a colossal failure. The reason for this was that, in my settings in high school and undergrad, I usually came in very well-prepared compared to the rest of my class because of factors external to how hard I worked, e.g. having access to accelerated learning resources growing up, having parents who forced me to pre-study subjects 2+ years in advance, being good at picking up new concepts, etc.

However, in the context of grad school, I will be surrounded by people with *strictly* the same level of experience or better *for the first time in my life* (e.g. many incoming students have taken graduate-level courses in undergrad, while I haven't). What if I get so intimidated or feel so inadequate that I stop trying altogether?"

I was just thinking about how I felt this time freshman year. Using a temp account to post this in hopes that some other MIT student in my shoes can benefit from my experience.

For context: I went to MIT as a first generation kid with a household income of about $30k a year. I don't write this as a sob story. We had a house, cars, food, etc. Things could have been worse: high school friends dealt with single parents, domestic abuse, drug/alcohol problems, but I had none of those. Never thought of myself as poor, just thought that's how the world worked. In fact, at the time $30k was about the 30-40%ile nationally.

Coming to MIT was a culture shock to say the least. It felt like nearly everyone I met went to a stellar private school, traveled internationally, had impeccable wardrobes, the newest iPhones, etc. They talked about ski trips and concerts. I had been to one sit-down restaurants in my life and had never even seen a mountain.

There were some orientation classes on imposter syndrome, but they were of little use when you had to catch up socially as well as academically. I felt incredibly doomed and behind.

I wish someone had told me upfront: There is hardly as much income diversity at MIT as they'd like you to believe. Using the stats MIT releases today, only 26% of families have an income below $90k, which is hardly low-income itself (barring HCOL cities). 42% of the school received no financial aid at all, which probably means they were 1%ers or close. I'd guess an income of $30k is in the bottom 5% of families at MIT. 

Of the fellow students who were ""low income"", many were clustered in minority houses or particular dorms like senior house. These groups tend to be more close-knit by design. 

Point being - if you're not in those groups nearly every single person you meet will have grown up much, much more wealthy, full stop. There is nothing wrong with what you know and have done, you just had different opportunities. Don't worry about fixing yourself, you're fine. Keep working and you'll end up surprising yourself.

I'm not the best writer, so I hope this made sense. Just know that you're in the right place."

Between classes, studying for exams &amp; tests, &amp; going to labs, she claims that she's stressed all the time cuz every waking minute has to be spent working or she fears she'll fall behind. She already thinks her grades are slipping. She barely sleeps, often pulling more all-nighters than I think a human body can tolerate. 

She barely eats cuz she claims that she can't go on grocery runs, she was around 150lbs at the start of this semester and now has dropped 136, and estimates she's gonna drop to 123 before her body stabilizes, if it stabilizes at all, I worry that she's gonna keep losing weight since she's not eating. All her food comes from free food at events and meetings, or by ordering out twice a week &amp; trying to make the food last as long as possible, though she says she doesn't feel hungry anymore.

She also been suffering from chronic depression before the semester started, she said she was going to see the campus therapist but now doesn't have time for it anymore. I don't know if the constant stress is going to make it worse or actually distracts her from it, but I still worry about her mental health.

Last time I visited her she was so drained and zombie like, I didn't see her back to her bubbly self until I convinced her to pop in a movie and relax, and afterwards she was slightly better. She used to be so bubbly, energetic &amp; affectionate all the time, and now she's so drained that she didn't wanna leave her dorm the entire time I was there. 

I wanna help her, but I've never been to a school this demanding and intensive, so I don't know what would help, I have no idea if it's a matter of being more efficient with time or something else completely. I'm not even sure if this is typical for most students working in IT &amp; programming. If this is the typical lifestyle then I guess that would make me less worried, but still there's gotta be a way to make it less bearable.

Any advice at all would be welcome, or even just sharing &amp; venting that this is also your life would also help. I know she's too stubborn &amp; proud to reach out to fellow students for help &amp; advice, so I figure this is the second best thing I could possibly try to help."

I never imagined that I would be adMITted, and I’m currently making a tough decision…. MIT seems incredible, but I’m worried that I wouldn’t be able to keep up and/or fit in (I wouldn’t consider myself that nerdy lol). I still have some lingering questions about MIT after visiting for CPW, so if anyone could provide their input regarding any of the following questions, that would be so helpful!

1. How difficult is it to manage your time? What’s the balance between academics and extracurriculars and social life like? Do you often feel overwhelmed? (Also is it possible to get 7-8 hours of sleep a night?)
2. How challenging/intimidating are the classes? Is it easy to find help if you need it?
3. How accessible are opportunities like UROPs and MISTI and also clubs? I’m guessing you have to apply to most of them… is it very competitive?
4. What is it like to be a non-STEM major at MIT? (I’m interested in majoring in architecture, but I also really like math)
5. What is the arts community like (especially visual arts)? What opportunities are there for visual artists? Has anyone take SAA classes and if so, how are they? (I’m especially interested in painting)

I'm still in a state of shock reading this. From what we're learning about the depravities of Jeffrey Epstein and his coterie of child sex traffickers to the stars, it is appalling to learn that Epstein had deep connections to the MIT community. 

I think this goes beyond an examination of funders, as Dr. Reif alludes. This goes beyond a search for broken processes and ""mistakes of judgment"". We need to know whether the cancer that surrounded Epstein has spread into the MIT community. We need to know what kind of strings were attached to these ""gifts"". Epstein was not a generous man - his largess had a purpose. 

This letter raises many more questions than it answers. I hope Dr. Reif and his staff are up to answering them.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;To the members of the MIT community,  
  
&gt;  
&gt;I expect you know that the late Jeffrey Epstein cultivated relationships with and supplied funding to leading researchers at several institutions, including MIT.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;I write to share some background on the gifts MIT received, to outline our next steps as an institution and to offer an apology.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Here are the core facts, as best as we can determine: Over the course of 20 years, MIT received approximately $800,000 via foundations controlled by Jeffrey Epstein. All of those gifts went either to the MIT Media Lab or to Professor Seth Lloyd. Both Seth and Media Lab Director Joi Ito have made public statements apologizing to Jeffrey Epstein’s victims and others for judgments made over a series of years.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;You may read their statements [here](http://emclick.imodules.com/wf/click?upn=hpP9iphrV3FXP2t3GxIpBAhX-2FHAG0tsEWICDz1533JtH7anuH5Q6I17ZcmTd5yOebyeMC6-2Fzt-2F35ZMp4yUvBWo-2FOEgj3nala2RQJ1R6jgQY-3D_dAuvAbQx20-2Fw2PFip-2BWEmIZ6dWd6cuzGS9uoZxYuehfL-2BqnK-2FcmDmBvZiVu63bFJle2NpndMbtuJyw4OP2RyeKp4fM2U1-2Bes5bWEn1z00BhLWmc31viamSwAOm3-2FIWhr66krq9PJQiQbtc3gbsFo4eYg5WXjWIxjuGKq0oYx1k4zQQ9TPStyDjaTUvTxk3nZ8d3CVIaptKFnNUGyKpsZZahcZRB3tQP72gML4w0gWoBnyleAYn-2FEn2d49-2BRc3-2Fi-2FbTDEC4jUbRqF4X8SgJXioRdcRzU0Wxvo0wYSDoDECAW-2BAoQaveYxN-2FeZw-2BgMbwR0wmszdV9wCi3xOTb7udF8Vji9uy1-2B-2B7IZA4AEAj48tWkYJ6UPrJaTfAkDSKwrQPZQCWDNQhuYmWxE-2B-2Ft1PUJ2PU67XPSe5bZCzHDQWRDCsEewBXH7GOvhOeA4RT28s-2FdkuAX6nLpo72O1MLeDuNJ7EKLD6gUfgzwbjNjc7O8tWY4-3D) and [here](http://emclick.imodules.com/wf/click?upn=hpP9iphrV3FXP2t3GxIpBAhX-2FHAG0tsEWICDz1533JtH7anuH5Q6I17ZcmTd5yOe2hCuU0rB4U1pQJGqCpSYEfcBZKu2eYSbGMHRESs0shc-3D_dAuvAbQx20-2Fw2PFip-2BWEmIZ6dWd6cuzGS9uoZxYuehfL-2BqnK-2FcmDmBvZiVu63bFJle2NpndMbtuJyw4OP2RyeKp4fM2U1-2Bes5bWEn1z00BhLWmc31viamSwAOm3-2FIWhr66krq9PJQiQbtc3gbsFo4eYg5WXjWIxjuGKq0oYx1k4zQQ9TPStyDjaTUvTxk3nZ8d3CVIaptKFnNUGyKpsZZahcZRB3tQP72gML4w0gWoBnyleAYn-2FEn2d49-2BRc3-2Fi-2FbTDEC4jUbRqF4X8SgJXioRdcRzU0Wxvo0wYSDoDECAW-2BAoQaveYxN-2FeZw-2BgMbwR0wmszdV9wCi3xOTb7udF8VsR7c95T-2BrogtMIimRDhgR3CQwkqqCWuqUexCTjXMyVl4b807arByhZLMi94gYJ15PRRa-2BM4QBrZcfiAZy6crn-2BnpIOKQ1sQFFUodJ4c0LAYpGO8OShp9A9ikidMorq9HfvHVFi9onH6M-2B8Jh-2FNf-2FL0-3D). I appreciate their efforts to take individual responsibility for their past decisions.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;However, I believe the situation also requires a broader and deeper institutional response.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;MIT offers faculty great freedom in conducting and building support for their research; that freedom is and always will be a precious value of our community. Yet it is important to understand that faculty are not “on their own”; their decisions about gifts are always subject to longstanding Institute processes and principles. To my great regret, despite following the processes that have served MIT well for many years, in this instance we made a mistake of judgment.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;In response, I have asked Provost Marty Schmidt to convene a group to examine the facts around the Epstein donations and identify any lessons for the future, to review our current processes and to advise me on appropriate ways we might improve them. And to any MIT faculty member who has questions or uncertainties about a funder: Please know that MIT has staff who can help you in gathering the facts and coming to an informed judgment. If you have questions now or in the future, I urge you to begin by reaching out to the [Office of the Recording Secretary](http://emclick.imodules.com/wf/click?upn=hpP9iphrV3FXP2t3GxIpBAhX-2FHAG0tsEWICDz1533JtH7anuH5Q6I17ZcmTd5yOeHZQUnRbWYtGMhfZG8gepb-2BNJuT-2FfpRg4-2B-2Fo1rEUKJ5w-3D_dAuvAbQx20-2Fw2PFip-2BWEmIZ6dWd6cuzGS9uoZxYuehfL-2BqnK-2FcmDmBvZiVu63bFJle2NpndMbtuJyw4OP2RyeKp4fM2U1-2Bes5bWEn1z00BhLWmc31viamSwAOm3-2FIWhr66krq9PJQiQbtc3gbsFo4eYg5WXjWIxjuGKq0oYx1k4zQQ9TPStyDjaTUvTxk3nZ8d3CVIaptKFnNUGyKpsZZahcZRB3tQP72gML4w0gWoBnyleAYn-2FEn2d49-2BRc3-2Fi-2FbTDEC4jUbRqF4X8SgJXioRdcRzU0Wxvo0wYSDoDECAW-2BAoQaveYxN-2FeZw-2BgMbwR0wmszdV9wCi3xOTb7udF8VpkCOt5ZAPF4koUrTMHkByYvlvD9u7TFh9havEnjo6YGfbNR3OjavzaJs9yUOqvhuqk6Lb9sBSq-2BRXoNpmc665ra70YctRI-2F6rBoU2oVVgLk50cxVQCjZMvrtR00IUqNZftPTxJqZwHlqV3dKinfpIc-3D).  
  
&gt;  
&gt;I know some members of our community are now struggling with the fact that they unknowingly or without full understanding accepted funding that came from Epstein, or worked in labs that received such support. Because the accusations against Jeffrey Epstein are so shocking, it can be difficult to maintain a fair understanding about what individuals at MIT could have been expected to know at the time, but I hope we can offer these members of our community the reassurance of our compassionate understanding.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Last and most importantly, to Jeffrey Epstein’s victims, on behalf of the MIT administration, I offer a profound and humble apology. With hindsight, we recognize with shame and distress that we allowed MIT to contribute to the elevation of his reputation, which in turn served to distract from his horrifying acts. No apology can undo that. In response, we will commit an amount equal to the funds MIT received from any Epstein foundation to an appropriate charity that benefits his victims or other victims of sexual abuse.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Sincerely,

Last night, the Executive Committee of the MIT Corporation and I received a preliminary update from Goodwin Procter, the outside law firm retained to ascertain the facts surrounding MIT and Jeffrey Epstein. 

The fact-finding will continue to its conclusion, with regular updates to the Executive Committee and me. However, two basic facts have emerged that we thought were important to share with you now.

First, the Goodwin Procter team has found a copy of a standard acknowledgment letter thanking Jeffrey Epstein for a gift to Seth Lloyd – as far as we know now, the first gift received at MIT after Epstein’s conviction. I apparently signed this letter on August 16, 2012, about six weeks into my presidency. Although I do not recall it, it does bear my signature. 

Second, it is now clear that senior members of the administration were aware of gifts the Media Lab received between 2013 and 2017 from Jeffrey Epstein’s foundations. Goodwin Procter has found that in 2013, when members of my senior team learned that the Media Lab had received the first of the Epstein gifts, they reached out to speak with Joi Ito. He asked for permission to retain this initial gift, and members of my senior team allowed it. They knew in general terms about Epstein’s history – that he had been convicted and had served a sentence and that Joi believed that he had stopped his criminal behavior. They accepted Joi’s assessment of the situation. Of course they did not know what we all know about Epstein now.

Joi sought the gifts for general research purposes, such as supporting lab scientists and buying equipment. Because the members of my team involved believed it was important that Epstein not use gifts to MIT for publicity or to enhance his own reputation, they asked Joi to agree to make clear to Epstein that he could not put his name on them publicly. These guidelines were provided to and apparently followed by the Media Lab. 

Information shared with us last night also indicates that Epstein gifts were discussed at at least one of MIT’s regular senior team meetings, and I was present.

I am aware that we could and should have asked more questions about Jeffrey Epstein and about his interactions with Joi. We did not see through the limited facts we had, and we did not take time to understand the gravity of Epstein’s offenses or the harm to his young victims. I take responsibility for those errors.

While the fact finding will continue, we have already identified flaws in our processes that need to be addressed.

I am confident that, once Goodwin Procter submits its final fact-finding to the Executive Committee and me, and the Provost’s internal review is complete, MIT will have the tools to improve our review and approval processes and turn back to the central work of the Institute.

Sincerely,

He is also the only other named individual from our institution to have taken funds from Epstein after his conviction in 2007. Moreover, and far more insidious, he literally (visited Epstein in jail)[https://medium.com/@sqlloyd/i-am-writing-to-apologize-to-jeffrey-epsteins-victims-eee805c4f13] and came away from that meeting believing that Epstein was sufficiently remorseful! You don't have to be an MIT professor to see that there are some people in the world you should just cut all ties with. Jeffrey Epstein, circa 2007, absolutely falls into that category.

Despite all of this, I walk by his office today and see an office hour sign up sheet taped his door. Seriously? Two weeks later and he's back to teaching like nothing happened. 

I'm not (necessarily) saying he should resign. That would be a death blow to his career and his livelihood, and I don't have the moral chops to say whether or not he deserves that. He also manages a large research group whose members would face varying degrees of career disruption, completely undeserved. And I'm sure there are significant logistical issues in switching professors for a class two weeks before it starts. But there has to be some institutional repercussions here! Laundering the reputation of a convicted pedophile, associating Epstein in any way with this institution, necessitates consequences that go beyond whatever blow to his reputation he's currently experiencing.

冠状病毒（2019-nCoV）是一场生物战，旨在使美中经济脱钩，这是美国在战斗中进攻中国的序幕

The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was designed by the United States and planted in Wuhan, China by the American CIA to serve as a biological weapon meant to decouple the US-China economies; and to separate, segregate, and to isolate China from the rest of the world including closing of borders, severing supply chains and rerouting trade to bypass China with the purpose of weakening China from within and causing internal strife and sowing chaos and discord and also as a prelude to a US initiated fighting war against China in the South China Sea. The ultimate purpose is to protect and restore American hegemony (including protecting the US petrodollar hegemony against the rising Huawei-enabled Chinese blockchain-based digital Yuan and China's Belt and Road infrastructure and trade initiatives in Eurasia) and to collapse the Chinese government, to cut off China from global trade and international commerce and to force a regime change of China's government after defeating China in a devastating physical war.

2019年的新型冠状病毒（2019-nCoV）由美国设计，由美国中央情报局（CIA）种植在中国武汉，作为一种生物武器，旨在使中美经济脱钩;并将中国与世界其他地区分离，隔离和隔离，包括关闭边界，切断供应链和重新安排贸易以绕过中国，目的是削弱中国的内部和造成内部冲突，造成混乱和不和，以及这是美国在南中国海发起针对中国的战争的序幕。最终目的是保护和恢复美国的霸权（包括保护美国的石油美元霸权免受日益增多的基于华为的基于中国的基于区块链的数字元以及中国在欧亚大陆的“一带一路”基础设施和贸易计划），并瓦解中国政府，削减在一场毁灭性的自然战争中击败中国后，迫使中国脱离全球贸易和国际贸易，并迫使中国改变政权。

I believe and have compelling circumstantial reason to believe that the American CIA injected and planted the so-called ""Wuhan virus"" into Wuhan, China in or around the dates of October 31st 2019 to December 31st 2019 with intent to harm China, and the Chinese people, and with potential to destabilize and perhaps even with the motive to collapse China from within.

我相信并且有令人信服的间接理由认为，美国中央情报局于2019年10月31日至2019年12月31日前后在中国武汉注入并植入了所谓的“武汉病毒”，意图伤害中国， 人民，有破坏稳定的潜力，甚至有动摇中国内部力量的动机。

Is war between China and the US inevitable? | Graham Allison

The US wants to re-route global supply chain around China, to bypass China and isolate China on the world stage versus the China wanting to use Huawei-enabled digital-blockchain Yuan, and cashless WeChat, etc to topple the US Petrodollar hegemony and also to use the Chinese the ( One Belt One Road ) BRI / OBOR relationships and bi-lateral trade/infrastructure agreements in order to propel the world to adopt the use of the digital Yuan, and in order to have the world bypass the SWIFT system (since US has abused its dollar status and weaponized it for unlawful sanctions) and to bypass the US dollar as the default global reserve currency etc. It was a race against time to see whom would pull the rug from underneath the other countries feet first. US, unable to compete fairly due to its structural disadvantages and many other shortcomings, decided to go the biological attack route, which allows it to hide under the cover of ""plausible deniability"" (since it is more difficult to conclusively prove the attribution or source of a new mysterious virus than it would be to track the trajectory of an incoming thermonuclear missile etc) to inflict maximum damage to China while minimizing the potential blowback.

美国想在中国重新布局全球供应链，绕开中国并在世界舞台上孤立中国，而中国则想使用支持华为的数字区块链元，无现金微信等推翻美国石油美元霸权，以及利用中国的“一带一路” BRI /一带一路关系和双边贸易/基础设施协议，以推动世界采用数字元，并让世界绕过SWIFT系统（由于美国滥用其美元地位并将其武器用作非法制裁），并绕过美元作为默认的全球储备货币等。这是一场与时俱进的竞赛，看谁先将地毯从其他国家的脚下拉开。美国由于其结构上的劣势和许多其他缺陷而无法公平竞争，因此决定采取生物攻击路线，这使其可以躲藏在“合理的可否认性”的掩盖下（因为要更确切地证明归因或来源很难而不是追踪传入的热核导弹等的轨迹，从而对中国造成最大的损害，同时最大程度地减少潜在的反冲。

Right after the signing of the so-called ""Trade Deal"" in which the US didn't get what it wanted (the US did not get the sort of Plaza Accord concessions that it was hoping to get out of President Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and thought that China would kowtow to the US etc) and immediately into the start of the new decade (marking the turn of the second decade in what the PNAC would called the ""New American Century"" in which it proposed using genetic viral targeting to accomplish political motives) the US resorted to biological attacks in order to contain, isolate and attempt to cripple China/CCP internally and on the world stage at large. After its NED/CIA sponsored Hong Kong destablization/radicialization didn't spill over into the rest of mainland China, and right after its intense year long anti-China anti-Huawei campaigns have peaked in effectiveness, the US releases the evil demon virus into the heart of mainland China, at the absolutely worst possible location (Wuhan being one of the Chinese main Central hubs in terms of transportation and an important city for China's Belt and Road initiatives and estimated to have as high as 8% growth in GDP in 2020) and in also the absolute worst possible timing (right before the Chinese Lunar New year, otherwise known as the greatest annual human migration event, during a time in which shopping, spending and consumerisms activity would have been at a peak etc) in order to cripple China economically, to cut China off from the rest of the world and even force China to isolate its own cities from within, and to have the effect of smearing China's reputation on the world stage and invoking the escalation of fear, racisms and bigotry towards the Chinese people abroad.

就在所谓的“贸易协定”签署之后，美国没有得到想要的东西（美国没有得到希望摆脱习近平主席和中国人的那种《广场协议》让步。共产党（CCP）认为中国会ko头向美国等），并立即进入新的十年的开始（标志着PNAC称其为“新美国世纪”的第二个十年的转变），为了实现政治目的而将基因病毒作为目标），美国诉诸生物攻击，以遏制，隔离并试图在内部乃至整个世界范围内削弱中国/ CCP。在其NED / CIA赞助的香港的灭绝/辐射化并未蔓延到中国大陆的其他地区之后，并且经过长达一年的激烈反华反华运动已经达到效果的最高峰之后，美国才将恶魔病毒释放到位于中国大陆的心脏地带，地理位置绝对最糟糕（武汉是中国交通运输的主要中央枢纽之一，也是中国\`\`一带一路''倡议的重要城市，预计到2020年GDP增​​长高达8％ ）以及绝对最糟糕的时间（正值农历新年之前，也就是人们已知的最大的年度人类迁徙事件，当时购物，消费和消费主义活动将达到顶峰等），以便在经济上削弱中国，使中国与世界其他地区隔绝，甚至迫使中国将自己的城市与内部隔离，并在世界舞台上抹黑中国的声誉。 d对海外华人的恐惧，种族主义和偏执狂升级。

All this comes right on top of the heels of the event last fall, African swine fever (ASF), which had never before seen in China but now mysteriously appeared with the onset of the US trade war, decimated half of China's pigs, which doubled pork prices and contributed to inflation causing pricy US pork exports to double in China. The odds for two such consequent anomalies, timing and location are exceedingly low. Yet both did occur – in almost perfect sequence. Particularly devastating is the very real possibility that this virus was intentionally engineered to have as long an incubation period as possible, and with the ability to hide within plain site, by being asymptomatic during its initial stages hence making it orders of magnitude more difficult to eradicate. Just recently, as recent as Feb 1st 2020, there has been yet a third mysterious outbreak in China, this time of the bird flu kind that is far more deadly to humans and wiping out Chinese chicken and poultry at the most dire of times. Indeed the coronavirus victims so far, both inside and outside of China, are only people with Chinese type of blood, Haplogroup O-M175, designed to attack that type of blood and specifically Chinese people.

所有这些都恰好发生在去年秋天的事件之后，非洲猪瘟（ASF）在中国从未见过，但随着美国贸易战的爆发而神秘地出现了，它使一半的中国猪灭绝了，翻了一番。猪肉价格上涨和通货膨胀加剧，导致价格昂贵的美国猪肉出口在中国增长了一倍。两次这样的异常，时机和位置的可能性极低。然而，两者的确发生了-几乎是完美的顺序。特别具有破坏性的是，这种病毒实际上是经过精心设计的，具有尽可能长的潜伏期，并具有在原始位点隐藏的能力，因为在其初始阶段没有症状，因此使其更难以根除。就在最近，直到2020年2月1日，中国仍发生了第三次神秘暴发，这次禽流感对人类的致命性要大得多，并在最可怕的时期消灭中国的鸡肉和家禽。的确，到目前为止，在中国境内和境外，冠状病毒的受害者都是仅有中国血统的人Haplogroup O-M175，旨在攻击这种血统的人，尤其是中国人。

Dr. Steven Hatfill Biological Weapons Expert says the Wuhan virus it will have to play it out and ""run its course"" not only in Wuhan but the greater mainland China. The host of ""War Room: Pandemic"" Mr. Steve Bannon (Trump's chief campaign advisor and trusted sidekick) predicted this will crush China economically, and that its the end of the XI/BRI/OBOR and will give US the chance to re-route trade of all countries to go-around and bypass China bringing the global supply chain back to US and its allies whilst isolating China economically, politically, etc. They are selling this to the American people and pitching it to the world as this evil Chinese Belt and Road connectivity is what is allowing this virus to spread so fastly to the rest of the world and that it would behoove mankind and all nations to reconsider the security and stability of their own supply chains and basically urging everyone to pull their companies, people, trade, businesses etc out of China. This is not unlike what Wilber Ross US Commerce Secretary already stated a few days ago... that this virus is good for America and will help bring lots of jobs back to the USA... seems like the goal is to use this event to pull the rug underneath China's development feets.

史蒂芬·哈特菲尔（Steven Hatfill）生物武器专家说，武汉病毒不仅要在武汉而且要在更大的中国内地发挥作用，并且要“顺其自然”。 “战争室：大流行”的主持人史蒂夫·班农先生（特朗普的首席竞选顾问兼可信赖的搭档）预测说，这将在经济上压垮中国，而且习近平/一带一路/一带一路的终结将使美国有机会重新引导所有国家进行贸易绕行并绕过中国，从而将全球供应链带回美国及其盟国，同时在经济，政治等方面隔离中国。道路连通性使这种病毒得以如此迅速地传播到世界其他地方，人类和所有国家都应该重新考虑其自身供应链的安全性和稳定性，并从根本上敦促每个人都撤离其公司，人员，贸易，企业等。这与几天前美国商务大臣威尔伯·罗斯（Wilber Ross）所说的没有什么不同……该病毒对美国有益，将有助于将大量工作带回美国……似乎目标是利用这一事件来把地毯拉到中国发展的脚下。

I suppose it could be a coincidence that China, the geopolitical adversary and economic enemy to the United States (according to the US itself), suddenly gets this mysterious virus seemingly far more potent than SARS (which itself apparently only targeted Chinese ethnic DNA and left the white/Caucasian population untouched) at the worst possible timing and in the worst possible location. Wuhan being Chinese's central hub and this being the Chinese Lunar New Year, it has the highest ability to spread and go ""super viral"" whilst impacting the max amount of damage to the stability of the China, both in terms of having the max potential to cause political turmoil in the homeland (ruining people's new year, quarantine and lockdowns of cities of unprecedented proportion, causing many Chinese citizens to get angry etc) and doing the maximum amount of possible damage to the Chinese economy, ruining the New Year in which consumerisms was supposed to be at its very highest points.

我想这可能是一个巧合，中国是美国的地缘政治对手和经济敌人（根据美国本身），突然发现这种神秘病毒似乎比SARS（其自身显然只针对中国人的DNA，而实际上离开了 白人/高加索人口未触及），在最糟糕的时机和最糟糕的位置进行。 武汉是中国的中心枢纽，也是中国的农历新年，它具有最大的传播和传播“超级病毒”的能力，同时对中国稳定的最大损害也具有最大的潜力。 在祖国造成政治动荡（破坏人们的新年，隔离和封锁前所未有的城市，使许多中国公民生气等），对中国经济造成最大可能的破坏，破坏了消费主义的新年 本应处于最高点。

Even the SARS of 2003 had a negative impact on Chinese GDP by as much as 2%, and this new novel virus has already turned out to be far worse than SARS and at a much more accelerated speed of spread and deaths. Unsurprisingly, without need for a single bullet fired or sanction imposed, it already managed to force China to self-impose the closure of its borders and cities, most nations have already stopped flights to China including the United States itself, on the world stage it is another ""ding"" for China's image and gives the propaganda mouthpieces of the West something else to gripe about, whilst at the same time an attempt to cap Chinese One Belt One Road ambitions and sabotage China's growing economy and hegemonic rise. It comes right on the crisp of Trump signing the fake ""Trade Deal"" and the UK decided to go against the US and work with Huawei.... I say something else is going on behind the scenes, more than what we are being told. We could have transition from Trade War, to Tech War to now maybe bio-war, if that is the case, then very likely the US already fired the first, second, and third shots, so to speak.

即使是2003年的SARS，其对中国GDP的负面影响也高达2％，而且这种新的新型病毒已经证明比SARS严重得多，并且传播和死亡的速度大大加快。毫不意外的是，它无需强制执行任何子弹射击或制裁，就已成功迫使中国自行实行其边界和城市的封锁，在世界舞台上，大多数国家已经停止飞往包括中国在内的飞往中国的航班。这是中国形象的另一个“叮叮当当”，它给西方的宣传喉舌带来了其他令人难以忘怀的东西，同时试图限制中国“一带一路”的野心，破坏了中国经济的增长和霸权的崛起。恰好在特朗普签署虚假的“贸易协议”的明朗声明上，英国决定与美国对立并与华为合作。... 。我们可以从贸易战过渡到技术战，再到现在的生物战，如果是这样的话，那么美国可以说已经发射了第一枪，第二枪和第三枪。

China should at least stay very vigilant and have a credible deterrence contingency plan in place... In the nuclear world in which China has DF-41, the ""MAD"" (Mutual Assured Destruction) doctrine is still well in place. But a mystery virus affords far more ""plausible deniability"" for the US. Thus achieving the goal with less fear of attribution and thus retribution. Instead of directly confronting China in the South China Sea militaristically immediately, maybe they think a better way to take China down a notch or two would be the use of ""other means"" to an ends... Science and technology in the world has come a long way since the days of Westerners giving Native Americans blankets laced with smallpox to ""thanksgiving"" them. It is the human condition to be risk/loss adverse. A nation that would stop at nothing to achieve Manifest Destiny on the way up surely wouldn't have any qualms of preserving its hegemony at all costs on the way down. After all, the American way of life is nonnegotiable and Graham T. Allison predicted the likelihood that this confrontation of a rising power with a declining power will inevitably lead to war, and history has shown that to be indeed the case. The US is applying its doctrine of maximum pressure to destroy China on all fronts, with Trade War, Tech and supply chain War, cyberwar, information and psychological operations warfare, and now biological warfare and most likely to be followed up with conventional or even nuclear war once US believes China is sufficiently weakened.

中国至少应该保持高度警惕，并制定可靠的威慑应急计划……在拥有DF-41的核世界中，“ MAD”（互助保证销毁）学说仍然存在。但是神秘病毒为美国提供了更多的“合理的可否认性”。从而在实现目标的同时，减少了对归因和报应的恐惧。他们可能不是认为立即在军事上与南中国海直接对抗，而是使中国跌倒一两个等级的更好方法是利用“其他手段”达到目的……世界科学技术已经来临自从西方人给美洲原住民毯子盖上天花以“感恩”它们以来，已有很长的路要走。风险/损失不利是人类的处境。一个不会为实现清单上的目标而竭尽全力的国家肯定不会在下降的路上不惜一切代价保持霸权。毕竟，美国人的生活方式是不可谈判的，格雷厄姆·T·艾里森（Graham T. Allison）预测，崛起的力量与衰落的力量的这种对抗将不可避免地导致战争的可能性，历史证明事实确实如此。美国正在运用其最大压力的理论来全面摧毁中国，包括贸易战，技术和供应链战，网络战，信息和心理行动战，以及现在的生物战，最有可能是常规战争，甚至是核战争。一旦美国认为中国已被充分削弱，战争就会爆发。

In terms of the bigger picture from the high-level top-down geopolitical standpoint, (all else being equal) America knows that ""time is on China's side"" be it with regards to GDP PPP, or the situation in the South China Sea, or that of Hong Kong, and later Taiwan, and especially as China's sphere of influence continues to grow in Eurasia; or even in the larger context of the digital blockchain Yuan and China's BRI/OBOR to replace or supplant the US petrodollar hegemony and so many other aspects... America knows that if status quo doesn't abruptly change that one day it will be too late to confront China. Trump, as their self-proclaimed ""Chosen One"" has openly stated from the beginning that he won't allow China to surpass America ""on his watch"" and that if his administration doesn't stop China right now that no future generation of administrations will ever be able to do so again. The US recognizes that the situation is quickly reaching an inflection point past which there is no point of return or going back. It is now or never. And since a direct nuclear confrontation is not going to help America achieve its goals or retaining its status, nor reversing its decline, and coming back on top in terms of once again being sole unipolar hyperpower with no contender or meaningful challenger, then only option left after a failed trade war and failed tech war was to attack China in the back by secretly using biological warfare against China, not once, not twice, but now for a third and potentially ever more devastating time as each attack is increased in boldness and exponential in unprovoked escalation.

从高级别的自上而下的地缘政治观点看，美国知道GDP PPP，南中国海或香港局势的“时机在中国一边”，之后是台湾，尤其是随着中国在欧亚大陆的势力范围不断扩大；甚至在数字区块链的更大背景下，人民币和中国的BRI / OBOR取代或取代了美国石油美元霸权等诸多方面……美国知道，如果现状不会突然改变，那么这一天也将如此迟到与中国对抗。特朗普自称“选民”，从一开始就公开表示，他将不允许中国“当心”超越美国，而且如果他的政府现在不停止中国，就没有下一代政府将永远能够再次这样做。美国认识到，局势正在迅速达到拐点，超过此拐点就没有返回或回头的迹象。现在或永远不会。而且由于直接的核对抗不会帮助美国实现其目标或保持其地位，也不会扭转其衰落，并且在再次成为唯一的单极超级大国而又没有竞争者或有意义的挑战者的情况下重回榜首，因此只剩下选择在一场失败的贸易战和一次失败的技术战之后，是通过暗中对中国进行生物战来反击中国，而不是一次，不是两次，但现在是三分之一，甚至是毁灭性的时间，因为每次攻击的勇气和指数都在增加毫无根据地升级。

From the American side the narrative has already been spun that “due to the busy new year China must have accidentally leaked their own virus” and certainly there are motived elements in Western media being compelled to push this particular narrative out in the open at the moment. But it is reasonable to question the motive for spinning something fictional like this, why suddenly now the conspiracy theory from Western powers that China did this tragedy to itself by carelessly releasing a lab made virus that it supposedly had been working on in Wuhan? Who stands to gain the most from this event and the narrative being spun around the event? Also, even playing devil's advocate and assuming the Western assumption may have some element of possibility in that a virus in the Wuhan lab was accidentally released to China own detriment, a reasonable person may also wonder about the timing, in that China’s supposedly first known incident of accidental release of virus causing harm of any magnitude just so happens to be right around signing of historic trade deal and right before the lunar new year mass migration, hence they attack the element of timing by preemptively suggesting that due to the new year rush it must have made operations that much more error prone etc.

从美国方面来说，已经有这样的说法：“由于忙碌的新年，中国肯定不小心泄露了自己的病毒”，并且西方媒体肯定有动机将这些特定的说法公开发布。 。但是有理由质疑这种虚构的事情的动机，为什么现在突然之间西方国家的阴谋论认为中国是通过不小心释放它原本应该在武汉从事的实验室制造的病毒而自己悲剧的呢？谁能从这一事件中获得最大利益，以及围绕该事件进行的叙事？同样，即使扮演恶魔的拥护者并假设西方的假设也可能具有某种可能性，即武汉实验室中的病毒被意外地释放给了中国，这是一个合理的人也可能会怀疑时机，因为这是中国所谓的第一个已知事件偶然释放病毒而造成任何程度的危害的原因恰好是在签署历史性贸易协定前后以及正好在农历新年大规模迁移之前，因此，他们通过抢先暗示由于新年匆忙而暗示了时间因素。一定会使操作更容易出错等。

What's more likely, the Chinese government accidentally released their own virus that was designed to somehow only target their own peoples Chinese DNA and it (the accidental release of the virus) just so happened to coincide with the absolute worst timing for China; (both in terms of the peak of the US China trade war and right before the Lunar new year mass migration) or some hostile superpower took advantage of this for plausible deniability and then deflects suspicion away from them by spinning up this nonsense story? Who stands to win the most from this event and who stands to lose the most? What does common sense tell you? Which nation in the very same first month of 2020 went against international law to trick and ambush a top Iranian general and assassinated him in a drone strike in a cowardly manner whilst pretending to operate under the guise and pretext of 'rule of law' and with the Iranian general being ostensibly invited for ""peace talks""?

更有可能的是，中国政府意外地发布了自己的病毒，该病毒旨在以某种方式只针对本国人民的中国DNA，而它（偶然释放的病毒）恰好与中国绝对最糟糕的时机相吻合。 （无论是在美中贸易战的高峰期，还是在农历新年大规模移民之前），还是一些敌对的超级大国都利用这一优势进行了合理的可否认性，然后通过散布这个无稽之谈来转移对他们的怀疑？ 谁在这次比赛中获胜最多，谁在损失最大？ 常识告诉你什么？ 哪个国家在2020年第一个月的同一天违反了国际法，以欺骗和伏击伊朗的一名高级将领，并以ward弱的方式用无人驾驶飞机暗杀了他，却假装以“法治”的幌子和借口行事。 表面上邀请伊朗将军参加“和平谈判”吗？

The whole idea is to provoke China into responding and in the process having China make the mistake of giving the US the excuse needed to further exponentially escalate. America knows China prefers non-confrontation as the Chinese strategy is simply to build, to trade, to bid time and to focus on its own development and economic growth instead of worrying about confronting US directly. Every nation simply does what’s in their own best interest, maximizing optimization strategies conducive to bettering its advantages. For the US it means taking an early and provocative challenge direct to China in the form of trade war, tariffs, tech bans, coercing allies to switch supply chains, kidnapping Huawei CFO, and surgical bioweapons tailored to Chinese DNA and deployed at the timing and location of max impact. This biological attack differs from conventional warfare in that it would allow the initiator of aggression, in this instance the United States of America, to preserve the option at its choosing to take a more equivocal stance and fluid position by inflicting harm onto China but without a publicly overt display of open hostilities. This virus was engineered to have maximum devastation in high density Asian environments, and it is an asymmetric weapon because these conditions are not reproducible anywhere else in the world other than in mainland China, the factory of the global world with over 1.4 billion citizens living in high density supermegacities with the required critical threshold to cause an uncontrolled chain reaction in infection spread rate.

整个想法是挑衅中国做出回应，并在此过程中让中国犯下了给美国提供进一步成倍增长的借口的错误。美国知道中国更喜欢无对抗，因为中国的战略只是建立，贸易，争取时间并专注于自己的发展和经济增长，而不用担心直接与美国对抗。每个国家都会按照自己的最大利益行事，最大限度地利用有利于其优势的优化策略。对于美国而言，这意味着以贸易战，关税，技术禁令，强迫盟友转换供应链，绑架华为首席财务官以及为中国DNA量身定做并在适当时机部署的外科生物武器的形式，直接对中国提出早期挑衅性挑战。最大影响的位置。这种生物攻击与常规战争不同，它可以使侵略者（在本例中为美利坚合众国）保留选择的选择，即对中国造成伤害而采取更加模棱两可的立场和灵活立场，但不会公开公开展示敌对行动。该病毒被设计为在高密度的亚洲环境中具有最大的破坏力，并且是一种不对称武器，因为这些条件在除中国大陆以外的世界其他任何地方都无法重现，中国大陆是全球拥有超过14亿人口的工厂高密度城市。

It would seem US is counting on the fact that China won’t respond to this attack in order to essentially score a big goal and earn major points for free. This would allow America to crash the economy of China with impunity. Even a total nonresponse is still a reply in the form of China believing it still benefits the most by ignoring this attack (and indeed not even publicly acknowledging it at all) and strictly focusing on growth path after it has recovered. Is this intended to merely knock China down a few steps off the development ladder in lieu of war in the South China Sea — since that could end up costly for US interests as well — or is it really a prelude to war, intended to severely weaken China so that an American initiated war later on would be on US terms and US timing and would be much less costly for America and the rest of the world after China had already been sufficiently decoupled and isolated from the world.

看来美国指望这样的事实，即中国基本上不会为实现这一大目标并免费获得主要积分而对这次袭击做出反应。 这将使美国不受惩罚地破坏中国的经济。 即使是完全不回应，也仍然是中国的回应，认为它仍然是最大的受益，因为它忽略了这一攻击（甚至根本没有公开承认它），并在恢复后严格关注增长道路。 这是否只是为了使中国脱离发展阶梯而不是代替南中国海的战争（因为这也可能最终损害美国利益），还是真的是战争的前奏，意在严重削弱中国？ 中国，以便以后美国发动战争将取决于美国的条件和美国的时机，而在中国已经与世界充分脱钩和孤立之后，对美国和世界其他地区来说，成本将大大降低。

I think Chinese leadership miscalculated and mistakenly believed America would never go down the biological warfare route, just like they miscalculated and never thought the US would arrest Huawei CFO, or that the Trump administration would not put Huawei on the US entity list and then lower the 25% IP rule down to 10% essentially with intent to kill Huawei by choking off its supply chain rather than just playing nice by slowing it down but still giving it room to live. Even Huawei’s recent UK “win” is capped at 35% market share restrictions, Trump had personally begged Boris to outright ban Huawei completely, so the idea that America would adopt any stance of shared prosperity or mutual win-win propositions with the number two power in the world are naïve and misguided at best.

我认为中国领导人错误估计并错误地认为美国永远不会走上生物战路线，就像他们错误估计并且从未想到美国会逮捕华为首席财务官一样，或者特朗普政府不会将华为列入美国实体名单，然后降低 25％的IP规则下调至10％，本质上是为了扼杀华为的供应链而杀死华为，而不是放慢速度，但仍然给它生存的空间。 甚至华为最近在英国的“双赢”都被限制在35％的市场份额限制之内，特朗普亲自恳求鲍里斯彻底禁止华为，因此，美国将采取任何共同繁荣的立场或与第二大国互惠共赢的主张。 世界上的幼稚和误导充其量。

Would it actually serve to prolong / restore American hegemony or would it inadvertently accomplish the opposite? Hard to tell but hindsight is always 20/20 and it would seem by America initiating the recent decoupling with China that it has already tacitly admitted that its opening up with China with the Nixon approachment was a strategic blunder of a mistake. The Soviet Union was going to collapse on its own sooner or later, but America’s warming up to China to further isolate the USSR was indeed an overplay in retrospect. America at the time believed opening up China would force it to be Westernized and made more democratic and ultimately serve American interests by bolstering US hegemony. Instead, China grew up and had other plans for itself. Taking out Mao Zedong’s son in Korea with napalms was probably on the whole detrimental to US interests’ long term, although it seemed like a great win at the time. Likewise, the Five Eyes Intelligence Agencies, led by the American CIA/NSA, ambushing and kidnapping Meng Wanzhou (the CFO of Huawei and also the daughter of the Huawei CEO Mr. Ren Zhengfei) at the Canadian border also did not have the sort of effect that the US had hoped it would achieve. Ren Zhengfei believes strongly in meritocracy and was never going to hand the reigns of his company Huawei to his daughter anyway. Had Mao handed the country to his son its very likely China would have opened up to the world many decades later than what had been achieved by Deng Xiaoping. And today America would still be the sole unipolar hyperpower instead of Pompeo running around the world telling everyone that China is the “central threat of our times”.

它会实际上起到延长/恢复美国霸权的作用，还是会无意间实现相反的目的？很难说，但事后的看法总是20/20，而美国似乎开始与中国脱钩，它已经默认地承认，随着尼克松的到来对华开放是一个错误的战略失误。苏联迟早会自行崩溃，但回想起来，美国对中国的升温使苏联进一步孤立，的确是夸大其词。当时的美国认为，开放中国将迫使中国西化，使其更加民主，并通过加强美国霸权最终为美国利益服务。相反，中国成长了，并有自己的其他计划。尽管当时这似乎是一个巨大的胜利，但以凝固汽油弹杀死毛泽东在韩国的儿子可能总体上不利于美国的长期利益。同样，由美国中央情报局/国家安全局牵头的五眼情报机构在加拿大边境埋伏并绑架了孟万洲（华为的首席财务官，也是华为首席执行官任正非先生的女儿）。美国希望能够达到的效果。任正非坚信精英管理，无论如何也永远不会将华为公司的统治权交给女儿。如果毛泽东把这个国家交给他的儿子，它很有可能比邓小平实现的开放晚了几十年。如今，美国仍将是唯一的单极超级大国，而不是庞培（Pompeo）在世界各地奔波，告诉所有人中国是“我们时代的中心威胁”。

Graham Allison often said that it would take some imaginative creative thinking to overcome the Thucydides Trap between China and the United States. The rising power doesn’t want to kowtow and suffer the fate of Japan’s four lost decade after acquiescing to the Plaza Accord ‘trade deal’, and the declining incumbent ruling power doesn’t want to give up its status and position and even the mere thought of détente is out the window as the American way of life is “nonnegotiable”. So what is left is the realization in Washington that time is on China’s side, and that if a military confrontation is inevitable anyway, then it would be advantageous for the US to strike first while it still retained the edge and initiative. But absent an immediate kinetic force what other options are there to slow China down? Perhaps this is the creative imaginative solution alluded to by Allison, we have seen this virus cause the closing of borders, the pulling out of international companies and the re-routing of global supply chains to bypass China, and physical isolation of China without so much as a single bullet fired or sanction applied, it at once accomplished all the political objectives with none of the traditional political costs associated, no certain attribution, and thus also no blowback nor retribution.

格雷厄姆·艾里森（Graham Allison）经常说，要克服中美之间的修昔底德陷阱，需要一些富有想象力的创造性思维。崛起的大国不想在接受《广场协议》的“贸易协议”后ko丧并遭受日本失去的四个十年的命运，而现任统治权的下降也不想放弃其地位和地位，甚至不愿放弃它。由于美国的生活方式是“不可谈判的”，因此对缓和主义的思索已经超出了人们的视野。因此，剩下的就是华盛顿意识到时间在中国一边了，如果无论如何不可避免地发生军事对抗，那么在美国仍然保留优势和主动性的情况下先发动进攻将是有利的。但是如果没有即时动能，还有什么其他选择可以减缓中国的发展速度呢？也许这是艾莉森（Allison）提出的富有想象力的创造性解决方案，我们已经看到这种病毒导致边界关闭，国际公司的撤离以及全球供应链的重新路由以绕过中国，以及对中国的实际隔离没有太多一旦实施了单发子弹或制裁，它就立即实现了所有政治目标，而没有任何相关的传统政治成本，没有确定的归属，因此也没有倒退或报应。

If it helps -- I'm going in as a pure math major and likely pre-MD/PhD. If I go to Brown, I would likely double major in bio/math. I thrive on challenge and being with people who do, but I'm trying to balance that w/ pre-med requirements. 

I'm quite social/extroverted and enjoy parties now and then, but I don't plan to drink much (and hope to be at a school where that's okay). I'm a pretty driven/focused person, and I like to be around people who are similar in that way (but collaborative more than competitive). I think ""social nerd"" describes me pretty well, though I'm not super nerdy.

MIT -- **Pros:** What drew me here is the fact that everyone is super driven and wants to make a difference, and research is great. I've made a bunch of friends already and feel like I would fit in very well with the community. I love the idea of having pset parties late into the night on whiteboards and talking about random cool math problems, even if they aren't related to class. **Cons:** I'm worried about the workload, sleep, and mental health, especially since I won't be able to place out of any classes there (my school is not very academic and doesn't offer APs). I also don't know how much time I'd have for extracurriculars.

Brown -- **Pros:** I love the open curriculum. There isn't grade deflation so pre-med might be easier. It also seems like it would be less stressful than MIT, and I could test into higher-level courses. The people seem quite humble and very friendly. **Cons:** I'm worried that I might not find ""my people"" in the same way/the community might not be as good of a fit. At my current HS, I've sometimes felt like it was hard to connect with classmates bc they had very different interests than me. I'm pretty clear this wouldn't be an issue at MIT, not convinced about Brown. I also don't know how strong the pure math program is/what research is like. 

Sorry this is so long. If you have any thoughts that would be amazing!! Thanks so much :)"

However, if you say “I will be attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the fall” pronouncing ‘the’ as ‘thee’.

Are there other specific classes at MIT that delve into building much more programming and design experience in other languages?Or is it left entirely to the student to learn new languages and stuff?

Edit: Another thing I wanted to add. MIT doesn't teach principles of functional programming which it religiously taught one time. Now many schools like CMU, Berkeley, Brown teach functional style in lower div classes? Why is that? Is MIT imperative and OOP pro?   
And in this way do students get the opportunity to become good designers (writing good code) or just spaghetti code writers as most Python hackers nowadays are? Which courses specifically instill good coding skills and design?"

I’m a '25 adMIT looking into Course 18 and was curious about the math department culture — just generally what it’s like and the kinds of people who study it — and whether it would be a good fit for me.

Something I was just concerned is that when I’m talking to other adMITs, it seems as if all the Course 18s know each other from math competitions/camps, and I haven’t done those things and I’m not currently part of those communities. And while I’ve studied a lot of university-level math in high school, I feel as if I have a weaker foundation since I feel I haven’t studied mathematics in as much depth as other people — though I guess this is a more minor point because I shouldn’t shy away from math just because it’s intimidating.

I’m also interested in the more applied side of things (rather than something like pure math research) and in particular math’s applications in the natural sciences or CS, so I’m thinking about whether a science major would be a better fit for me (or for CS I might just do 18C).

So I guess my main question is, what is the Course 18 experience like for someone who didn’t do traditional math competitions? In general, what kind of person is/is not a good fit for Course 18?"

The November Games. It was kind of like Yatzee with bong hits. Sometimes there were upside down bong hits. One time someone's hair caught on fire. That may have been me, but it's hazy. Do  undergrads today still carry on the tradition? Also, does anyone remember the rules?


EDIT: Here's what I've gathered from my own recollection and talking to friends and folks online


Setup

* equipment: Frisbee, five dice, a bong, weed

* start the game by collecting nugs from participants. Chipping in is highly encouraged, but not strictly required. Collection is traditionally done by passing around the Frisbee

* if you don't have one already, pick a glyph to represent yourself for the scoring, e.g. a bow tie or concentric circles


Scoring

* ones and fives score 100 and 50 respectively

* three of a kind scores 100x face value, except for 3 ones, which is 1000

* a natural five of a kind is 2000

* a natural straight is 1500

* you can reroll nonscoring dice until you get a roll that has no scoring dice. Add up all the scoring dice

* if all 5 dice score, pick em all up and roll again. Your score accrues from roll to roll

* first to 5000 stops the game (you're out) and everyone else gets one more roll to try to overtake 


Smoking

* each 1000 points is a ""warp"" i.e. a bong rip

* five ones is an upside down bong rip


Other rules

* if you get overtaken after getting out, you get ""come on"". This is permanently recorded. No one wants to get come on

* a come-from-behind (CFB) win, where you over take someone who gets out before you, gets noted as well, but this is a good thing. Contrast with being ""come on"" 


Still unknown: what's a wimp mark? I can't remember how it's triggered or what happens. I remember people shouting ""wimp"" real loud, and I'm pretty sure it was related to the game"

Hello, all! I recently got accepted into MIT and Johns Hopkins, and I am trying to decide which to attend. I am aware that Hopkins BME is the number 1 undergrad BME program in the U.S., but I am not a fan of the location, as it’s a little too close to home for me.

For MIT, the major is a little different than I was hoping for (a bit broader than BME), but I can minor in biomed engineering to get that specificity I wanted. I’m also a huge fan of this location and environment, and since I intend to possible double major in comp sci, MIT would definitely be excellent for that. 

I guess what I’m wondering is, if I go to MIT and major in biological engineering with a minor in biomed engineering, will I be any worse off than if I go to JHU and major in BME? Since the major is presented differently at MIT, I just want to know if I’ll be a disadvantage or not (although I know they are both excellent schools and programs). If anyone in course 20 (or any other course for that matter) has any input, that would be wonderful :)

They just posted the i3 videos aaaand that’s how I fell into a rabbit hole about MIT dorms culture and damn, aren’t the East Side and East Campus cool? Everybody’s always talking about this, but they built a freaking roller coaster, come on. And not because they were asked to for an assignment, not because a teacher proposed it, because they /wanted to/.

And this is really what is so attractive to me about East Campus. How you can just come up with a random idea, or a random question, and you could easily find somebody who’s on board, or who’s willing to show you how to do something. Something is always going on. And how cool is /that/? I’ve spent so much time and struggled so much to find even one person to drag along to try and do something that looked cool to me, but I couldn’t do alone. I unfortunately don’t share hobbies with any of the people I know.

Well, every other place isn’t like this. You can’t just paint murals in other colleges dorms, and you probably can’t do a good portion of the things that are typical to MIT culture in most other schools. Even less so after college, in grad school, or at any workplace.

So, to get to the actual point:
TL;DR: After college, you can’t exactly experience the things that are so typical of MIT culture so easily, so how do you do it? Have any of you managed to keep that joy of randomly coming up with an idea and then making it become reality with the help of your friends, even if you don’t really profit in any way from it? Or if you’re still at MIT, have you ever thought about this? 

Or maybe I’m just reading too hard into things and the reality of actually living at MIT is not at all like this lel. I would just really like to know your thoughts about this, as it’s been stuck in my head for a while, so thank you for your time if any of you reply."

The Registrar's Office says ""You may register and receive credit for a subject previously taken as a listener"" but I'm worried about the academic honesty policy because I took all of the quizzes and exams while listening last semester. Do you think that they would change all of the exam questions every semester or should I check with the professor to see if this is allowed?

Thanks for your advice!"

Also I know most people use wifi calling on campus, but does it work without cellphone service? And my phone doesn't have wifi calling installed, so I guess I'd need third party apps for this.
