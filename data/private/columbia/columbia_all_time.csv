I know it's somewhat frowned upon to look for easy-A classes at Columbia, but I think that students deserve to know as much about the classes they are taking as possible.

I built a website www.ezacu.com that lets students look at A-ranges for courses at CU, and also has a feature to find the easiest classes to satisfy a requirement. This is an improvement over the old gradesatcu.com b/c I organized the data to prevent duplicates and redundancies. If you guys care and/or are interested, please have a look! "

Need some insight.,9,12,2017-03-24 07:26:12,"So as the title says I just got a likely letter. I was super excited for Columbia but the internet just ruined it for me. Everyone is like don't go there, I regret it ... etc. I have many questions so feel free to answer the ones you can!
I'll be going to CC, majoring in Computer Science, and possibly double majoring in Philosophy or Economics. 

1) To what extent are those people right? Do any of you regret coming to Columbia? If yes, why?

2) As some of you, NYC was a big part of my decision. But what's it like for an 18 yo in NYC? How much of the experience am I missing by not being able to go to bars, clubs .. etc. ? Partying is important to me, and I hear that the party scene at Columbia is weak due to barhopping in NYC, but what's it like for the people who are under 21?

3) As I mentioned before, I'm interested in going for a double major/double degree. How hard is it to double at Columbia? Can you do it in four years? What if you do a fifth year?

4) What's it like for a non-athlete at an Ivy? I know the core includes sports and a swimming test and I have no problem with that, but other than that what's the experience like? What percentage of the students are athletes? Do you feel kinda left out?

5) How much of a space do you have to explore? It's really important for me to be able to try different stuff, and take different classes . Will I be able -under the core- to take classes in subjects that are completely unrelated to my major?

6) I rarely took any humanities classes in high school. Do you think this will affect my ability to study the core? Is it based on previous stuff or are all students new to what's in it?

7) What's the thing you like most about Columbia?

8) What's the thing you hate most about Columbia?

9) Is there anything else you can tell me?

THANK you guys very much. I know that's a lot of questions but I really like Columbia and I wanted to get some real insight. Hope to see you all next year!"

John Jay Pros: Privacy, I stay up super late and wouldn't want to bother a roommate, I'm easily distracted and like studying/doing homework by myself, access to food without leaving my dorm

John Jay Cons: Not as social and I want to make friends, small room, have to share bathrooms with entire hall, no air conditioning 

Carman Pros: Air conditioning, someone else with me that will help me meet other kids/will explore NY with me, hopefully a built in friend, social dorm overall, gym, better bathroom ratio (one bathroom between four girls), more spacious room (even with another person), way more social 

Carman Cons: might not like roommate if it's assigned randomly (I can be picky), I'm not used to rooming with someone else and would typically prefer to be alone except I want to make friends and have a positive college experience/don't want to be lonely since I'm from the West Coast and won't know anyone coming in, fairly loud

I’m a moderator of /r/ApplyingToCollege. We’re a community that is dedicated to assisting high school students through the process of applying to colleges. We do this through a combination of the help from high school students, college students, and university admissions officers, as well as a few private consultants and university faculty.
 
I’m currently working on a project to expand our wiki and give the users of the subreddit a better idea of student life and academics at different schools and I would love to hear your take on student life at Columbia.
 
This is the first time our subreddit is working on getting profiles of a school in this manner; we’ve previously had posts on the subreddit, many of these were in pro/con format, but that is not required. Feel free to write in whatever way best suits you.

If you feel as though your views would garner a negative response, feel free to PM me your response. I will still make it public but under my username instead of your own. I don't want students to miss out on information that could be a big factor in their decision.
 
Here are some Pro/Con ones if you’d like to see previous examples: [UCLA](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/6339ds/ucla_pros_and_cons/) and [UC Berkeley](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/63avr2/uc_berkeley_pros_and_cons/)
 
But a response like [this (Dartmouth)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/62z66y/my_dartmouth_experience/) or [this (Duke)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/62qeyy/reasons_why_you_may_dislike_duke_a_memoir_from_an/) is also acceptable.
 
#For some ideas on topics to cover:
 
**Academic:** Quality of education, Academic Rigor, Research opportunities, Special programs (honors programs, Living learning communities, ect.), Grad School Placement, Campus Visiting Speakers, Collaborative VS. Competitive, Major Flexibility, class sizes, lecture VS. discussion, academic quality of peers, grade inflation/deflation, Student body size (help or hurt?), how large does the school feel?, grading, academic stress, study abroad opportunities, average career success of graduates,
 
**University Facilities:** Career Services (Student and Grad), Job Recruitment, General Campus Events, Bias of funding to certain majors, Mental health services, Advising Quality, Access to Financial Aid, 
 
**Student Life:** Typical Student (if existent), Student government, Major Traditions, Racial and Economic Diversity, clubs, organizations, school spirit, athletics (varsity, intramural, club), Social Hierarchy (if any), greek life, city life, party / club scene, other general thoughts on student life,


**Room &amp; Board:** Dorm Life (including specific dorm’s culture), Dorm quality, On campus dining, Off campus dining, Campus internet, 
 
**Weather &amp; Location:** Campus aesthetic, Weather, Nearby Cities (are they accessible?)

Anything else you wish to mention or exclude is perfectly fine.

NSOP is okay during the day, I make friendly acquaintances and learn about campus. But outside of events I have no friends I could call up to go to parties with, or even just hang out with. When I get along with someone I try to follow up/keep it up, but it never works out and I've resolved to stop trying and just wait until I'm in class with people who actually have similar interests. (I have a few friends at a different part of the Uni but not ones I can call up everyday).

Does hating the awkward random grouping of people during NSOP mean that I won't enjoy my time at Columbia University? Or is this a common thing?"

I'm just wondering to see how powerful our Columbia degree is when applying to grad school. *From what I have heard,* grad schools tend to view students from ""higher end"" universities (Ivies, Stanford, MIT, etc.) in a different pool of students when looking to see who to accept to their grad school program. I personally have a GPA that I am not proud of at all, but really want to get into grad school in CA (preferably Stanford, UC Berkeley, USC, etc.) for CS. Does our degree play a part at all in grad school acceptance? Does a great GRE score outweigh this low GPA? Hope you guys could enlighten me! Cheers!

Why can’t columbia invest in quality mathematics professors. Why did I spend 30k this semester teaching myself calculus from kristakingmath YouTube videos. Do math classes in cc typically get curved or will I have to accept the tank to my GPA?

It is with immense sadness that I share with you that Peter Awn, Dean Emeritus of the School of General Studies, passed away yesterday from injuries sustained when he was struck by a car last month.

Since his arrival on the Columbia campus more than four decades ago, no one has been a more beloved member of our community than Peter. The grief we feel at his loss is overwhelming.

This heartbreak is especially palpable for the General Studies community where, during his 20-year tenure as Dean, Peter came to personify the School’s character, its values, and its mission. In every way that mattered, he and the School were one. This unmatched legacy, in addition to his remarkable scholarship and teaching as Professor of Islamic and Comparative Religion, made Peter, without question, one of the essential leaders of Columbia University’s modern era.

The rare gift he was able to bestow upon generations of General Studies students was his unconditional belief that Columbia was better for their presence and his insistence that they believe this as fervently as he did. Peter recognized that General Studies represented the “cutting edge of undergraduate education,” as he put it, and under his stewardship the School has been able to fulfill its promise. For him, that meant a student body comprised heavily of student veterans, first-generation students, and international students, whose age and life experiences would further diversify and enrich our undergraduate classrooms. It meant, also, establishing partnerships with Sciences Po in Paris, the City University of Hong Kong, and Trinity College Dublin. And it meant embracing both the nation’s oldest and largest certificate program for individuals holding an undergraduate degree and seeking admission to medical school and the School’s long-held relationship with the Jewish Theological Seminary.

In the difficult days since Peter was injured he received world-class care from the doctors, nurses, and staff at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center/NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. During this time, I have been able to meet several of his family members and friends who loved and admired him so deeply. They have learned over these past few weeks the very special place he holds in the Columbia community. On behalf of the entire University, I extend our deepest condolences to Peter’s sisters, Claudette Maraziti and Louise Crowley, his many nieces and nephews, and his lifelong friends Norman Laurila and Rob Westerberg.

In the months ahead, we will have opportunities to celebrate Peter’s extraordinary life and reflect on his many contributions to Columbia. For now, I can only convey this stunningly sad news and ask that—in the spirit of Peter himself—we commit to helping each other as we grieve this enormous loss. Please do not hesitate to seek support from Counseling and Psychological Services, the Office of the University Chaplain, and the Office of University Life.

Peter will always remain in Columbia’s heart.

Sincerely,
Lee C. Bollinger"

I understand that I made a deliberate decision to apply and accept—but it just seems like admissions made a mistake.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m ecstatic as all hell and Columbia was my top choice, but I’m afraid I won’t be able to keep up in the Ivy League classroom.

I barely graduated HS with a 2.0, dropped out with a 1.13GPA my first attempt at community college. After a 5-6 year break, I attended another community college and I’ll be graduating this semester with a 3.8. I understand that GS looks fondly at students with a redemption story, but truth be told I didn’t really do much in CC. It didn’t take all that much effort—and I’m not humblebragging—CC just wasn’t that challenging. I feel like the professors at this CC were just happy I showed up to class at all, and gave me a good grade for giving half a shit. I honestly feel like high school was way tougher than this last CC I attended. To put it in perspective, I pounded out essays and projects last minute and still got A’s—and I’m talking pounding out essays like motherfuckin Beethoven on the subway ride TO class. I really didn’t put any effort into CC.

All that being said, I’m glad the breeziness gave me an amazing GPA, but I’m more resentful CC was that easy; in workload and academic rigor. I don’t know how to study properly, manage my time, take good notes, or keep up good homework/study habits. I keep reading nightmare stories about the immense workload at Columbia and my peers warning me about the jump in difficulty level from community college to university—especially an Ivy League.

This is a legit question.

I come from a town full of pretty aimless people, so when I got my college acceptances I was immediately inundated with stupid comments. I eventually narrowed down my decision to Stanford and Columbia, but that's only because my dad wanted me to go to Stanford. The decision was easy for me. If you could take my personality and put it in school-form I don't think there could be a closer match than Columbia. I simply didn't think stanford was a place I could see myself living, let alone enjoy learning at.

Anyway, when I told people I picked Columbia the reaction was either ""oh cool so you're going to South Carolina?"" (I live on the border of Ga and SC in Georgia. Columbia is a pretty big city in South Carolina so I guess I could understand the confusion there), ""Oh where/what is that?"", and the worst one ""bro you're stupid for not picking Stanford"" (coming from a guy who is going to Savannah state but whatever). 

 It seems like people never consider how well you would fit in at a school before they start making judgements. I always have to tell them it is an ivy for it to register with them. But I don't really care about anyone's opinions, I know I'm coming to the perfect school for me. 

The word ""Columbia"" is used so commonly, with clothing companies, tons of cities, roads, counties, and even a homophonous country bearing the same name so I understand the name isn't as ear catching as somewhere like Dartmouth or Yale. 
I would just like to hear about other peoples experiences when telling people where they go/went. How well known and respected is Columbia? 

Sorry if this was an annoying or shallow question, I just need help getting past the myopic views of the people that currently live around me."

I am a recent graduate of a cybersecurity bootcamp organized by Trilogy Education Services at Columbia University. Some of you may be aware of this company which administers a variety of coding, cyber, and data analytic bootcamps often in partnership with universities.

I am writing this thread to warn others who may considering it to save their money and look elsewhere. The cybersecurity bootcamp organized by Trilogy is one of the worst experiences I have ever had in education. Myself and my fellow classmates paid $12,000 to attend this course on the assumption that the curriculum, teachers, and overall course had been designed in coordination with Columbia. This could not be further from the truth.

Over the course of the next six months, we experienced an extremely disjointed and unprofessional program including a complete lack of support from career services, a verbally abusive instructor whom Trilogy, after many complaints, did nothing about, non-functional labs, poor AV equipment that made recordings largely inaudible for anyone who was absent or wanted to attend remotely, and finally, a complete disregard for the well being of the students.

In the six months we were there, we probably sent 6 to 7 weeks in totally actually focusing on useful and practical content. I cannot express to you how frustrating it was to sit through the majority of this course knowing the projects, presentations, and material being presented was in many cases factually wrong or irrelevant to our future careers.

The saddest part about this experience was how it affected the lives of many of the students in the course. Between the horrible curriculum and a verbally abusive teacher, many students quickly became dismayed and received no support from Trilogy throughout the entire process. People spend their hard earned savings or took out loans to participate in this course on the promise of a chance to achieve something that was impossible from the start.

Without going on a rant, there are plenty more details I can share, but my number one recommendation is avoid attending any of Trilogy's bootcamps and to advise anyone considering them to do the same. You can find plenty of other similar reviews out there and trust me, despite a few positive ones, you are not going to be that lucky person who got the perfect teacher and curriculum. With Trilogy, it does not exist."

Everytime I talk to someone they only talk about nerdy or school related stuff, which never really goes anywhere because I'm not big on need talk. On the flip side, while my personality is pretty social I've never used social media because I found it distracting during high school, so I've missed out on events and meeting people that way. So I'm kinda stuck in the middle as a lonely thrill seeker. I've done the whole walking up to strangers and talking but it never works out. Honestly I just want to feel like I've done something social or make one real friend so that I can feel accomplished in that regard. I know it's just NSOP, but seeing everyone walk around in groups or at least buddies up makes me feel like I'm doing something wrong. I came here alone with no one else from HS so I literally have to start from level one.

(This is what I learned from my time at Columbia and just wanted to share it here to help all of you). As students a huge problem that comes up again and again is procrastination. We know we should be studying and getting our work done but it seems like we just can't get ourselves to do it. Instead, we find ourselves watching Netflix, or scrolling through social media. Even when we do our work, our mind wanders and it seems that the material we are studying is so boring that we would rather spend our time doing anything else because this is our professor's version of torture. I'm here to say it doesn't have to be this way. There are ways around procrastination but the first step is setting our expectations high and realizing what it will take to get there. Every semester, we set our sights on getting straight-A's and dominating our classes but every time we start strong and then fall into our same ways. We have to have counter measures for when those rough times hit. When we set our expectations we also have to set the expectation of how much work that will require. If we want straight-A's, we have to put in A level effort in every single one of our classes throughout the entire semester. Once we have that expectation that we need to put in A level effort we have to realize that there will be times, especially if we are just starting out, when we don't want to put in the work and we want to watch Netflix instead. Straight-A students know that these moments will occur and they understand that in those moments, despite how they are feeling they will take action. There is a great quote about this, ""Don't wait for your feelings to change to take action. Take the actions and your feelings will change."" This is exactly what we need to focus on. No matter how we are feeling, no matter our emotions, take that consistent action and once we start seeing the results, once we start dominating our classes and getting straight-A's our feelings will have completely changed and our success will be a habit.

This is the key note I want all of us to take away from this. Our success starts with raising our expectations and understanding the amount of effort it will take. Our success starts with consistent hard work. Once we have the habit of putting in hard work consistently, we will already be seeing results, and from there we can focus on working smarter by developing better study strategies such as time-management and active studying. The main thing that changed my expectations and my mindset around this was through mentorship with people that are where I wanted to be, and in addition to that, getting around students in my classes that were already dominating, we are the average of the 5 people we are around. I hope this helps and shifts some of your mindsets into complete domination of your courses."

Like it seems like people retain strong identities for CC/SEAS/GS/Barnard, and the university bureaucracy also has differential treatment for each group? Like I've even seen publications quoting people like ""John Doe, SEAS '20"" instead of just "" '20"", and it seems like the groups are provided differing services by the university's career services center/housing office/registrar/financial aid/etc. At my school there's literally only one pathway into our undergrad program (apart from transferring), and the humanities, STEM, and older/nontraditional students all apply in one unified process, so even though there are informal cliques and groups, there's no formal way for the university bureaucracy to serve us differently. I'm not trying to argue that one system is better than the rest, but I've asked CU students and nobody really can explain to me why it's structured like so. To an outsider like me the system seems completely bizarre, but to everyone else it seems just normal. Can anyone shed some light?"

She has short hair and glasses. Well I think she is excessively rude. I understand that she deals with hundreds (if not thousands) of people a day, but there's no need to make me feel like an idiot or a child everytime I entire the dining hall. If she was just DMV level rude I would be fine, but this is next level. Here are some examples:

- Very recently I asked about the meal options for restrictive diets and she quickly said ""I'm not telling you, it's none of your business. It doesn't apply to you"". Immediately she assumed my religion and dietary restrictions based on my appearance. The options very well could have applied to me as I have both Jewish and Muslim family members. 

- Another day she handed me back the wrong ID and actually tried to argue with me that it was mine. I don't know what was implied by her assumption of my appearance again, but I don't think I looked anything like the person on the wrong ID she handed me. Needless to say I was offended and embarrassed by the scene she caused.

- Just today she tried to tell me that I was returning my EcoReps box incorrectly, when just days prior SHE is the one who rudely told me to do it that way. 

There are so many more rude things she has said and done to me in that short window of time from swiping in to exiting. 

And I'm not normally a complainer or one to get offended, but this is just irritating. I'm definitely not spoiled either. She just makes me feel stupid and uncomfortable while I'm just trying to eat.

Everyone else in John Jay is so nice. Particular the woman that works behind the grain bowl station and the woman at the action station. They really make up for the swiping lady's bullshit.

TL; DR is there any way to file a complaint against rude workers like her. Really it's just her. And maybe a way to submit compliments for good staff members. Also, has anyone had a similar experience with her or someone else?"

I’ve been feeling a little worse for wear this midterm season for a couple of reasons and I wanted to know your thoughts / advice on my current situation. 


Basically what’s been fucking me up most is that I received a bad grade in one class my freshman fall semester and it absolutely destroyed my cumulative GPA. The class was in a subject (stem) not at all related to my major (humanities-oriented) if that’s important . I’m a sophomore in CC currently and I’m trying really hard in my classes this semester so I can nudge that number a little higher, but it seems hopeless at times because after two semesters I’m sitting at just below a 3.0. Honestly this has been killing my confidence and I haven’t told a single person except my mom about it (love you mom) because I’m just super embarrassed about it. Sometimes, albeit rarely, people will joke with condescension about how they know someone with a 2 point something GPA and I’ll just be chilling there like *yeah haha that’s rough hahaha* but on the inside I definitely shrivel a little. 

I’ve been trying to hype myself up through the reassurance that if I get stellar grades for the rest of college I’ll show an “upward trend” which will indicate growth and ability to learn from mistakes. This is actually pretty much what happened in HS for me (got meh grades freshman year and straight A’s junior year), but from a career / grad school standpoint I can’t help but stress. I know for certain fields like finance they won’t even look at your GPA if it’s below a certain cutoff, but to what extent are there exceptions to this via networking, professional/research experience and the like? And how does this vary among competitive fields? I’m feeling the same semi-desperation when it comes to grad school, specifically law. 

Coupled with this is the fact that I feel like an absolute retard in 1004 Java compared to the others in the class. I generally haven’t experienced imposter syndrome since I’ve been here but it seems like the class is easy for most people while I’m having a hard time understanding what are pretty abstract concepts defined using a ton of terminology I’ve never heard before, especially since I came into the knowing literally nothing about computers except how to use Windows XP and Office 2010 (deadass. on my Mac I can use the internet and that’s about it) It gets hard not to psych yourself out and have spiraling thoughts along the lines of *dang seas and stem kids are way smarter than me and a stem degree probably seems way more impressive than a humanities one so I should switch my major to stem to be more eye-catching to employers even if its at the expense of enjoying school* ... especially since I was pretty good at math and whatnot in HS but I just do not shape up to the level of talent in STEM here.

All in all I definitely just needed to throw a pity party for myself and I don’t think like this always, but these thoughts are still frequent enough to give me a hard time.  

TL;DR: Have just below a 3.0 GPA after two semesters in CC. Feeling dejected and nervous about my future. How important / unimportant is one’s GPA in the grand scheme of things? And do people really find Java easy on the first go?"

At the moment I have a group of people whom I call friends, but my relationship to them feels empty and one-sided. I feel like none of them care about me, or about whether I even exist. If I were to magically disappear none of them would  notice, and even if they did they wouldn't care. Any contact with them has to be initiated by me; I'm not liked enough by any of them to be the one who's messaged first. Sometimes, even when I am the one who speaks first, I'm just ignored and forgotten about. It's the kind of thing where, if I stop contacting any of them, the relationship would probably end because none of them would ever initiate contact. They don't treat each other this way, but it is the way I'm treated. They would never exclude each other from a group event, but my exclusion means nothing to them really. I love them, but they don't seem to love me back.

I haven't felt this way before. In the past I've been lucky to have had friends who valued me, but at this school I've struggled. And right now it feels like I'm at a stage where everyone has already formed their own cliques--like there's no hope of meeting different people who're willing to make room for someone like me.

The typical suggestion is to ""join clubs,"" but it often feels as though people you meet in clubs want the scope of their and your relationship to be limited to interactions within the organization. ""Club friends"" are your ""club friends."" Are there groups on campus where people aren't like this?

I'm sorry if I come off as needy or desperate, but all I want is the feeling of belonging. All I want are friends who value my presence, friends who actually care and who want to be around me. I don't know what to do. All I know is that I feel lost and alone. How do I change this?"

I was admitted to CC as an Econ major through early decision, which means that I would enroll in the fall. My financial predicament has resulted in me having to take out ~$50,000 worth of student loans per year. I was hoping this wouldn’t the the case, but my financial aid appeal was denied. My true ambition lies within the fashion industry, and I plan on pursuing it there. I’ve been proactive and applied for scholarships, but obviously, I am afraid of the immense amount of debt that I will accrue as a result of my attendance. Thus, I have a few questions. 

1a) Will the experience that I will have at Columbia be worth it for someone like me? The environment provided by NYC would likely be conducive to my interests, but will it be worth the potential $200,000 debt I’ll have by the time I graduate?

1b) Are there any fashion-specific extracurriculars that I can take part in on campus?

2) Are there any other financial aid opportunities provided by the institution that I can take advantage of once I am on campus? Even if my appeal for more aid was denied? Can I reapply for more aid as a freshman?

I would really appreciate it if anyone had any thoughts or opinions on the matter. Anything helps!"

This is the message I hoped never to have to convey. I must report the first deaths from COVID-19 within our own extended Columbia community. In recent days, we have lost family members, neighbors, and now at Columbia, we have lost valued employees and one of our own students. Of course, the mortality rate nationally and globally is staggering, but the shock is always greater when the losses occur within your own home and community. I am sure many of you are suffering under the spread of the virus, being personally afflicted or caring for those who are, all the while carrying on with coursework and other responsibilities. Please know we think about you and the burden of these experiences every day.
 
This past week, I, along with Dr. Lee Goldman, visited inpatient units, an ICU, the Emergency Department, and an outpatient tent at our Medical Center. It is always remarkable to see our faculty, students, and staff in the health sciences provide such superb care to the sick under unimaginable circumstances while at the same time seeking to rapidly generate new knowledge that can help others. These are among the most challenging conditions, filled with anxiety and distress, and everyone is rising to the moment. 
 
In the few short weeks since many of you left campus, several of Columbia’s most familiar sites have been commissioned into service, including Baker Field, where the hospital is in the process of expanding its facilities. Emptied Morningside campus residence halls are now being used by CUIMC and hospital employees to ease their commutes. Our Libraries and our Engineering School are both producing face shields. All this, along with the research we continue to conduct and the additional intellectual and physical resources we expect to devote to this pandemic in the future, makes us proud.
 
And, in the final weeks of the semester, it is heartening to know that the academic work of the University continues. We are currently teaching a total of 9,622 courses online—something we previously would not have imagined possible. Continuing with this effort to maintain the functions of the University into the summer, we now expect to offer over 1,800 courses online.
 
There are two additional developments to note here: With respect to Commencement, individual schools will offer virtual Class Days during that previously designated week. And the University Commencement ceremony will be recorded and shared virtually on May 20th. We still hope to have at some later time an in-person celebration, but it is, unfortunately, not possible at this moment to be more specific.
 
Lastly, there has been an outpouring of inquiries about what each person might do to help in this crisis. I am happy to say that there is now a consolidated list on our COVID-19 website of ways you might assist and contribute to others. We expect to add more opportunities as they arise.
 
I want to return to what I said at the outset. I wish I could do more than just express our sense of sadness and loss. I do feel strongly, however, that this is a period when the strengths of universities are manifest and should be recognized. We lodge the professions within our universities, in part because we value and benefit from their expertise but also because we want to nurture a sense of public responsibility as being inherent in these societal roles. The journalist who enters war zones, the lawyer who fights for human rights, and the health worker who braves dangers of infection to aid the ill, all reflect the commitment to the selfless dedication of expertise that universities naturally nurture. As always, however, it is one thing to affirm this commitment, as we regularly do, and another to live it, as we are now seeing so vividly in our Medical Center. It is, therefore, to be celebrated, as an example for us all to follow.
 
Finally, I would say, if ever there was a time that proves, yet again, that the subjects and preoccupations of the humanities are of transcendent importance in a good life, this is surely one of those.
 
From the President’s House, Jean and I send our warmest regards. 
 
Sincerely,

Im a veteran and i just got accepted to GS for Fall 2020 (as a transfer. I will be transferring with 60 units) and I am super happy about this as i would be the first one from my family going to an Ivy League university. One thing I am not super happy about is the obvious money issue. 

From a simple google search, the estimated annual tuition for 2020-2021 will be $71,460.00. I have the GI Bill which I have partially used for one semester of community college (I am not sure if this will be an issue of how much the GI bill would help me out if I used my benefits at a different school). I just looked on the VA website and the GI bill will pay for $24,477.00 annually, which is great but it definitely wont cover all. The yellow ribbon program will pay $24,476.79 annually (i think... im not quite sure how this program works), which will also help significantly. Assuming that those numbers are accurate, I would have to pay $22,506.21 out of pocket annually.

I ended up at that number because I am not a resident of New York but a resident of California and I am really not sure if I would qualify for financial aid as someone mentioned in a different subreddit. Can someone explain/help/let me know how I could potentially graduate from columbia debt free? Maybe there's another benefit for veterans that I am not privy to? Please help!

As one of the most perplexing and difficult semesters in memory draws to an end, I write now with some updates on the shape of the summer and the academic year to come. 

Let me just begin by expressing, once again, our genuine gratitude for the extraordinary ways in which every member of the University community has responded to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, first and foremost, of course, our colleagues at the Medical Center. This has been a spring for the ages, and my deepest hope is that the goodwill and collective effort manifested in this crisis will continue to sustain us in the months and years ahead. At this very moment, I am especially thinking of our graduating classes and of how our campus would ordinarily be filled with the anticipation of one of the most uplifting and magnificent academic ceremonies on the planet. Though we will all gather virtually for these milestone events, having to forego what we wish most for will only magnify the feelings of warm connection we will have in the years to come with the Class of 2020. As I plan to say on Commencement day, these strange and frightening times have most certainly deepened our collective appreciation of the University’s many vital roles in society, beginning with the search for fundamental knowledge and carried through to the care of humanity and the world. 

As disjointed as this moment has come to feel, as filled as it is with deep uncertainties, we must move forward. I write first, then, about the state of our research. 

Over the last several weeks, we have developed an intricate plan for returning to laboratory research that has necessarily been suspended. Following the guidance of our public health experts, and pending the approvals from the State to ease stay-at-home orders in New York City, we will gradually allow our faculty and certain graduate students to return to their lab research sites, ensuring, most of all, of course, the safety of our community. It is our hope that this plan can be activated as early as June. Ira Katznelson has communicated the details of our schedule and the conditions to our researchers.

We also have been intensely focused on the general form of our next academic year. We all wish to return to in-person instruction and campus life, and our intent is to make that possible as soon as it is safe to do so. The hard fact is, however, that we just cannot predict now when that moment will arrive. Yet, we can put in place structures that maximize prospects for that outcome and offer meaningful steps along the way. Our primary goal must be to create as rich an academic experience as possible, in whatever form that will take, while preparing to bring us back together at the earliest feasible moment. No doubt social distancing techniques will be with us for some time, which, of course, complicates the logistics of the return. Taking these and other factors into account, we have made one key decision: to prepare to use the three upcoming academic terms—fall 2020, spring 2021, and summer 2021—as a unit of time in order to provide us with the greatest amount of flexibility in organizing our educational experiences. 

By leveraging a longer period of time, we will be able to de-densify our campus so that all students may experience much, if not most, of their coursework in person over the arc of the three terms. While this is just the beginning of a University-wide effort to determine the specifics of the academic year, we now have the capacity to tap into the rich expertise and creativity of our University leaders and faculty to shape the substance and content of this one-time arrangement. By July 1, Ira Katznelson, our spectacular deans, and I will have more details to share about how the three terms will be composed. 

May is always filled with the sense of exhilaration of admitting new classes across our schools and colleges. It is natural to wonder—and we have—how the understandable anxieties among our prospective students about how the current crisis will affect their beginnings at Columbia will in turn affect their college plans. Amid such uncertainty, it gives me great pleasure and pride to share that all we now know suggests we will welcome one of the most talented and formidable cohorts of new students this fall. As with their predecessors, these exceptional individuals will add immeasurably to the intellectual life at Columbia, perhaps even more than usual because they have already displayed a kind of courage and fortitude to maintain a steady course in the search for knowledge.

One can only feel a sense of humility in the face of the broad human response as we grapple with a threat as menacing as COVID-19. And one can only feel thankful for our universities and for Columbia, in particular. New York City is almost always the epicenter of crises that strike this nation, and Columbia University in the City of New York is, therefore, too. This is not exactly to be wished for, but it does create, over time, an intellectual character that is grounded in the hard realities of existence. And, on balance, inhabiting a space imbued with that character is where I would rather be. I trust that view is shared by everyone at Columbia. 

From the President’s House, Jean and I send you our very best. 

Sincerely,

Lee C. Bollinger"

These past couple days, I've felt more disillusioned about Columbia than I ever have before. Graduation, I worry, had the opposite effect than what was intended: I feel dispirited, under-recognized, and excluded.

Much of the problem surely has to do with this year's Commencement being online. I haven't seen most of my friends since mid-March -- I didn't get to hug them goodbye, share in their excitement for the future, or reminisce about the four years past. Instead I spent the moment I had thought about for years watching the TV with my mom and brother, trying to make the most of a very ordinary rainy day.

But all of that is, of course, only part of the story. COVID has taken something from everyone, and a couple days on the South Lawn listening to bittersweet speeches is a comparatively small thing to be deprived of. I am privileged to have spent the day with a healthy, loving family, in a home and livelihood left intact by the crisis. I am privileged even to have graduated, really.

There's something a little more insidious, though, that I felt creeping into the past couple day's festivities (if you can call them that). I'm not even sure this has anything to do with the pandemic, so it's really the thing I'm seeking advice about.

I majored in philosophy with the assurance that it's what I love to learn about, and has been since the beginning of High School. I've known for a long time that I wanted to head to graduate school after Columbia to get my PhD and then, hopefully, teach. When I got to Columbia, I found that there was a small cohort of students majoring in philosophy with the same goals, and that there was a general air of competition among these people. So I avoided them -- I never extended my familiarity with them beyond acquaintance, and I tried at every turn to avoid measuring my achievements against theirs. All of this was with the hope that I could do my only thing for four years and still do enough to compete with these folks for placement in a good graduate program (for which I will apply this year).

I worked my ass off for years, I pored my soul into a thesis that I suspect only my advisor read. But graduation -- especially that reading of the names of students being recognized for one or another special reason -- has made me feel like it wasn't enough. I didn't secure any sort of honors (college or departmental), I feel like I made no lasting impression on my professors or peers, and I feel no real sense of pride at all. My GPA was 3.68, which is not bad by any stretch. And yet I just feel steeped in mediocrity.

I'm not sure I'm even cut out for graduate school. I love Philosophy -- it's an enormous part of my life and sense of self. But the students in my department who have been recognized to such an extent by the university -- they love philosophy too, maybe even more than me. Maybe they worked harder, maybe they built lasting relationships with the professors. I don't know. But if *these* are the people I'd have to compete with in applying to graduate schools or securing a job in academia, I'm not sure I'd make the cut. Especially not with the incoming economic disaster.

So I guess I wanted to confess all of this, and maybe solicit some consolation from people who are feeling (or have felt) the same. The old adage has helped to get me through the past couple days, to some extent: *compare and despair*. I know that life sometimes deals you a hand of cards you don't like -- I'm just a little lost. Thanks for reading my whining if you made it this far. Stay safe and healthy."

So I started the application in December. At that point I had a job.
It was a very, very difficult job in a fine dining restaurant, but it paid me well enough, and gave me 30 hrs in 3 days.
Now I've been looking for something new. It seems like every restaurant job is now mandating a full-time schedule, 5 days a week.
This is not to mention that I will have to learn a new menu while also learning in Columbia. Before I went to college recently I spent 6 months learning the menu before I went to college. It can be very stressful and it seems that chefs will have endless excuses to fire someone with there being so many unemployed.
Additionally, most are only offering minimum wage.
I applied for multiple casual jobs on campus.
Unfortunately they told me none were available.
I'm looking for a job in other fields, entry level of course, and again, it's very hard to find something part time.
From everyone I have talked to, it's not realistic to work full time while even going part time at GS.
Ideally I would find a job that gives me two days consistently at 18-20 an HR.
Then I would live in a place in Harlem for cheap.
I have looked at a few off campus locations so far and they have mostly been disgusting but affordable in the 600-800 range.
I could afford that but barely.
I was hoping the school would be able to provide some assistance in finding a job, but due to the pandemic it's very hard to get in touch with anyone.
I have to say I'm just deeply disappointed.
Going to this school is a dream.
I hoped that there would be some viable way to do this. I'm considering trying to work full time while taking two classes. To give it a shot at all.
I really wish they offered more assistance. The only thing I can do now is defer and hope by some miracle I find a job willing to meet my requirements."

Still a lot of questions obviously, but it's better than what we knew before?

Dear Members of the Barnard Community,

I hope that you and your loved ones are well as the nation continues to weather the pandemic and struggles in its reckoning with the anti-Black violence made so visible by the brutal events of these past months. Please know that we are thinking about each of you and our future together. We continue to believe that Barnard must make a distinctive contribution to these historic challenges through teaching, learning, scholarship, and collective action, and in that spirit I write to you today to update you on new aspects of our curriculum and on our current plans for a safe return to campus in the fall. 

Faculty, staff, students, and administrators have been working in various capacities to help plan for the upcoming academic year.  As President Beilock mentioned in her [May 14 email](https://alert.barnard.edu/news/looking-forward-2020-21-academic-year), we will share a detailed plan for the Fall semester by early July. While many important decisions have yet to be made, there is significant clarity on several parts of the year ahead that I am happy to share with you now. 

Most importantly, Barnard will be open for some form of both academic instruction and student life this fall. We will offer as many opportunities for in-person experiences, residential living, and co-curricular activities as possible, subject to rigorous public health and safety constraints, including from New York State, New York City, local health departments, and the CDC. 

**The Academic Year Calendar**

Our [calendar for the Academic Year](https://barnard.edu/academic-calendar) is now set. As always, it is aligned with the calendar of Columbia University to ensure that all our students can take full advantage of the myriad options available to undergraduates at both institutions. 

Students will have the flexibility to plan their academic year courses over a significantly more expansive period of time that includes both the traditional Fall and Spring semesters and a new Summer term. There will be no extra tuition fees for summer courses.

The Fall semester will begin as planned on September 8 and will end on December 23. We will be flexible and supportive in offering classes in multiple formats. All classes will be offered remotely or in a high-flex modality that allows for both in-class and online delivery of instruction. We are making significant investments in classroom technology and in pedagogic training that will enhance the quality of all of our courses as they are delivered in this new format. 

The Spring semester will begin one week earlier than planned, on January 11, and Commencement will be held after the conclusion of the Spring semester in the last week of April. Specific dates for both the Barnard and University Commencements will be forthcoming, as well as a date for the in-person Commencement for the Barnard Class of 2020 that we were unable to hold this past spring.

The Summer term will be split into two unique six-week periods, which should allow students who want to take classes and pursue internship or summer employment opportunities the ability to do so. Each of the Fall and Spring semesters will also be divided into two equal parts — Part A and Part B — to enable students to take a host of immersive seven-week classes in addition to their semester-long courses. The goal of these immersive classes is to allow our students to take a reduced load of classes that offer a depth of engagement and learning over a shorter and more intensive period of time.

Detailed information on class registration for this new schedule will be available in early July.

**New and Innovative Curriculum**

Our exceptional faculty have been working to redesign aspects of our curriculum that  adjust to the three-term calendar and to the new immersive course format. As always, but in a more focused way than ever, they have also been developing new courses that will address the “big problems” we face in 2020. These courses will be focused on major challenges confronting society and the planet now and with an eye to the future.

As part of our focus on big problems, we will be offering a campus-wide lecture series that brings leading scholars and practitioners to campus virtually as we tackle as a community the key issues facing us today. Concurrent with this lecture series, we will introduce a new and exciting component to our First-Year Writing and First-Year Seminar classes that will bring students together in their sections to discuss the lecture and engage the content. Students will create a final group project that will be in dialogue with the lecture series and will be archived for historical purposes. Additional new classes will be created across the academic divisions that link to the College-wide lectures and address the significant issues of this challenging time.

We are excited about the new curricular options that will be available to students and energized by our faculty’s rigorous focus on best practices for online learning. 

While we wait for the fall, we know that many in our community are eager to address the injustices and inequalities that are currently playing out in the protests taking place in our country and the world. To that end, and as Vice President Ariana González Stokas wrote in her [most recent message to campus](https://barnard.edu/news/work-racial-justice), the College will offer an ongoing time “to reflect, respond, understand, enact, and reimagine racial justice at Barnard and how to work on anti-racism in our own lives and communities.” These virtual gatherings, which will begin on Monday, June 22, and will occur each Monday over the summer from 9 to 10 a.m., are available to all students, faculty, and staff, and will provide space for dialogue, support, and the study of racial justice. Please email [diversitycouncil@barnard.edu](mailto:diversitycouncil@barnard.edu) for the Zoom link and further details. 

**A Ramp-Up of Laboratory Research This Summer**

While the campus has been mostly quiet since mid-March, we are pleased to announce that we are phasing-in a gradual reopening of laboratory research for faculty, beginning on Monday, June 22. Our return to research lab use will require strict adherence to New York State guidance and our own detailed safety protocols. Our faculty researchers are excited to resume their research this summer with the goal of incorporating some student research into our science labs in the fall.

**Next Steps**

I know that you still have many questions about living and learning at Barnard for the forthcoming academic year. Please know we are working to provide you with this information as soon as possible. As we pursue the goal of being together on campus this fall, we are acutely aware of the unpredictability of the pandemic. In the coming weeks, our various committees focused on [fall planning](https://alert.barnard.edu/2020-21-planning) will continue to refine their plans in consultation with local City and State governments, as well as medical and epidemiological experts. Our goal is to be as flexible as possible in how we implement the 2020-2021 academic year as we focus on our shared pursuit of teaching, scholarship, and research.

Finally, we are deeply grateful to the many who have worked with us on every aspect of our return to campus. Their significant contributions to our collective efforts will continue to lead to strong decisions and, beyond that, help shape and define the Barnard community’s responses to the exigencies of this time. Our highest goal of this moment is to learn in and from these circumstances so that, together, we may be agile, resilient, responsive, and creative as we serve our society.

I'm not concerned with trying to make a switch to management consulting or finance (aiming for promotion to director and VP in my firm eventually) but 80k is  massive opportunity cost and I'm wondering if the same ROI and career prospects could be had from a MBA program at a local university where I live for half the price.

“Look to your left, look to your right. One of you won’t be here in the next semester.”

It’s a typical lecture delivered at the start of a semester in the sciences, and one that [Ainissa Ramirez](https://www.ainissaramirez.com/) remembered hearing early during her undergraduate studies at Brown University.

Now a successful materials scientist and science writer, Dr. Ramirez recalls that she was almost pushed out of pursuing a career in science because of her weed-out classes. As their name suggests, the classes are common especially in the sciences and mathematics at American universities, and are designed to demarcate students who are likely to do well in a given subject from those who are not.

Those who excel in these introductory classes can proceed with completing a major on the topic if they wish. But [there’s evidence](https://ece.northeastern.edu/edsnu/mcgruer/USC/Weed-Out-Courses-Diversity-Science111209.pdf) that weed-out classes disproportionately hinder underrepresented groups including women as well as Black, Native American and Hispanic people from pursuing STEM degrees.

“Everyone should have some science in their life,” Dr. Ramirez said, adding that classes should be tailored toward different students’ needs rather than constantly trying to eliminate them.

“Your life’s path is decided for you based on this weed-out class,” she said. “That’s the problem that I have.”

[A study](https://advances.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aba9221) published this month in the journal Science Advances adds to evidence that whether or not students can endure weed-out classes has less to do with innate ability and more to do with their frame of mind and social connections with their classmates when starting a rigorous new course of study.

In an experiment involving 226 biology undergraduate students taking an introductory biology class at Columbia University in New York, the researchers found that a simple psychological exercise improved the chances of all students taking a second semester class, regardless of race or gender. The study highlights how a variety of interventions might help more students stay in the pipeline to become future scientists, engineers and mathematicians.

The study authors asked about half the students to complete a short exercise in the third week of the semester before their first test in which they ranked family, friends, independence, religion, creativity and other aspects of their lives in order of importance. They then wrote an essay on the most important things in their lives for 15 minutes. This is called a values affirmation exercise, and the idea behind it was to make students less defensive and more comfortable when it came to interacting and engaging with their classmates. Several [previous studies](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-psych-010213-115137) have shown that conducting such a task can help produce positive social attitudes, outcomes and behavior.

The remaining students, who served as a control group, also listed values in order of importance to them, and wrote an essay about the things they considered least important, explaining what might be of importance to someone else.

What the authors found was that the group of students who completed the affirmation task made on average 29 percent more friends in the course by its end than those who didn’t complete the task. They were also nearly 12 percent more likely to take the next biology class in the following semester.

“This exercise is really a way to broaden people’s focus in a stressful moment when they might otherwise be very narrowly focused on the test,” said Kate Turetsky, a co-author of the study who is a social psychologist at Princeton University.

Dr. Turetsky acknowledged that the ways affirmation techniques are used in needed further study, and that they may not be sufficient to retain more students in STEM education. But the outcomes for students in her experiment hinted at one truth of weed-out classes and how science education can be structured.

“There’s a growing body of evidence that people’s social relationships are really important for these outcomes,” she said. This means teachers and lecturers should redesign their courses to help people maintain relationships and strengthen social networks, perhaps through more collaboration, cooperation, group work and less competition, she said.

Andrew Koch, president of the John N. Gardner Institute for Excellence in Undergraduate Education, says the new study’s methods are sound. He notes, however, the study is “trying to address the symptom of the illness, not the illness itself.”

The institute has created a [“Gateway to Completion” program](https://www.jngi.org/gateways-to-completion#:~:text=Gateways%20to%20Completion%2C%20an%20evidence,first%2Dgeneration%20and%20historically%20underrepresented), which [aims to help institutions](https://cen.acs.org/education/undergraduate-education/Weeding-inequity-undergraduate-chemistry-classes/98/i34) with high enrollment courses and high failure rates. He said the course exists because race, ethnicity and family income remain the best predictors of success in college.

Ultimately, Dr. Koch [advocates abolishing weed-out classes](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-25304-2_7).

“I do think we need to have high expectations and high standards for our students,” he said. “But to conflate that with a third to a half of the students failing out of introductory courses really grossly manipulates what rigor means.”

Dr. Ramirez agrees. For her, “the problem is not the student, it’s the class.” She added that she passed that key class because her chemistry professor had a tutorial version of her class, allowing her to study at her own pace and focus her energy on the other subjects. “I also got a lot of tutors and spent a lot of time in the library and had study groups.”

Dr. Ramirez suggests that aligning students with their motivations and connecting them with like-minded people is important, but the concept of a weed-out class is fundamentally flawed.

That’s because weed-out classes were originally created in the 19th century in response to the fact that only limited slots were available on STEM courses. “That doesn’t necessarily apply now,” Dr. Ramirez said. “There’s a disconnect between the culture that established the weed-out course and what’s going on today.”"

This spring, we will adjust our policies to allow all CC and SEAS seniors to live in a single room on campus. We may also have some space for a few juniors. For GS undergrads, seniors will get priority approval for housing in Columbia Residential; all GS students remain eligible to apply for University apartment housing.

Students with conditions that are not conducive to learning (for example, no access to stable internet or a quiet study space) or students who require campus resources (for example, special archives) will also be able to apply to live on campus.

Many of our undergrad courses will be virtual or hybrid. We're trying to figure out hybrid options to accomodate students living on or near campus--we'll announce final plans about this in December.

For grad students, your spring plans will be announced soon: in many cases, that means expaned in-person and hybrid options.

We're going to expand our COVID-19 testing program to help deal with all of this.

If you're traveling for Thanksgiving or Winter Break, please stay safe. Love y'all.

 Dear Columbia College students,  


&gt;I hope that you’re well. I know that this time can be somewhat stressful, even under the best of circumstances, as days get shorter and midterm assignments are due — and of course the conditions created by COVID-19 continue to complicate our lives.

If you have questions about these changes, or if you want to talk about whether the changes affect choices you want to make for the current term, please schedule an appointment to [talk with your adviser](https://click.outreach.college.columbia.edu/?qs=d6cbd5618f4376952654847a0a20398b3c0f8a910424f010cddc64f0e2c72364a51a659f1a8fab23d6d81f1f9c6f141f49230c52bd1bfdf0) in the Berick Center.

&gt;  
*Modifications of Academic Policies for the Fall 2020 semester*  
After an abrupt and brief introduction to online courses in Spring 2020, students now taking a fully online semester are in a system of learning that is still less than familiar to them — one that continues to require them to develop and practice new types of engagement in class, new strategies for learning with online materials, and new habits for work in remote locations. It is also a system of learning that can suffer interference from a variety of technical difficulties or limitations. In recognition of these current challenges, the CC-GS Committee on Instruction (COI) has approved some temporary modifications to certain academic policies for the Fall 2020 semester:  
&gt;  
&gt;Students will be able to elect the pass/d/fail option for one class this semester without restriction — i.e., the course chosen for this grading option can fulfill a requirement for the Core Curriculum; a requirement for a major, concentration, or special concentration; or an elective.  
&gt;  
&gt;The deadline for declaring the pass/d/fail option for a course will be extended to the last day of classes for the term (December 14).  
&gt;  
&gt;Students who completed an immersive course in the “Fall A” term can choose to retroactively apply the pass/d/fail option to that course as their one pass/d/fail course for Fall 2020.  
&gt;  
&gt;The deadline to withdraw from a course will also be extended to the last day of classes for the term (December 14).  
&gt;  
&gt;The usual policy for lifting a “P” to uncover a grade will continue. Students will be able to see their assigned grade for the course in question in SSOL and decide by the end of the second week of the Spring 2021 semester (by January 22) whether to uncover the grade or let the “P” remain on the transcript permanently.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;It is important to note that there are situations in which it may not be desirable or beneficial for students to use the pass/d/fail option for particular courses of study. The notation of a “P” on a transcript can be read differently by different audiences (within a department or program, within a school, by admissions programs of graduate and professional programs, by employers), and it is important for students to consider future plans when considering a decision that will affect their educational records. **Students are therefore strongly encouraged to speak with their academic advisers and their Directors of Undergraduate Studies before making the decision to use the pass/d/fail option, particularly for a class within a major or concentration or for a class that is required or may be important for graduate study.**"

Chad, CC ’24, who hopes to work at Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, or maybe Google one day, said that his unique aspirations make this news mostly irrelevant. “A what?” he asked, before opening gmail to update his spam filters. Chad currently has a B in Data Structures and could not be reached for further comment.

Speaking with reporters at a press conference on the condition of anonymity, Elkins noted that their work is far from over — “I’m looking at you, dissertation,” she exclaimed around halfway through, to audible moans. When asked about fringe topics, such as how students are supposed to graduate if they can’t even get off waitlists, and how the university plans to keep 5,000 individuals safe in the middle of a pandemic, Elkins explained that she was ""not at liberty to demystify those,"" and referred people back to Bollinger's latest word salad.

Speaking to our reporters later in the evening, Lucas, SEAS '23, explained that he was overjoyed at the news. ""Every time I would get those emails I would wonder, has the PhD been demystified yet? I was starting to get worried. This is f*king huge"". 

A second student, William Cortez, noted the very personal effect this has had on his life. ""I always thought I wanted to study theater, become an actor, and follow my dreams, but after the forty fifth 'Happening now!!!' follow-up email I decided to get a PhD in Combinatorial Differential Geometry. I hope more students can see the light""."

1. how is the curriculum? are any of you guys premeds or know premeds who completed their major reqs, med school prereqs, AND core stuff in 4 years? i know that some people have, but how common is it to do so?
2. on that note, what majors are possible to complete? premed definitely limits things, and i am for sure NOT a hardcore stem person (no chem/bio major), so I was thinking public health, sociology, medical humanities (?) etc. if it isn't typically possible to complete med reqs/core/major in 4 years without a core stem major, then I would reconsider my plan to ed. 
   1. as far as minors, I assume I wouldn't need one because the core covers my interests already (humanities, writing, foreign language), but are minors even possible?
3. premedical/prehealth advising... I haven't heard amazing things about it. Would you say there's strong counseling/advising, or at least that the advising didn't *harm* you?
4. can you balance EC's and school? the student organizations here look awesome and I definitely want to get involved. on that note, what are the opportunities outside of school like? anything to be aware of or that's super cool, EC-wise?

more generally, though:

1. school spirit? how much is there? I haven't heard awesome things about it. While I do value a bit of unity, pride, and general happiness (yeah I'm a school spirit sucker sometimes), I don't absolutely need like crazy levels of it. since sports games and things like that aren't common things that draw the student body together... is everyone generally content? how would you rate student body 'closeness'? and what other aspects of student culture and school spirit exist that bring the student body together? I like independence, but I don't want a fully individual experience if that makes sense. 
2. on THAT note––mental health? stress culture? i'm used to high-competition and high-pressure environments, so I'm fine at tolerating this kind of thing, but how is mental health taken care of by admin? stupid wording, but I don't get super 'warm and cuddly' vibes from columbia, and with student strikes happening, etc etc, I'm curious about the stress culture, general closeness of the student body, and attitude of the admin. 
3. is the campus large enough? I can't visit before I apply, unfortunately, even though that is the one thing I think could answer a lot of my questions about environment. I love the fact that NYC is NOT a college town and is lively, but Columbia still has an insular, calm traditional campus. Is this enough of a balance?

Sorry this is so long, and if you take the time to answer even one of these, thank you!!!"

I've read a lot online about student's experiences and its usually pretty mixed, some feel included by others and some don't. i'm pretty outgoing so i'm not too worried about this. i'm sure I'd be able to make friends if i just put in a lot of effort.

for context, I'm  17 so I'm not the typical GS-er either, I graduated high school pretty early, already attended college, and have a unique story that disqualifies me for first-year consideration.  GS sounds pretty ideal on surface-level; I get to go to a reputable school while having a flexible schedule for work and to pursue my extracurriculars. however, two small things hold me back from applying

1. no access to CC/SEAS dorms. i have no problem having to live off campus but not even being able to access the dorms for events is kind of off-putting. Like I said, I'm 17, so i'd inevitably gravitate towards CC/SEAS students and would likely want to hang out in their dorms / lounge rooms for parties, studying, etc. I just cringe at the idea of having to ask someone to let me in every time. also I heard some school events are held specifically in CC/SEAS housing and even worse, some are marked specifically for CC/SEAS students :/
2. not as important but alumni kids apparently aren't considered legacies of Columbia. this makes no sense to me. if GS-ers take the exact same classes and earn the same degrees, why are their kids treated differently from CC/SEAS/Barnard kids? i don't know this just kind of rubs me the wrong way, it feels like a purposeful attempt to reinforce the idea that they're not actually as valued as the other students. i really hope i'm wrong though.

that's basically it. right now i'm pretty in the middle, I love the idea of Columbia but I was also offered admission into a similarly ranked school (uchicago) so I don't know if its even worth applying to columbia. i would love from input from anyone that has attended GS, but any insight is appreciated!"

I am really stressed at this moment because I did not get any financial aid. I have replied to all of the people who contacted me to congratulate me on my acceptance, but still haven’t gotten any sign of financial assistance. I am also contacting professors for availability of research opportunities but it seems like i will have to start school and create relationships for that to go smoothly.

Does anyone know how I should go about it? Who should I contact and how can i convince them to give me some financial assistance ? 

I’m really excited to have been accepted to this great school but I am afraid I might miss out on this incredible opportunity due to financial difficulties. 

The deadline to submit my enrollment deposit was extended to April 15th so I have till then to figure out if I can attend.

I graduated CC last spring and I’m going back to school for my CS master’s in the fall. I’m deciding between MS Express at Columbia and Stanford’s MSCS. The complication is that I don’t want to relocate to the west coast - so my option for Stanford is to do it part-time remotely while working full-time (they have a program for working professionals called HCP, you can’t just do full-time remote).

Columbia I’d finish in 1.5, maybe 2 years as a full-time student. Stanford I’d finish in about 3 years as a part-time student, and I’d have to do it while working.

What to do?

I've taken a look at the degree track and it looks like I'm almost a semester ahead in the track (due to the Chem track I took last semester as well as the whole 40-credit, tuition-free summer thing this year).  In an attempt to fill my schedule productively and also have some inkling of enjoyment, I was considering minoring in computer science.  

Here's the catch: I don't have prior experience with CS before coming to Columbia.  I took intro to python last semester and really did enjoy it.  It also seems like CS is just a good skill to have in general (especially as a stem major), and I feel like it might help me in the job field.  Nothing trumps experience in the field, of course, but I'm willing to fine-tune my computer skills if it'll make me a more attractive candidate.

I ended up with a B+ in intro to python last semester, so I'm not sure what that says about my abilities blindly coming into the CS field.  It doesn't look like I'll need to overdo my schedule too much to accommodate additional CS courses, and I think some of them \*may\* count for my nontech electives later on.  So I'm just wondering how plausible this plan is.  I've talked to multiple people with minimal to zero experience in the CS field who intend to major in CS, but I feel like having a separate major with no prior background in CS and an intended CS minor is a different animal.  I'm definitely willing to work (I say that now) to understand the material.  Is there anyone who's been in a similar situation or anyone who just has general advice/feedback on whether or not this is a good idea?"

I'd like to request that the r/Columbia mods consider adding a GS moderator since: 

1) Several of the current mods on this forum are inactive/unresponsive 

and 

2) GS accounts for a sizeable portion of Columbia's student body as well as a pretty substantial percentage of active users on this sub. 

Normally it wouldn't be a big deal if a few people make offhanded comments, since the perpetrators of these falsities are clearly out of touch with reality. However, the fact that they've been able openly disseminate blatantly fictitious assertions about GS (on top of their general contempt for the GS student body) is problematic because it can deter prospective GS students from embarking on a highly rewarding, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. 

I hesitate to go into further detail about my uniquely personal experiences as a  GS student due to the desire to maintain a semblance of anonymity; however, I will say that as someone who transferred from one of Columbia's peer institutions, I have zero regrets transferring to GS rather than electing to return to my previous institution or transfer to other programs I was accepted to. This is my first year as a GS student, and I've already been accepted into two nationally competitive STEM program opportunities that I hope will open even more doors in the future. 

Is GS perfect? No - the financial aid isn't great, which is my biggest gripe with the program. However, that's something that students and the administration are looking to change, and the benefits thus far have outweighed the cons for me personally. As long as you're proactive and make a concerted effort to seek and maximize the resources available to you, the opportunities as a GS student here are limitless."

Indisputably, the academic stats of the average GS admit are lower than those of the average CC admit (although this could partially be attributed to the size of the respective applicant pools). 

However, GS serves an entirely different student body. If the only significant difference between GS and CC was that GS is easier to get into and “a backdoor into Columbia,” GS would be filled with 18-year-olds fresh out of high school. It’s true that based on academic stats, many GS students “wouldn’t have been accepted out of High School,” but GS doesn’t exist to serve students coming from high school- *serving nontraditional students is the main point of the school’s existence*. (And as for GPAs once at Columbia, the school averages can speak for themselves.)

Cons UAH: based on several youtube review videos, the building is a bit old, have to get my own router, on the pricier side

Pro OCH: more options in general (facilities, price range), wider friendships(?) you get to know non-CLS roommates as well

Cons OCH: location may be far from campus, have to deal with property management by yourself

Would appreciate if anyone can give their insights based on real experience :)"

I'm looking into non-degree study at Columbia, more specifically a stay at Teacher's College as a foreign (non-US) exchange student on a Fulbright scholarship. Long story short, should I be selected for the scholarship, I will be limited to one or max. two semesters at whichever university the IIE will place me at. I do however have the option of listing my preferred destinations, which is why I'm trying to figure out in advance which of the institutions I find interesting admit non-degree students in the first place. Most renowned institutions seem to not offer this option besides special visiting scholar fellowships. I'm a master's student trying to take coursework, which seems to make things really difficult.

The info on the website says that admission is possible, but a) not all programs/courses will be available, b) I can take a max. of 16 credits, and c) financial aid, housing, academic advisement, and student visa sponsorship will not be available.

Overall, this seems to make for a very unpleasant exchange stay. Is there any piece of advice/any experiences anyone can share? Thanks!"

I know virtually everyone will be vaccinated, but while the vaccine is very effective at preventing serious illness/hospitalization, it's still possible to get sick with covid when vaccinated. And I'm thinking in such an environment it would be super easy to spread the virus through the food? And Columbia isn't a bubble, there are many people who venture off campus and into the city, and only 56% of New York City is fully vaccinated, so if even a few people get sick it would spread quickly through dining halls...

I suspect that the university is aware of risks of the delta variant and any others kicking around. I don't think that they are acting with our interests in mind and it freaks me out. Look, they make their choices in lockstep with the other ivies, and in consultation with a lock of very qualified and intelligent people, but the choices they make are not based on our welfare. 
I suspect the decision making process they have is based on the financial viability of the institutions and the choices they make are based on returns. When was the last time their consortium had to deal with a massive public health issue? The 1920s. How would the institution integrate public health into the incentives they have for the people who make the choices?
The cynical part of me would have thought that it could be is just trying to get people locked into leases and classes before the place shuts down a few weeks into the semester, but after I thought about it for a while. I think they did a cost benefit analysis and realized its worth it to reopen if a few elderly professors and administrators die, and some students suffer long term health consequences, now that's assuming everyone gets vaccinated, and we know its not going to happen. Assuming only 4% of people are impacted by breakthrough cases, 4% of over 35000 is a lot of people to sacrifice. Maybe it is worth it for some of us, but I think most of us are suffering from a normalcy bias about the risks. We also seem to suffer from an attribution bias in assigning who get sick and why.  
 I am really curious, has any university successfully opened without an outbreak happening? 
Does the university have a plan to offer booster shots? 
Will we have partial refunds for tuition and housing if we shift to back to online classes?
Will we still have to pay a fucking student life fee if its online? 
How are we going to organize, and are there already efforts to do so, if we want to insure we get our money's worth and due consideration for our welfare?"

Contact tracing indicates transmission is not occurring in the classroom. Instead, testing and tracing indicates that the main cause is students socializing unmasked at gatherings in residence halls and at off-campus apartments, bars and restaurants.

To slow the spread, beginning at 7 p.m. today:
- Students will only be able to swipe into their assigned residence hall.
Students will not be allowed to host guests. 
- Commuter access into residence halls will not be allowed.
- Social gatherings in indoor spaces will be limited to 10 students or less for Columbia College and Columbia Engineering students. Clubs and organizations are strongly encouraged to move all programming on-line or outdoors for the next two weeks.
- A random sample of undergraduates (increasing to 25%) will be selected each week and those selected individuals must get tested within one week of notification. 

We recognize this is a very sudden change, but we believe these temporary restrictions will address the current situation and help slow transmission. These changes will be imposed for a two-week period, at which time we will reevaluate and determine if they can be lifted or must continue.

Wear your masks indoors, on and off-campus, even when you are gathering with close friends. Help us slow COVID-19 transmission, and move our community to green!

Thank you."

First off, we missed in-person freshman year: the most “***crucial***” year (I believe) for forming friendships and building bonds. However, this isn’t to say that making friends from sophomore year and beyond is impossible. It’s just that with a relatively strong social foundation freshman year, it’s much easier to branch out and meet new people.

Now, sophomores are scattered all over campus and nyc. Some people are living off campus (as far as 109th), while the rest are living in different, isolated dorms. It’s not like freshman year where Columbia literally forces everyone to live on the main campus in either Wallach, Hartley, John Jay, Carman etc. where you’re bound to run into another student who wants to at least make small talk. The amount of times I’ve been in my building’s elevator, and my attempt to initiate a conversation is rejected, or flatly received by a group of friends (sophomores or juniors) who honestly could care less is comically embarrassing. 

These small, failed attempts at interaction make me wonder if I'm the problem. Deadass, I begin question what about my appearance or personality is preventing me from making friends. Is it the way I dress, my voice, the way I walk? 

With that being said, I don’t blame Columbia per say, but the timing of this pandemic truly did us dirty. People with “special circumstances” (**don’t even get me started**) were able to spend a semester — fall, spring or summer — or even the entire year making friends and exploring the city. While other students, who didn’t lie about having special reasons to be on campus during a pandemic, chose to stay home for the sake of public health and safety

Sophomore year starts and the playing field isn’t equal. For the students who stayed home last year, it feels as if we’re at a new school where everyone else already knows each other and we’re the odd one out. During freshman year, everyone is the **NEW KID** and everything is so alien. This is where the bonding occurs; “*we’re all new at this so let’s stick together, let's help each other out until we find our footing*” 

I hate to say it, but these sophomore friend groups aren’t budging. They know who they want in their circle and that’s that. They don’t mind making acquaintances in their classes or on their floor. But when the weekend rolls around, nobody is calling you to make dinner plans or hang out in the city. 

A part of me wishes that I over-exaggerated just a little or I played some kind of team sport for Columbia. that so I could have been on campus last year. all the teams seems so tight knit

Before the same ""put yourself out there"" advice begins to flood my comments, please trust and believe, I’m doing just that. I've joined clubs, attended socials/events and have even spoken to random strangers. It’s not easy... especially as a sophomore who is essentially working from scratch while many others seem to have their lives entirely together. 

For anyone else (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, grad student, person who occasionally walks through campus) who feels like their struggling socially, know that you aren't alone and you're loved. It only gets worse from here so hold onto hats! 

God bless✨🥂 - a tired sophomore"

I'm in a situation where I successfully found a faculty advisor, and he outlined the expectations.  However, with a simple report due at the end and evaluation from my lab, it seems like a hit-or-miss type grade, which is extremely risky especially when there are no rubrics.

So I'm taking a certain class this semester and it is the first time here at Columbia I've felt like the grading and overall handling of the class by the TAs, specifically the head TA, is awful, unjust, and incompetent. Let's say the head TAs name is ""Dexter""

During my time at Columbia, virtually every class I'm in has had AMAZING TAs. But not this time. I've spoken to a few of my friends who have TA'd and they told me the experience in the class was against most standard practices they have seen. This was how Dexter ran the grading of the Midterm:

&amp;#x200B;

* Dexter graded 2/3's of ALL problems on the midterms for ALL 114 students in the class 
* The average for the problems Dexter graded was 40%, the median was 30%, and the standard deviation was 35% (!!!!!!!), meaning a significant portion of students received lower than 20%.
* Dexter told us if a student didn't do well on the first few problems on the midterm, he wouldn't spend much time grading a student's later problems.
* Dexter emphasized his midterm grading strategy was to grade as fast as possible 
* If you received a 0 on a problem, Dexter left no comments on what you did wrong. To clarify this, Dexter sent us all an email saying if you got a 0 on a problem you should ""study the solutions"".
* When you received partial credit on a problem the comments Dexter left were either a single word like ""wrong"" or a single ""X"" over a part of our solutions.
* If you had a correct solution that was different than what the professor's solutions manual had, you either received minimal partial credit, or Dexter gave a 0.
* Midterms were NOT graded anonymously 
* Dexter conducts his office hours on Zoom with his camera off
* Dexter's advice when a student in office hours asked what they could do to do better was ""put in the work, this is a hard class. Some students did well on the Midterm."" This is in fact, an introductory course required for many majors.
* When students asked how a low Midterm score would affect their grade, Dexter told us ""I don't know, it will be curved."" When asked how the curve would work he said ""I don't know.""
* The midterm is 35% of our overall grade.

I could keep going because there are some other major problems with how Dexter is running the class, but that should give you an idea. What are our options? He's such a bad TA he almost feels like a parody of bad TAs."

I would like to point out that in addition to voting for our representatives in local, state, and federal governments on November second, New York State voters are also being asked to vote on 5 proposals. If you are a Columbia student who is registered to vote in New York, please, please, please familiarize yourself with these proposals so that you go to the voting booth informed. I've summarized the proposals below, but more detailed info can be found here: https://www.voting.nyc/meet-the-candidates/2021-ballot-proposals/

AND on the NYTimes website of you have a subscription: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2021/10/30/nyregion/new-york-election-ballot-measures.amp.html

Here are the ballot proposals in brief:

Proposal #1 (the most complicated one!)  All of the five bulleted statements below are included in this proposal #1:
-Allow for an independent redistricting committee to have more time to submit their proposals to the legislature for approval before these proposals need to be acted on 
-Allow for a simple majority approval of redistricting proposals instead of 2/3 vote when one political party is in the majority in both houses of the legislature
-Count incarcerated people in the districts in which they last resided (not in the districts in which they are currently inprisoned) for the purpose of redistricting. 
-Require that the state count non-citizen residents as a part of it's population should the federal census fail to do so.
-Cap the number of state senators at 63
A YES vote supports these changes. A NO vote opposes these changes. 

Proposal #2:  Creates a state constitutional right to clean air, clean water, and a healthful environment (A YES vote supports adding a right to clean water, clean air, and a healthful environment to the New York Constitution's Bill of Rights. A NO vote does the opposite.) 

Proposal #3: Authorizes the legislature to pass a law for same day voter registration. (A YES vote supports same day voter registration and a NO vote opposes same day registration.) 

Proposal #4: Authorizes the legislature to pass a law for no-excuse absentee voting--aka it gives people more access to absentee ballots--you don't need to be traveling, sick, or have a disability to qualify. (A YES vote supports no-exuse absentee ballots voter and a NO vote opposes no-excuse absentee ballots.) 

Proposal #5: Increases the NYC Civil Court's jurisdiction from civil cases involving $25,000 to $50,000. (From my own research, there seems to be bipartisan agreement that voting YES would be beneficial to the ability of our judicial system to function well and to reduce the backlog of cases.) A YES vote supports this increase and a NO vote opposes the increase."

As a student I am in complete support of this strike and I encourage the line to be held. I'm not going to class today, I'm posting up in a public library and doing my work. Get those benefits, get the fair pay, and take the f****** misconduct cases to a 3rd party where they can't get covered up and we can get justice. 

HOWEVER, in the interest of garnering the most support and putting the most pressure on the University to negotiate, is calling for students not to attend the University helping? I really don't think so and here is why in the most succinct way I can put it:

1. Your absence as workers that are essential to the running of this institution is MOST felt when things are running at 100% capacity. I feel students should be encouraged to go to class, demand it be in person and not made easier by zoom, that assignments go on as usual, exams as usual, and that grading be returned on time. This will put immense pressure on the University to buckle and meet your demands. Spend this time getting more student workers to strike with you and boycott their duties so the pressure builds.

2. Telling students not to go to school during finals season at the place they are paying thousands of dollars to attend is not going to grow support and actually takes some pressure off the University. They're still getting the tuition money from the students, now its requiring one less day of instruction for them. Students are getting fed up and some are starting to turn or become neutral. I imagine this is what the University wants, it actually puts pressure on you to settle as the movement loses momentum from the decreasing support and solidarity you should be receiving. Your voice is starting to lose volume as the thousands of supporters who were once completely backing you, begin to grow quiet.


This is just what I observe. I think your message and demands are something all students can get behind. This act of protest seems pretty standard in the progression of activism, but it is different in that we can't take back our status as patrons to the institution. What we can do is make them feel your absence more strongly, and that is done by giving our full attendance and voicing our demand to receive the value of what we have already paid for."

**long version:**

Many people who graduate from Columbia go into finance or work at Google.

All Columbia grads I know tell me they don't like their job, but it pays the bills. Why do they do it?

Because *their jobs pay a* ***living wage.***

The reason people don't do what they want to is because in order to stay alive as an adult, you have to make money for rent and food.

This strike could encourage more employers to pay living wages.

I'm lonely. Really lonely. Sorry if this comes off as desperate, but it is the truth. When I was accepted to Columbia, I thought I would have the opportunity to get to know interesting people and finally be around hard-working, like-minded people like myself. I thought people would finally ""get"" me here.

Unfortunately, things haven't turned out this way. As a GS student, I feel more like an outsider than being part of the group. There was even an occasion where I thought I was starting to make friends with a certain individual, we even hung out and studied together once, and had more plans to hang out in the future. The second I told him I was a GS student, I was ghosted. Now he acts like I don't even exist in our class. 

Perhaps I have no real objective in posting this. I just need to vent. But I am really lonely and would love to get to know some people. People who won't exclude me and make me feel like an outsider for being a GS student."

**tl;dr** I have a red pass, and no one knows why or how to get rid of it

**long version**

* On Thursday night, we were told that on Friday, we needed to get tested before 3PM. 
   * There were no testing spots available on Friday before 3PM when I checked.
* On Monday morning, I got a red pass. 
* I got tested at 10:20 AM on Monday.
* I got a green pass at 4:00 PM. 
   * Don't worry, it gets interesting after this...
* I emailed covidtesttrace saying I got tested at 6:00 PM on Monday.
* covidtesttrace sent ""Thanks"" to my email at 6:00 PM on Monday.
* On Tuesday, at 10:42 AM, I had a **red** pass. 
* I called CUIT twice. They said - sucks, try to get tested again.
* I go to Lerner. I'm not allowed to get tested again today because I got tested yesterday.

I missed all my classes yesterday and I will miss them today too. Awesome."
rc3s06,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/rc3s06/the_strike_today_was_inspiring/,The strike today was inspiring,26,231,2021-12-08 15:20:42,"As an undergraduate student, I am seeing a lot of talk from people who were not at the picket line today and lots off rumors that there was harassment and physical violence. There could have been a lot that happened that I didn’t see but the people claiming this “heard this from their friend” are not helping provide any clarity. 

As someone who was actually at the picket line I saw some students try to make their way through the picket line and were met with people holding their hands. I saw other students get more violent and the picketers naturally push them away. One graduate student was hit by a bike and I have seen no mention of the fact that students crossing the line are the ones inciting an act of violence against first if, they touch another person. Don’t do this. The world wasn’t going to end. It was one day and all your teachers know the situation. 

Secondly, if you don’t like it contact the admin who has all the power of ending this. Quit victim blaming the people who are standing up for themselves when they have subpar conditions at one of the richest universities in the world. I have been poor my whole life and am lucky to be here but it doesn’t mean it’s what we deserve. The first day I arrived my advisor told me the school could go tutoring free for decades and still remain in business. Think about what would have happened if all of you writing on Twitter and Reddit just messaged the admin and helped make the university a better environment for the people who are actually creating a large part of the value for your prestigious university. We likely would all be better off. Solidarity forever!"
rc7ei8,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/rc7ei8/considering_the_strike/,Considering the strike,14,52,2021-12-08 18:26:58,"In general, I am in favor of workers advocating for their rights and using their means of leverage to bargain. I'm extremely skeptical of the university administration, and I would guess that there is a good amount of room for better pay for student workers. However, I am a little perturbed by the language that is being put out there about the (supposedly unlivable) conditions of the student workers. So, I regretfully have a few points that I can't seem to think my way out of, and I'd like to get some perspective on these ideas from others. Before jumping in I should probably say, I give no truck to deception or bullying. Using specific styles of movement-based rhetoric does not excuse deception or bullying. 

1: Ph.D. students are not ""working class."" Ph.D. students are temporary part-time workers (I, like the union, am making a distinction between teaching and research). My understanding is that most of them work 8 out of 12 months a year for a few years of their program (and that those who work 12 months make at or over the living wage being talked about). They are not part of the ""working class"" and to compare their payment/benefits to that of full-time, blue-collar workers seems pretty deceptive (especially considering they are also getting a degree that ostensibly holds a lot of value and they are often taking very expensive classes for free). I do not see a strong corollary between student workers and factory workers, service industry workers, social workers, etc., and co-opting the language of working-class movements seems to me to imply that this is a working-class group.

2: This will not benefit the tuition-paying students. It can be argued all day long whether or not the current American university structure is a good model, but it is the one we have. If the cost of operations goes up, the cost of tuition/fees will undoubtedly go up. Perhaps the tuition payers who work for the university will see an increase in pay, but in general, this is going to increase the cost for tuition payers (I'm thinking of the GS and masters students especially, who do not receive full need-based financial aid). Again, I don't have a problem with self advocation, I'm just not convinced this will benefit tuition payers, and I suspect it will increase their costs. Please remember I am talking about the real and immediate effects of this specific situation not about labor relations in general.

3: The strikes will never end. I am not at all convinced that the grad students will ever stop striking (not continuously, but rather every few years). The rotating strikes seem especially likely if this strike is perceived as a success. Due to the nature of student life, there will be a new cast of grad students every several years. Since this university seems to attract very ideologically minded students, I am having trouble imagining a time when a new group of grad students will be devoid of a large enough contingent of activist-minded students to resist the urge to do another strike. This is potentially signaling that a vocal minority can dictate when the rest of the university can and can't operate.

4: Having outside arbitrators for sexual harassment cases is not as simple of a request as it is being made out to be. I don't have much more to say about this, as it seems pretty self-evident that the university admin is going to say no when the request is framed as, ""should the university give the power to fire or punish its faculty to someone else?"""

I’m just a student who deals with their own stuff, and whose life is being disrupted by this movement in often tactless ways. 

A few points 

1) The demands 

The movement has done a poor job of communicating their demands and putting them front and center in their struggle. Their website is mostly donation prompts and student testimonies, and within all the chanting, picketing, disruptions and slogans, the actual demands rarely seep through. (I know they are not actually hard to find but I’m communicating to you what the experience of almost every student around me is) 


2)You are a part of a huge community with many moving parts, even if we support your demands, it doesn’t mean you can make everything about yourself.


3)the tree lighting 🌲 

I and many others found it very tactless and unnecessary for the strikers to take THE ONE EVENT we had as community together and to make it about themselves. And what for? We all already knew you’re fighting and supported the general cause.

Also, that night they held up a giant ‘get the NYPD off campus’ sign, and made SURE it is the background in the video of every Acappella group. And that night one of their own and our own was violently murdered. You are fighting for better working conditions, please don’t think you have any right to dictate how public safety is conducted. 

4)shutting down the last day of some classes.

We won’t have our last class, won’t get to wrap up the semester properly, and to say thanks to our professors and classmates. Do I understand the entire rationale behind their decision? No I don’t. But do they have the right to do whatever they want just because they can justify it to themselves? 


I am not 10 feet deep in this, I don’t know or particularly care to know about every detail of this struggle and this back and fourth. 

You have the right to fight for better wages and working conditions, and that fight can be disruptive. But have some tact and some respect for regular students and their experience."

Have never really thought about this until seeing the Grad students strike's points on insurance quality, but is it legal for the university to basically force international students to pay for what is a substandard insurance that people who are getting it for free are not satisfied with? I've looked around slightly and it's immediately apparent the Aetna plan underperforms and costs more than comparables.
