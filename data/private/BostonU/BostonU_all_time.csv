I'm a current freshman here at BU and I've been playing paintball for about 3 years now. Right off the bat, I'm not that good at the game and definitely have room to improve in all aspects. But, I am wondering if anybody on this subreddit would be open to try and start either a club or team on campus. If any BU alum from '08 and before, during the time in which BU did have a competing paintball team, could provide any knowledge/information that would be great too.

For all the BU redditors that don't know what paintball is, taken straight from the Wiki, it is ""a game developed in the 1980s in which players eliminate opponents from play by hitting them with dye-filled, breakable, oil and gelatin paintballs, or pellets, usually shot from a carbon dioxide or compressed air (Nitrogen) powered “paintball marker/gun”."""

6m7xww,https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonU/comments/6m7xww/psa_to_incoming_freshman_worried_about_their/,PSA to incoming freshman worried about their schedule,44,5,2017-07-09 08:14:40,"First - welcome to BU! :) Second, I've been seeing a lot of anxiety and overthinking lately.

Here are a couple pieces of advice I have for scheduling as a recent graduate:

➡ You can't always know if your schedule will be too hard or too easy. You can look at the syllabus or ask others, but it's all about what you can handle. If you end up not liking a professor, hate the timing, or don't like to rush from building to building, you'll figure out your own rhythm through experience and adjust for the future.

➡ Inevitably, you may end up with a schedule that you just have to power through if you need to take required classes. You can only switch around so much. Don't avoid taking a class you really need to take just because you don't think you want it on your schedule. Each major is different; for example, as an English major it was important for me to snap up the class I wanted to take even though I didn't like the timing because the higher level classes were only offered certain semesters.

➡ Be mindful of the time it takes to get from building to building. A new policy was enacted last semester that now allows 15 mins between classes instead of 10. However, I would be careful if your class is in West and your next one is in East. Before classes start, I would highly recommend for you to go through your schedule in order from building to building so you can see how much time it would take you. If it feels a little tight, talk to your professor about the timing. Some are sticklers about being on time and others understand that the campus is big. 

➡ You can only glean so much from a RateMyProfessor review. I wouldn't say that you should avoid taking the class completely or switch out to another professor, but don't let it spook you. I've taken classes with professors who had supposedly positive - or negative - reviews, and they ended up being the opposite. That's not to say these ratings are incorrect, but it's important to keep in mind what your own preferences are. And ask us here on the sub if you're worried about a Prof, too. 

➡ Please leave good space to have your meals. Health is extremely important, trust me. Skipping meals just to get in that class or thinking you can just pack a protein bar and deal with it is unacceptable. Your physical and mental health will power your success. The same concept applies to getting in a little exercise every day. Even 20-30 min of walking briskly outside will disrupt the grind.

➡ Finally, don't compare yourself with your friends. People love to talk about how shitty or how easy their schedules are. But their classes aren't your problem. You're at BU to have fun and learn, but also to work at your own pace, not others'. Don't buy into scheduling a class with a friend 'just because' if it messes up your own goals. Don't buy into having fun 'study sessions' if you concentrate better alone. Learn to firmly say no. You have your own agenda. 

Let me, your advisor, or someone else know if you're having trouble with balancing classes. BU also offers a slew of mental and physical health support, so take advantage of it and don't be ashamed to reach out. It's better to nip problems in the bud. Everyone's here to help you succeed."

An accountability group designed to beat Procrastination?,16,1,2017-09-09 16:47:14,"TLDR: I have an idea to start a small productivity group where the only rule is that you can never miss our pre agreed meetup times or get kicked out. You can also pay a fine for breaking your commitment. By keeping each other accountable to sitting down and working, we can beat procrastination together. 

Hi all, 

I had this idea and wanted to post it here to see if it gains some interest. If interested, PM me! 

I’ve been struggling with Procrastination for a long time and have really learned through research and experimenting on myself that for certain people external accountability is absolutely crucial - not even nice to have or helpful, but necessary. When you graduate high school though, that accountability is slowly removed, especially if you are self-employed or a student with no-one really overseeing how you spend your time. Knowing your test is in 2 weeks is good enough to get your butt in action 2 days before, but wouldn’t it be nice if you could have the same motivation 2 weeks prior to when you start panicking? Accountability really is the key for me when it comes to moving forward and I suspect it must be for some of you as well. I thought about the idea of creating an Anti-Procrastination Study/Work Group. Here’s how it could potentially look like: 

- A small group of maybe 3-5 people who understand how important external accountability is to keep you on target.
- We would all commit to a sacred time slot that works (maybe 3x a week for 2-3 hours) at a coffee shop or any other good work environment
- When we meet we would start by each saying what we want to accomplish in this time slot (i.e. read 40 pages, or do my math homework, write my essay, etc..) - your personal work. We are together to oversee that we are working but we work on our own stuff.  
- I would suggest we use Pomodoro technique for max productivity and to sync our breaks (I’ve found Pomodoro to really kick ass - if you don’t know what it is, I can teach you. It’s super easy and life changing.) 
- At the end we show our work to others. We can also separate some time to talk about productivity and strategies to become even more productive as a group. I feel like a guru on the subject by having to read so much on it already. Happy to help anyone who needs help. 
- Finally, but most importantly: In order to keep you accountable and help you get your butt in gear even if you aren’t feeling it, if you break your commitment to the group and don’t show up to the sacred time slot we agreed upon for our productivity sessions, you get the ultimate consequence: 
    - Consequence 1: You lose your slot in our group. Sounds tough but it’s the only way we keep each other honest about committing to beat procrastination together. When your motivation to work is low, the groups job is to remind you that motivation is bullshit and the key to success is showing up and just starting, day in day out, consistently, until it becomes a habit. So, show up or go back to living the life of procrastination. 
    - Another idea: Maybe if you break your commitment but don’t want to get kicked out of the awesome group, we can impose a penalty like paying a $50 fine  for committing the unforgivable sin. We can use the money to buy snacks and coffee for the group. 

Is this something that people would be interested in? PM me to gage interest. Honestly I think that with 3 people we can get something sweet going. 

Peace and fuck procrastination. "

I also knew that while my parents were sending some money what they did send me couldn't get me much because of the ridiculous prices due the high minimum wage here, I couldn't ask for more money as I was already taxing my family. They are glad I’m here and want to support me but they only have so much. Everything else seems like a domino effect, my social life consists of having nothing more than classmate acquaintances, because I’m pretty dang shy and rarely talk to people. By no means, I’m not socially inept but it’s hard to relate to people here, so even if people tried talking to me and inviting me I would just say I am busy which always works.
 
Apart from all that my class assignments keep pulling the rug under me. It's not like classes were hard it’s just that the material goes past my head most of the time. When I do talk to professors most don’t give much help except ""study with friends"", ""grab a study partner"", ""go here and get help"" “come to office hours more” which I get that most of the time these solutions work, it’s hard to follow up from there. Now I simply try doing the work I can the best way I can but even then sometimes I miss the mark by a wide margin. 
So I failed the assignment mentioned in an earlier post. The 30% one, I think the 30% assignment was the one that sealed the deal with me where everything culminated into my nervous breakdown. So in response I dropped that class. I have to keep myself healthy mentally at least.

When I signed up for B.U I never thought it be this tough to adjust. This school sold me an illusion and when it shattered, I lost my marbles. So now I’m beginning the process to get the heck outta here as I doubt I can make it past one year here. Seems like the best thing to do is transfer outta here while my transcript is somewhat decent minus that W, and go to a local college and continue there. After all, the familiarity means that all my problems here won’t be so exacerbated there. I know where to get a job and where some old friends that go that college I’m transferring to and meet up with them. Its not a happy ending but its agreeable. It’s not like I’m mad at the school or the university or anything or blaming myself, it’s just that I'm disillusioned. So I’m getting while the getting’s good.

From,
A disillusioned student at B.U

So first week of this semester (which was my first week ever on campus) I decided to go to Mugar to study and print something out. I go to the computers, log in, open up the item I needed to print, and then send it to the printer. So, being my first time in the library and first time printing something, I didn't know how to get the paper I supposedly printed. I get up and look around, and lo and behold I see the printing desk. So my thought process at this point is, ""Okay, it must be that this is where you get your papers"" So I walk up to the desk and see what LOOKS like some sort of card scanner. ""Oh, so you just put your BU ID card in the scanner and then the paper gets printed and handed to you"" Is what I was thinking. So I walk up there like a retard and just put my card in the scanner. Next thing you know some guy who works at the printing desk practically screams, ""What are you doing?!"" It turns out that the card reader was some sort of convoluted fucking stapler. What type of fucking stapler looks like that? Seriously. So, in my embarrassed frenzy I leave the library pretty quickly. I ended up finding a printer on sale at target and I've been using that since (it kinda sucks ass though). Basically, my question is, do you guys think enough time has passed for me to be able to go to Mugar without the dude who saw me trying to staple my terrier card recognizing me? "

Coming into freshman year, I thought college would be super transformative for me, that I would come into myself as a person, and learn new things/have new experiences.

I joined so many clubs and tried to get so involved, but it turned up with nothing. I'm very extroverted and I probably talked to a couple new people a week, but it just seems like everyone has groups already. Either that or I just don't have much to talk about with them.

I'm just so confused as to how I found so many close friends in a high school, but I can't find even one in this huge school in the middle of a city. It's so isolating and I nearly want to give up trying to talk to people, because it just ends up making me feel lonelier because no one can seem to relate to me. It's really painful and I don't know how to be happy in a place where I'm so alone no matter what I do.

I am a 23 year old graduate student at the Law School entering my second year. I didn't really push myself too much socially last year, and as a result, have not developed any friendships comparable to the ones I had in undergrad. What are some recommendations for making new friends here as a graduate student?

I assume joining student-run clubs would be a good starting point.  But I'm not sure if they're open to graduate students or if they are strictly for undergrads only.  I also worry about doing anything that is too much of a commitment, as law school keeps me very busy (especially as the semester progresses). I'd appreciate any and all club recomendations that worked for you guys. 

As far as my interests go, I am particularly interested in sports and fitness. I am relatively athletic, have over a decade of martial arts experience, rowed for my undergrad crew team, and am a huge Patriots fan. I am also interested in learning new skills such as cooking or painting (no promise I'm any good at either though). I used to be big into parties and bars in undergrad, but have since lost interest in them. That being said, I am happy to go out at night in a limited manner.

Hours were super flexible, the location is really convenient for anyone living at West (equipment room is in the basement of Rich), and most importantly, the work is super easy. Honestly I only worked like 30% of the actual shift time, the rest was spent doing homework or playing videogames (there's a simple table with some chairs for students when there's no clothes to be washed). The faculty are really nice and funny to be around. So if you aren't averse to washing/drying sweaty laundry I'd recommend applying once the work study board opens sometime in August.

It’s right on campus and even if you’re far the East side, it’s covered by the MBTA and the BU Shuttle. 

I’ve had an awful experience dealing with their pharmacy and I know I’m not alone in that. I’ve recently (past few years) had to start taking medicine on a daily basis which some can have *huge* withdrawawl effects from if they don’t take their medicine. 

The last time I picked up my regular dose, I was given half of my regular prescription (2 weeks rather than a month). When I went to re-request my order on their site, they wouldn’t let me reorder again - no biggie, I had some extra. When I was running low, I tried again and got an email confirmation.

Four days later, on my last dose, I walk into CVS to ask if they have my prescription ready (the prescription was scheduled to be ready Sunday, but I hadn’t gotten a text yet about my prescription being ready): they don’t. I’m told they’ll call me in half an hour after they sort things out on their end.

Almost an hour later with no word, I go back in to ask about my prescription. I’m told “Hey, it’s a long story.” I ask what that means. “We had a software glitch.” I again ask what that means for getting my medication. I’m told they’ll call my doctor’s office. Knowing they generally don’t have my medication on hand, I then (again) have to ask if that means they’ll be able to fill the prescription today. 

Five hours later, with my parents making calls to the CVS to make sure things go through (I had to head back to class), as well as to my doctor’s, my prescription was finally refilled (initially at the wrong dose before more calls were made) and  I  again have to head back over to the CVS from east campus.


**TL;DR:** The Comm Ave CVS pharmacy is close and convenient, but isn’t the best. If you’re taking medication where never missing a dose is important, I would be hesitant to use them. I’ll be looking into other pharmacies for my next refill, even if I have to go off campus to get my prescription refilled."

1. **Courses**. The most obvious of them all, but BU is of high ranking in every school. Communications, Questrom, Sargent, and more are all amazing and the classes and professors are high quality (for the most part).

2. **Food**. Not only are Boston restaurants top quality, but the dining halls are actually really good compared to other schools. Many, many other colleges use catering services like Sodexo (disgusting) but Boston University actually has their own food service which they wrote about in depth on their website. The staff is amazing and while the food isn’t 5 stars, it’s the best you’ll get so far as a college dining goes.

3.**Parties**. BU may seem like it can only be so fun given that it’s in a city, but the bars and Allston are dope. Depending on the house in Allston, traditional frat parties can be really fun, whereas for 21+ students (don’t even try using a fake), the bars are the classier alternative for going out and getting turnt.

4.**Boston**. The city is one of the most unique in the world, with so much to do and so much history behind it. You’re across the river from MIT, down the street from BC, and a drive away from Harvard. Boston Common is beautiful nearly year round, and the financial district is really fun to just chill and walk around in. Tons of amazing restaurants and shopping around Newbury street and Downtown Boston as well.

5.**Transportation**. So many options. Walking, the T, Uber, Blue Bikes, and more. Really easy to get around and super convenient. 

———————————————————————

Cons:

1. **Money**. BU is expensive and more often than not do the students feel that the school doesn’t put the money to good use. Seems that the school is more concerned with spending the money on pointless stuff and rarely makes an effort to spend on any social events, new facilities, etc. Annoying.

2. **School Spirit**. God awful school spirit. For our “best” sport (hockey) (that we suck at), nobody comes out to the games. It’s so dead and only when we play BC do people make the effort to come support. It’s embarrassing seeing Agganis a quarter full for a D1 sport at a 34,000 person school. 

3.**Campus**. Not your traditional campus. Literally just a long road with a bunch of buildings on either side. No fields to chill on or play pickup sports really.

I reply, “I’m just tryna take a shit”, to which he chuckled. I walked out of the stall and the mouse was gone. I immediately felt guilty for kicking this poor mouse, because it’s not like it would actually hurt me(maybe?). This is my confession."

I graduated BU in 2016 and now live in North Carolina, but this still eats me alive every day. 
I became friends with this homeless man named Herb. He used to sit on a stoop on Commonwealth Ave closer to Allston and by Brown Sugar Cafe. Had a kind of Santa look to him with his big belly and white hair and beard. When I told him that I would be graduating soon, he asked me to come by and see him no matter what. I promised him with the full intention of doing so. 
Graduation day came and the weather sucked ass (thanks, Boston). It was cold, windy, and a bit drizzly. I legitimately did not think Herb would come out in such weather. But alas, as I'm driving away with my family, I see him at his stoop waiting in the cold, looking left and right to find me. I told my parents to wait so I can say hi to a friend. But, Commonwealth was a nightmare with the graduation and didn't have a chance to really pull over without going way out of the way. My parents told me to just text my friend later. So we just drove away. 
I have not stopped thinking about it since. So if any one of you see Herb still sitting on his stoop, I'd love to know.

Can BU for once highlight a student who is working 30 hours a week just to be here and pay their bills? All while taking a full course load and attempting to have a social life? That would be nice.

I am really not trying to fish for compliments here. But I know there are others like me and we should know each other exist.

Feel free to add your own advice and ask questions. Maybe we can label our comments ADVICE or QUESTION too so that it doesn’t get confusing.

Abbreviations used here: 
Work study = WS
Non-work study = NWS

NWS jobs
Absolutely use the part time job finder on the student link. If you want a job you really gotta put yourself out there. If you are looking for a job in a specific area, look in that category and the on-campus category. Sometimes employers don’t put them in the right spot. If you are desperate, look in the other categories too to double check. This might even work to your advantage. The on-campus category gets updated with new jobs almost everyday. My strategy was to apply to as many listings as possible, granted that I saw it would be a fit, they would pay me enough and that I would be happy there. It was a pain and time consuming but it paid off.


LOCAL INCOMING FRESHMAN 
My very first job at BU was through the local incoming students WS program before my first semester even started. My year at least, there was practically no competition and I picked the job out of a list they had. I highly recommend this program!!

INCOMING FRESHMAN IN GENERAL
You can get hired before you start classes too! I applied and got hired to at the GSU and another job during the same summer, but started when school began. WS and NWS available

SUMMER JOBS
It seems that it’s much easier to get a job during the summer, so definitely take advantage of that if you have the opportunity. Employers really go crazy when you hit em with the, “I can work through the summer and fall semester.” Sometimes they get real desperate during winter break, but that also requires you to find your own housing if you are in a dorm.
WS and NWS available

GENERAL ADVICE
The name of the game is applying often. Straight away send them an email with your resume or CV, schedule with an explanation of when you are willing to work, cover letter if they ask for it, and a nice sweet and short email expressing that you really want to work for them. If they see your schedule does not fit, they will tell you and save you a hell of a lot of time. To save time, make a template for office jobs, research jobs, other jobs etc and make a copy your resume that is customized to fit each category. Now you only have to adjust your materials slightly to match each individual listing. 

NEXT STEPS
Make sure to keep track of when and where you have applied, keeping the original job description, contact info, and proposed pay rate. It’s kinda awkward if you apply somewhere twice or if the employer deletes the listing while still talking to you. If you get an interview, study this stuff and really make sure to pepper in your knowledge of the position and show that you know your responsibilities already. If you get the job, make sure you remember to update your resume with this info right away.

Since it's June, and people are probably freaking out over having chosen BU for school (and its big $$$ check), I wanted to share some of the tips and tricks I used when I got here as a destitute college student.

Either way, if you're poor as fuck, stingy as fuck, or just really into saving money and living the life of the broke-ass student, take these tips and use them as your own.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some of the easier basics for saving (and earning) $$$:**

1. For God's sake, don't eat out. It's cool now that you have autonomy over what to eat and do with no parental supervision, but you also have to factor in tip and tax, not to mention just paying for eating out. Boston is expensive; don't be stupid and spend $20 on dinner.
2. If you have a work-study, the BU on-campus job board opens in mid to late August. BU will hire basically anyone even if your resume (or lack of one) sucks ass. They pay minimum wage (but the minimum for office jobs are like $12, so it's not like you're making McDonald's wages), but you're guaranteed a job where your boss gets that you're a student, the work is minimal, you can probably study while making money, AND the chance of you getting fired for having to skip a shift or leaving early to study for an exam is practically non-existent. Try skipping multiple shifts to study while working an outside job - it sure as hell won't fly.
3. If you DON'T have a work-study, you should still be fine. BU prefers work-study, but as long as you can prove that you have half a brain, can speak competent English, and aren't a complete sociopath during an interview or email, you should get hired. 
4. Quickie Jobs (or quick jobs nowadays?) work if you're super short on change, but I find them to be annoying and frustrating to get, especially since you need to go to West to the job office (881 I think) and get the referral before you can even call or email the person for the quick job. And then you have to follow up on whether or not you got the job. Fucking asinine for $20.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tips for food (a.k.a. stealing from the dhalls and therefore BU):**

I'm going to assume most students are living in dorms (non-commuters and non-apartment people, although these can still work if you have friends with dining hall swipes).

1. Take as many oranges as you can possibly steal. Oranges last usually a week to two weeks (in my experience) if you store them right. They're quick snacks, last longer than apples or bananas, and you won't get scurvy (v important).
2. Just take the whole packages of bread behind the bread/bagel areas. I'm basing this off of Marciano (Bay State dhall), but the employees literally keep the entire bags of bread and bagels behind the toasters, and I've taken loaves and loaves of whole wheat bread. And bagels. Also, for butter, cream cheese, whatever - just get a bowl, scoop out however much you want, put that shit into some tupperware, and store it in your mini fridge.
3. Speaking of fridges - just buy your own mini. BU Free &amp; For Sale FB page has multiple listings for like half and quarter of retail prices. Please don't buy that shit full price.
4. If you're like me, and you prefer to work more than you eat, get the cheapest 250 meal plan. You get a ridiculous amount of dining points, and you can use them at 10 Buick Market for groceries, basic shower supplies, cleaning supplies, etc. You also get like a meal a day, which if you steal like I do, should suffice. Save the dining points for Bay State Underground for meals after work and after the dhall closes, and for basic house supplies. 
5. Lastly, invest in some glass tupperware. I have stolen weeks worth of meals from Marciano just by taking whole meals, storing them in glass tupperware, and freezing them for two or three days when money's tight. This works for pasta, rice, most vegetables, meat, etc. Glass tupperware usually works better, imo, but do you.
6. I've also just taken a 72 oz. water bottle (those bigass ones for $9 at Marshalls, T.J. Maxx, etc.) and gone ham on the orange juice dispenser. Alternatively, I've also just taken coffee, whole pints of half and half/milk/lactaid/whatever, and tea bags and sugar. Free coffee and tea for months.

&amp;#x200B;

**Finding $$$ for Laundry, Convenience Points, and Whatnot:**

1. Ask your parents for quarters. Ask your uncles and aunts for quarters. Ask your neighbors, your dog, your grandparents, your friends, *everyone.* I fucking hate using convenience points for laundry, and it takes forever in the laundry room anyways.
2. I put $100 of con. points at the beginning of each semester, and that's that. Don't add more, don't add less. It'll help you budget and keep you on track for what you're spending. Best part is that they roll over, so if you have extra at the end of the year, more power to you.

&amp;#x200B;

**Budgeting (or learning how to):**

If you've never had to budget before, let me introduce you to the Marie Kondo of budgets.

1. Set up your own bank account or credit union. I use Capital One, since they're pretty student friendly, and there are multiple branches in Brookline and Boston. Every paycheck, set up an automatic transfer from your checking to your savings account so you have a rainy day fund. I had an emergency GERD attack during class once, and my insurance wouldn't cover the charges at BMC (fuck you BMC for charging me so much anyways), and my rainy day fund saved my ass from money vultures calling on behalf of BMC for money that I owed them.
2. Keep track of how much you spend. Set up a basic google spreadsheets folder, and make sure you put all your purchases (and paychecks) into it. There's wi-fi everywhere, so if you by some ungodly chance don't have data, you can update your charges anywhere. This does take some dedication, but you'll never look back and wonder how the fuck you have no money. Plus, it also keeps you accountable.
3. Set up a sheet for paychecks, another for charges (like monthly credit charges, or must expenses, like weekly food runs, etc.), one more for surprise expenses (like a snack run or UberEats run (it happens)), and another for breaking down your paycheck. If there's enough interest, I'll post photos of my own budgeting, or fuck it, if not.
4. Keep a spare hundred in your wallet for hostage situations.

&amp;#x200B;

**Finally, housing:**

Let's face it - BU housing sucks balls, and Daddy Brown makes sure everyone swallows at least once. 

1. Once (and *if)* you can, move off campus. Not only will you be able to smoke weed and drink without fear of fucking snitch RAs, you can also lower housing costs ridiculous amounts. Because when you break it down, even a double in Warren costs $16,160 for housing + dining hall plan (14 meals/week basic plan) for around 8 months (summer = 3 months, and no one is here for winter break = 4 weeks, so 4 months overall you're not at BU), so $16,160 divided by 8 months = $2,020 per month. **Fuck**. **That.** You can get a super renovated and beautiful apartment with one other roommate with your own bedroom and bathroom for that much.
   1. And before you say: but food! And utilities! Let's say you pay 1,200 a month for your own room in Fenway, or Brookline, or Allston, or whatever. Break down costs like so: utilities cost you $40 a month, and then you spend another $50 in food a week. That's $1,200 + $40 + $200 = $1,440 a month. Still almost $600 left. And you get the apartment for a year lease, and heat and hot water are usually included. If not, your apartment sucks.
2. Get furniture second-hand. You're a student, not a family with a new one on the way, and you don't need new couches or tables. BU Free &amp; For Sale and FB Marketplace are best for second-hand furniture at low prices. Negotiate and you can get a full sized bed for $100 (frame and mattress). This will also ensure that you don't over-spend on furniture  you'll need to move out at the end of August anyways.
3. Know your housing and tenant rights. Got rats? Withhold rent. Fridge broken? Withhold rent, AND document your food losses. Make your landlord pay you back for the food you've lost (a.k.a. $$$). Make sure you know what the hell you're getting into, and don't let the landlord bully you into living in sub-par bullshit. And if he fucks with you, fuck him back without lube. 
4. Lastly, make sure you are safe and are in a **legal** lease. Crummy landlords and brokers will try to fuck you over just to make a quick buck, but always ask to take a look at apartments, if the landlord responds quickly to appliance requests (broken sink, toilet, etc.), and if the lease doesn't try to fuck you over. I've had friends try to sublet their apartment for the summer, and then get fucked if their lease says no subletting. Also - look to see which utilities are included, and get someone to take a second glance. **Never, ever let a broker push you into prematurely signing.** If you're uncomfortable with the broker's pushiness, always let them know that you have options and that they're not the only company in Boston. Take a week, breathe, and see some other places.

&amp;#x200B;

Those are the tips just off my head. I'm sick and tired of seeing BU fuck over friends and fellow students over how expensive college and the city itself is. Learn from my mistakes, budget your way through college, and get out debt-free (or as much as possible). I'll be graduating next year with no loans, no debt, and a rainy day fund accumulated from college work. Hopefully, more people will too.

&amp;#x200B;

Peace out."

**Troubleshooting**


- Having difficulty logging into the student link? Make sure you're logging in with your BU Email and not your web account. Your BU Email ends with @bu.edu. If that's not the issue, try logging in with a private window (like an incognito window in chrome or a private window in safari). If you're able to log in, it's likely a cache issue. If you [clear your cache](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/32050?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en), the issue should resolve itself.
- When connecting to BU's wifi, make sure you connect to BU (802.1x) and when you're prompted to put in your username and password, put in your username WITHOUT the @bu.edu. Also, about 90% of the time if your internet isn't connecting, [forgetting the network and reconnecting](https://itss.d.umn.edu/services/network-wireless/wireless-access/forget-wireless-network) will resolve the issue.
- If you change your password, log in with the new password on all of your devices as soon as you can. This will prevent some issues from popping up down the line.
- If you have a Hardware issue (Cracked screen, broken charging port, etc), bring it to our main location at 179 Amory Street. Our satellite locations (like Mugar and Questrom) are not equipped to make hardware repairs.

And always feel free to stop by one of [the BU IT Help Center's locations](https://www.bu.edu/tech/about/help-center/hours/) if you have any questions! We're always happy to help. Here's to a good start to the semester everyone!"
cq4txg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonU/comments/cq4txg/whats_with_the_dining_hall_gestapo/,What's With the Dining Hall Gestapo?,52,24,2019-08-13 21:41:26,"So there I was, on my first week of research work this summer (I'm a grad student), and to my surprise the dining halls were flooded with newcomers (it took me a few moments to realize these were Orientation groups). Once I had finished a hearty, caloric breakfast, I cheerfully took to weaving through the crowd with my tray, chipper and comfortable as always on a fine Thursday morning, the waste-disposal conveyor belts only a few meters away when I was forced to a jarring stop by a group of four officious-looking, evidently well-fed students in golf chairs, arms crossed and unoccupied, apparently standing guard, intensely surveilling the ingress and egress of the waste reception area. I stood there, utterly mystified to find myself suddenly beset with ten seconds of aggressive eye contact from these four undoubtedly noble individuals. Not entirely sure what they were expecting, I let out a nervous ""why hello there"" and simply sidestepped them and approached the conveyor belt with my tray. Just as I was about to set it down, however, a sudden, absurdly loud *sniff* and low growl came from behind me, prompting me to turn around and realize what was happening. Let me pause and just say I have never felt so stared at, so visually molested, so quietly and completely resented in my life.

A rather plump woman, grandly encompassing the largest chair positioned in the middle of the four, the only one of the four making use of her arm rests as opposed to leaving them crossed, clearly the leader, let the silence linger for a few moments until she knew she had my attention. Then, still saying nothing, and violently glaring  into the windows of my soul, she simply gestured with a lazy raise of a hand toward the floor, her head following and swiftly returning to face me in one practiced motion. I then looked down to the area she indicated and found four plastic, rectangular bins, stacked disgustingly high with food matter and liquid waste, gushing over with dribbles of condiments and juices, smearing the floor surrounding them, running viscous with what I can only describe as the most convincing imitation of vomit I have ever seen. I turned my gaping face back to the Food Queen in petrified recognition and she simply nodded. 

With some trepidation, I reaffirmed my grip over my tray and approached the first of these repulsive receptacles. ""What am I supposed to do? Shovel my eggs and ketchup onto this mountain of sewage?"" I asked, but I already had my answer. Another *sniff.* I did as implied, and simply scraped the remains of my breakfast off my tray. They fell with a disgusting *plop* to the bin's surface five feet below, vestiges of egg splattering around the walls and pooling underneath. Just then, thanks to a groaning shift in the topography of food matter, a thick cloud of nauseating putrefaction was released from the intestines of the receptacle and assaulted my nostrils. I have never gagged so hard in my life--raising the question of whether some of that really was vomit I saw before me, from someone with a less resilient stomach earlier this morning, perhaps. 

""Thank you for your concern for our collective hygiene and sanitation. Why, I should say we would be drowning in sewage if it weren't for you and your impassioned environmental concerns,"" I said with exploding irritation, and walked away. 

Who are these self-appointed representatives of the ecosystem of the Boston waterfront, and what is this stunt they think they're pulling? Do they not realize their efforts have a statistically nonexistent effect on the ecological quality of anything whatsoever--in other words, that literally *anything* else they did with their time would be more productive? For example, what's stopping them from marching outside and picking up litter on the freeway?

More importantly, why do they need *four henchmen* to a waste receiver, and why chairs? Is this some kind of bitchy intimidation tactic? If they really wanted to help, and have nothing truly better to do with their time than move the environmental needle imperceptibly toward ""cleaner"" with a day's labors, why don't they volunteer to take their services to the *other* side of the conveyor belt, don a hairnet and white smock, and do the fucking sorting themselves? It would involve an equivalent commitment of time, without inflicting their spiteful company on the rest of us. Oh, but who am I kidding, it just wouldn't quite be the same, would it? After all, in that case they would be starved of that little feeling of importance, those small dopamine hits, they must get when a confused student stares back at them with bovine incomprehension, with less opportunities to furiously eye-fuck passerby and soak in the satisfaction of artificial power. 

Do these unwashed ham beasts have a life? Where are they employed? Do they just exist, extract, and excrete? When they return home on holiday, do they eye-rape their relatives into environmental consciousness there too? I would love to grapple with one of these worthless holes in the air and send *them* down the fucking conveyor belt--or better yet, into the appropriate receptacle, ""Green for Recyclable, Blue for Actual Shit!""."
cu7fpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonU/comments/cu7fpg/some_collected_advicetipsanswered_questions_from/,Some collected advice/tips/answered questions from a recent CS alum,47,18,2019-08-22 19:12:09,"I recently decided I was going to switch the account I use to comment on this subreddit. In the process, I've gone and deleted everything I'd written about BU on my old account. But it seemed a shame to have all that stuff -- questions answered, tips given, etc. lost forever. With the semester starting up soon and freshmen descending on campus, I figured it'd be a good time to collect the useful bits (lightly edited) into one mega post here.

It's mostly CS major related stuff, but I've tried to separate out the universally applicable parts at the top. It is a lot. I've tried to update minor things in italics if they have since changed. If you have any additional questions I might be able to answer (especially about the CS major), I'm happy to answer in comments or via PM/chat.

----

**Universally applicable**

&gt; How easy is it to find tutors/how helpful is the career office?

It varies a lot per department/major. I was CS, and I was presented with ample opportunities to network and get an internship via career days, professor networks, etc -- and all those resources were through the CS department or clubs. I never once used the official career office.

In all likelihood, my experience is unique to the CS major. A business student would likely have a very different set of resources; likewise with COM or CFA, or even different majors in CAS.

You shouldn't be afraid to ask specifics about your own major -- people with relevant experience will probably chime in.

&gt; How does the meal plan loophole work?

Also referred to as the 330 -&gt; 250 ""hack"". For newcomers or those out of the loop, here's some info:

The 330 and 250 plans both have a fixed number of meals and dining points. Both cost the same, but the 330 has fewer dining points than the 250 (which makes sense, since you have more dining hall swipes).

There is an undocumented (but very popular among those who know about it) loophole you can use to effectively ""convert"" some of the meals on your dining plan into extra dining points. It's perfectly legal -- you aren't ""exploiting the system"" or anything, at least to my knowledge -- you're just getting your value in a different way (some of your meals are being converted into their dining point-equivalent value). People like this because dining points can be used at more places around campus like the GSU (food court with places like Panda Express), Late Night, and the West Campus market.

Here's the way it works (it's pretty simple):

- Start the year (in the fall) signed up for the 330 plan, and use it as normal. DO NOT switch plans at any point during the fall semester.
- Once the spring semester starts, go on Student Link and switch from the 330 to the 250 plan. 

Once done, you'll find that, with no extra charge, you'll end up with an _absurd_ amount of dining points -- usually over 1000 to spend through the spring semester. (For comparison, the largest amount you can get on a standard plan is something like 800, and that's spread out over the whole year.) It's usually enough that you don't ever have to visit the dining halls at all during the spring semester if you don't want to. (Though you will still have 125 swipes for that semester regardless of whether you choose to use them or not.)

There are a few things to keep in mind with this:

- Any dining points you don't end up using at the end of the semester will be refunded back to you as Convenience Points at 50 cents on the dollar. This means it's in your best interest to use as many of them as possible: if you have 300 points left over, you'll only get 150 back -- a loss of 150 dollars. But, if you only have 50 left over, you'll get 25 back -- a loss of only 25 in comparison.
- If you're an incoming freshman, I'm not sure how strongly I'd recommend doing this. Some of my best memories from freshman year were made with friends in the dining halls, and you shouldn't shy away from eating with friends just because you feel like you have to use your dining points. BUT, it's always good to have additional options, and you're still able to use the dining hall anyway. It's just probably a good thing to keep in mind.

----

If anyone is, for some reason, curious how this works in terms of actual numbers, here's how I understand it:

Meals on the 330 and 250 plans are split halfway between semesters. For example, if you're on the 250 plan, you have an allowance of 125 meals for the fall and 125 for the spring. If you're on the 330 plan, you have 165 meals per semester.

When you switch from 330 to 250, the per-semester allowance needs to go down from whatever you currently have to 125 (for the 250 plan). That means 40 meals (the difference between 165 and 125), plus whatever meals you didn't use from the last semester's allowance of 165, automatically get converted to dining points at a rate of $10 (possibly more, can't remember exactly) per meal. This means, in addition to the larger amount of dining points you get from switching to 250, you also get at least 400 more dining points on top of it. Usually, this yields at least 1000, though I've seen far higher than that.

**Computer Science specific**

&gt; What's the first CS class I should take?

CS111. It's a great introduction to programming in Python (a good beginner language) and computer science overall; it tries to cover the basics of a lot of different sub-topics like low-level programming, logic, and algorithms. It counts for both the major and minor and is usually the first thing people take. If you're considering a major, it's a great jumping off point--highly recommended and a lot of fun. Plus Sullivan is one of the best professors at BU (but you'll hear me say that about a lot of CS professors 🙂)

&gt; How hard is CS112 compared to CS111?

_(Author's note: This is a significantly older reply -- about 4 years old -- and I'm not sure I agree with myself anymore. CS112 is not unreasonably difficult, but it is a step up from 111. I think that's what I was trying to convey. Additionally -- I took 112 with Wayne Snyder; different people teach it nowadays, and the curriculum will probably be different. Take this with a grain of salt.)_

112 is significantly more difficult, especially later in the semester. You'll start out learning the basics of Java and diving deeper into object-oriented programming. (The OOP you learned in 111 is really only scratching the surface; Python wasn't really designed to be object-oriented, and Java is far more robust in that area.) Later you'll get into data structures like linked lists and hash tables; towards the end of the semester, you'll be doing some really cool projects like an article search engine.

It's really the first class that's representative of the true difficulty of later CS classes--111 is a joke compared to later stuff in the major. If you manage 112 okay, you'll be fine for the rest of the major. In that sense, you could call it a weed-out class, but it's not really the same as like Chem 101. It's a perfectly fair class that not everybody can manage.

&gt; Who is the best CS professor you've had at BU?

- Andrei Lapets -- anything he teaches
- Sharon Goldberg -- NetSec
- Mayank Varia -- Applied Crypto
- Leonid Reyzin -- Intro to Crypto
- John Byers -- Algorithms

&gt; How much programming will I learn? Will I need to do independent learning to ensure I'm up to speed?

CS111/112/210 are the only CS classes where learning programming is the explicit focus of the class, but that doesn't mean that you don't program in other classes--quite the opposite, in fact. With the exception of the really theory-oriented classes like 131 and 330, you can expect to be programming all the time as part of your work. It's just that you're working in the context of applying some theory or algorithm instead of just programming for the sake of learning how to program. You might build something that applies RSA encryption to a message for CS235, or an M/M/1 queuing simulator for CS350, or a simplified machine language compiler in CS320 (all actual examples from those classes). All of those are very substantive programming projects. You certainly don't need to worry about forgetting how to code, that's for sure.

Regarding independent learning: to learn specific platforms like Android or web, you will largely need to take that on yourself. BUCS assumes that you're intelligent enough to figure out ""specifics"" on your own and instead focuses on teaching you the more abstract theoretical bits that (in my opinion) are much harder to learn outside of an academic environment. Understanding theory allows you to learn things quicker, which is (to me) far, far more valuable than studying some web framework that's going to be irrelevant in six months anyway. With that said, however, we do have a few very practical-skill-oriented classes: CS411 (the software engineering class) is probably the best way to learn web development as part of a class. We have a CS591 that's been going for two semesters now about Android app development. _(Author's note: this 591 may have since changed to a permanent numbered class. It's been going on for years at this point.)_

You should also look into the CS-oriented clubs. [Global App Initiative](http://www.globalappinitiative.org/#global-app-initiative) and [Open Web](http://openwebbu.org/) are focused on doing things with mobile and web, respectively, and [BUILDS](http://builds.cc/)/Women in CS/[Make BU](http://make.bu.edu/) do workshops for this kind of stuff all the time. BUILDS and Make BU are great environments for working on a personal project -- BUILDS has a makerspace that's open 24/7, and Make BU hosts weekly hack nights. 

Finally--consider getting involved with the hackathon scene. They're a great way to really get your feet wet with something new, plus you'll have something to show off at the end of it. Make BU organizes trips to the big ones around the Boston area _(author's note: at least they did in the past... not sure about now)_, and there are always at least a few smaller hackathons at BU throughout the year (BUILDS/BostonHacks usually hosts Local Hack Day, for example). 

&gt; Which programming languages are taught at BU?

We don't end up doing a lot of specific language learning in BUCS; I've heard professors say the goal is to provide you the tools and mindset to be able to pick up a language in a few weeks, max. 

With that said, the (rough) language breakdown for the CS curriculum at BU is as follows:

- CS 111: Python (used to be Java)
- 112: Java
- 210: C and Assembly

- 131: none (usually--it's the proofs class, so there's basically no programming, although Lapets gave Python assignments when he taught it)

- 132: varies depending on professor, but Python is most common (since it's great for data analysis and math)
- 235: likewise
- 237: likewise

- 320: since this is a programming languages course, you'll get exposure to a wide array of languages, but it varies depending on professor. Lapets taught in Python and Haskell, while Xi (who will probably be teaching it from here on out) teaches in ATS, the language he defined as part of his work.
- 330: depends on professor; Byers specified ""any high-level language"" which I suppose could mean C++ in theory, but I don't know why you'd want to. (And 330 is Algorithms anyway; programming isn't really the main focus, nor should it be.)
- 350: Java

That's more or less all the required curriculum classes. The upper-level courses (400+) vary a bit more, especially the 591s as those are project courses.

&gt; How easy is it to get recruited or to get an internship?

That's mostly on you and the effort you put into the job hunt. BUCS won't spoonfeed you an internship, but there are ample opportunities to connect with companies through the department (for example, we have our own CS-specific career day), Spark/Hariri Institute, and things like clubs/hackathons. If you take advantage of them, you will find something.

In terms of specific companies? I know a number of people that have gone to the Big Four (Facebook, Google/YouTube, Microsoft, Amazon); Facebook and Google have showed up to CS Day two years running, though I'd say actually getting an offer at one of these is no guarantee. You definitely need to be a very good student and interview well.

Red Hat has a significant presence on campus (they're collaborating with the Hariri Institute on a number of things, and they have an Engineer in Residence at Spark) and they hire quite a lot of BUCS students.

Yelp and Bloomberg do recruiting events with BUILDS every year, and others will usually do similar things (I think MakeBU does stuff with GitHub and Microsoft too, and I think Women in CS does office tours of some Cambridge tech companies like Google)

Both of BU's major hackathons (BostonHacks and TechTogether) will have a _huge_ amount of engineers from many different companies on-site -- great opportunity to connect, you should go to BostonHacks for sure and TechTogether if you're female/femme non-binary

Otherwise, you'll see a lot of one-offs. LinkedIn, Fidelity, VMware, Wayfair, Twitter, Uber, others I'm forgetting -- people go all over. Some go to startups, some try to start their own startups (sometimes with the help of Spark). It runs the gamut.

Though, like I said, it's all on you and what you put into the job hunt. You won't go anywhere without effort on your part.

&gt; What is the general vibe in CS?

I think that depends a lot on which ""part"" you end up getting involved with. The department is _enormous_ now, with somewhere around 800 undergrads -- which means a lot of diversity in terms of attitude, personality, etc. Some people will just show up to class and live the rest of their life outside the department. Others will end up being super involved with the department and extracurriculars -- attending six different CS-related clubs, going to hackathons, TFing a class, etc. A lot end up somewhere in the middle of those two extremes.

Either approach can probably be fine, though personally (as someone who was much closer to the latter) I think it'd be a tremendous waste to attend BUCS and _not_ get involved with the extracurriculars. They really are fantastic here, and the people you'll meet will shape your experience for the better. They were very personable, eager to help, supportive, and generally great people. I think that sentiment kind of extends to the CS department as a whole -- professors were kind, and genuinely made you feel like they cared about your individual success. (I really enjoyed my time here.)

I've also heard polar opposite experiences from mine -- they hated the professors, didn't like the students, didn't feel their experience was worth it, etc. _Somehow,_ I get the feeling those opinions come from people that just showed up to class and didn't do much else. Most of the people I knew that attended clubs/other things had a great time here.

&gt; Regarding the Math/CS joint major:
1. Would it be better to major in just one of these subject areas because a joint major might not go as in depth into either field?

2. Would I be able to get a job in computer science with this degree or would I need an actual degree in CS?

3. How demanding is this program?

For 2 (and sort of 1): you'll absolutely be qualified for a job on CS; perhaps more so than pure CS majors, depending on the subfield (quantitative finance, for example, loves joint majors). Even then, you shouldn't be getting a lesser education than most CS majors; you should still have some free rein to take the electives you want in the CS major. If I recall correctly, most of the difference with the joint major (from the CS side) comes down to the mid-level math/theoretical background. You'll take those classes with the Math department instead of CS; all other CS courses remain unchanged. (If I'm mistaken, someone please correct me).

For 3: can't speak for the rigor of the joint major, but I can say that CS is usually challenging but rewarding. It's certainly no cakewalk, and you'll be busy, but the work tends to be interesting (even fun) and the community/your classmates will make things even better. I would imagine the addition of math would make things a bit more difficult, and I can't say I know the workload of those classes, but if you're up for it, it's certainly a great program.

**Random stuff that didn't really fit anywhere else, mostly CS related**

- Certain CS classes may be taught by different professors between semesters, and usually there is a distinct difference in the quality of the class depending on the professor--you may want to postpone or accelerate your schedule based on that. A good example is CS330: one of the most important classes you're going to take as a CS major (you learn everything companies will ask you in an interview in CS330). If you can, you should take it with Byers; he's by far the best person to learn algorithms from compared to others that teach it. (This isn't to say that others are bad; just that Byers is _so much better_.)

- It's not entirely necessary to take all the Group B math courses; IMO, you should do at least 132 and 237. That said, if you know you're interested in doing crypto or security, it may be worthwhile to do 235. Then again, I took both 235 and 538, and I felt like if I had gone into 538 without doing 235 I could have made it work. Depends on what kind of student you are though. I say make your decision based on who teaches 235.

- I consider 558 a must-take class. Sharon Goldberg is awesome.

- Try and sign up for the CS591s at some point in your time at BU, and don't be afraid to take them early. They aren't necessarily insanely difficult classes.

I'm serious, JWs, a couple Asian ""healing-focused"" groups, and other movements are examples--I saw one today at the GSU. Another one I've seen in Brookline is a group handing out flyers for boston-meditation.org, which upon research is a Scientology-like group. 

Undergrads, particularly freshman, are good targets for these recruiters because oftentimes they are a) too polite to say no, b) unconnected and looking for a sense of belonging, and c) generally too unaware to know better. Don't be afraid to straight up walk away from a conversation if you get roped in to one. Don't take flyers. Generally I don't even make eye contact.

I've linked [a list of active cults](https://www.watchman.org/index-of-cults-and-religions/) here. [CultWatch](https://www.cultwatch.com/) is another good resource.

* Don't walk or stand in the paths. There's a perfectly good sidewalk right there. You don't want bikers on the sidewalk, do you? Show them the same courtesy.

* Look both ways before stepping into the path. Bike traffic *mostly* goes the same way as road traffic, but if someone is starting or ending their trip on this block they may be going the opposite way.

* Pay extra attention at the bottom of the Comm Ave hill, especially around the bus stops. Bikers can pick up a lot of speed approaching this spot, which they'll want to use to get them up the next hill.

* If you hear a bell behind you, the *worst* thing you can do is suddenly lurch to the side. Maintain your speed and direction, look over your shoulder, then determine if you're in the way or if the biker was telling you to maintain course. (Bikers: Start ringing your bell a few seconds before you come to the person you're passing, so they have time to react and track you)"

-Walk on the right side of the sidewalk. 

-Queue jumping is awful, if you aren't sure where the queue ends ask someone. If it's a situation where you need to wait for something, you wait in a queue not a mob. 

-Tipping is a thing here. My rules for tipping are as follows:

Sit-down restaurant service gets 20% of the bill unless the server was outright rude. Counter service places like pavement don't need tips, but if you order something that requires skill to make (espresso drinks are a good example) then I usually tip a dollar or so. If you order like seven things at a counter service restaurant it's common and customary to tip a few bucks. 

-Weather changes super quickly in Boston so its a good idea to dress in layers and plan for the worst case scenario. For example I have a compact umbrella that goes everywhere with me. 

-There are a lot of places on campus that try to scam students that don't know any better, especially international students who may not know common prices or practices. Off the top of my head avoid the flower shop on Comm and go to Economy Hardware in south instead. In general, I've listed a couple of common items and reasonable prices below. 


-If you are interacting with a professor, TA, or TF, it's common here to treat them essentially as a peer. There's no need to be excessively formal and don't be afraid to attend their office hours. That said, always remember to thank them for their time. 

Feel free to sound off with more tips in the comments 



Common prices:

-Haircut (mens) $20
-Haircut (womens) $30-60 depending on what you want done
-Hot coffee $2-3
-Weed $7-10/gram"

It’s on the first floor, behind the stacks across from the circulation desk. 

The university has a copy of all textbooks you should ever need, and on the off chance they don’t there’s probably someone in your class that’s willing to help you out. 

Once a month, I grab all the textbooks I need to read and make pdfs of the specific sections I’m assigned on the syllabus. I generally have too much reading to do it all at once, but you could certainly try. 

I do this for two reasons: one, fuck the textbook industry, full stop, and two, it holds me accountable for reading my texts. If you spend a half hour making sure you have access to something you’re gonna want to use it, just so you didn’t waste that half hour. 

The scan and copy center is fully staffed if you need help with the scanner, but otherwise they shouldn’t bother you.

I'm a staff member at the Center for Career Development, but I wanted to share it with you guys on Reddit. A couple reasons:

1. This is the biggest fair we've ever had. We've confirmed with 118 employers from all over the country, who are coming to fill internships and open job positions. Some of the biggest names; Dell, Wayfair, Staples, Oracle, AstraZeneca, Converse. Tons more, including nonprofits and mission-driven organizations.
2. We have our highest-ever number of employers who are accepting CPT/OPT and willing to sponsor international students. If you're an international student, absolutely don't miss this one.
3. There will be a photobooth where you can get a completely free LinkedIn headshot.

If you do come to the Career Fair, we suggest you wear business casual ([Youtube video on what that means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tyin13D2eKk)), and bring multiple copies of your resume. You can use the [resume improvement app VMock](https://www.vmock.com/bu) if you're stuck getting it ready. We also have a [bunch of blog posts](https://bu-beyond.blog/?s=career+fair) about working the fair, how to handle a career fair if you're an introvert, etc.

No matter how hard I try to enjoy being here, I can never seem to be happy. There’s just so many problems. 

1. No school spirit. I literally walk in the dining hall, and I see people wearing HARVARD sweatshirts, UMichigan shirts, etc. I came here for a diverse/large student body, but there doesn’t seem to be any unity here. It’s so hard to connect with people, especially if you don’t fit into a particular clique. There’s diversity, but because of the lack of school spirit, none of us are bound together. All the artistic CFA kids do hang in their circle. The Questrom kids are in their bubble. Most of the African American students only hang in the HTC in their circle. And the international students are mostly decked out in Gucci, and don’t ever try to meet people outside of their own ethnicity / class. Literally the one “school spirit” we have is a BU meme page on Facebook that talks about how shitty and depressing our school is. ALSO, we literally need signs in the Baystate Dining Hall letting people know that they can share the tables. Students are so bad at socializing that they have to resort to put up signs reminding kids to talk to one another. 

2. Literally nothing to do. I’m not the one to always go out and party, but damn. If you aren’t in a frat, it’s literally impossible to get into anything. For a guy who doesn’t wanna commit to being in a fraternity, but wants to party on occasion, it’s nearly impossible. No one is welcoming. And outside of parties, what else is there to do? The Fitrec closes so early, andit’s cold af outside to do anything. I’m from Cali, and I’m shocked at the lack of actual activities to do in Boston. I don’t have the money to always eat out. Other than eating out, what is there to do in Boston? 

3) Our president is LITERALLY one of the HIGHEST paid college presidents in the country. Where is our money going? It’s so frustrating having to live in these cramped ass, old-style dorms and pay 70K when Northeastern is right down the block with an actual campus and decent dorms. When will they actually renovate the dorms here? Everything is so musty and old. How do they expect students to be happy while handling an unhealthy workload when the living conditions are nowhere near other schools? 

4) The BU bus is never on time. I always have to walk to class or the gym because I can never rely on this bus to transport me anywhere on time. Could this school at least do something right and get me to my class at the right time? Literally having to walk down our so called “campus” which is literally street when it’s going to be cold af is so inconvenient and burdensome. 

I could go on forever. I know some people are just gonna tell me to transfer (which I’m trying to) and that this place isn’t for everyone, but I think it’s so fucked up how this school receives so many students during summer visits, making it out to be a happy place when students are usually so depressed to even talk to each other."

I just want someone to point me in the direction of a resource where I can get this type of person held accountable.

However, I learned today that apparently you cannot take classes in the same department that satisfy different area for divisional credits. So only AR100 or 101 will count as a gen ed and the other will not. I emailed my advisor last semester about this and he told me not to worry and that he would figure it out. He never followed up with me after that so I assumed it was fine. Just this week I emailed him about something else and he jus told me what I wrote above.

So my question is: has this ever happened to anyone else and is there any chance I can get an exception for this? I thought my schedule was set and set up work around that, so changing and adding a class is my last resort.

Thanks.

For clarification: I emailed my advisor last semester about my degree advice report not stating that I was finished with my gen eds since I thought there was an error and didn’t know about this policy yet. He said he would figure out how to get it to work and not to worry."

I hope it clears things out,91,7,2020-04-14 14:25:25,"Boston University is giving careful thought and consideration to providing you with the great academic experience you expect from BU along with the extra safety and security required during these difficult times of the COVID-19 pandemic. All of us are uncertain as to the course of the virus and how we will resume more normal activities. This is true for institutions as well, and at BU we are following the best practice of planning for all contingencies. BU values transparency above all else and is developing a COVID-19 Recovery plan which has been featured in BU Today and local media.

I am writing today because there has been some misrepresentation about BU's plans for the fall term. It appears that some news outlets interpreted the article to indicate that BU did not expect to return to residential in-person operations until spring 2021. Our intent is just the opposite:

Our recovery planning is focused on the fall semester, and the resumption of our on-campus, in-person programs in late August. We are planning accordingly and will incorporate the best public health practices into those plans so that members of the BU community will feel comfortable and safe on campus upon their return for fall semester. If for some reason public health authorities do not allow universities to re-open their residential campuses at that time, our planning will explore other alternatives, including the possibility of restarting in-person classes later in the year while continuing with remote classes until then.

We are very excited to welcome you to the BU Class of 2024. I wish you all the best as you complete your studies this spring and we promise to update you about the ways Boston University is planning to make your first year at BU academically challenging, safe, and full of opportunity."

BU is developing scenarios and budgets for a range of options, from opening the residential campus in August, to delaying it until January 2021, Brown said.

Brown said he anticipates that the research enterprise and labs at BU will be the first to restart on campus, since they involve smaller groups, and social distancing is less of a problem. The university will also be able to test its safety procedures on this group to make sure they can be applied to larger groups of students and employees returning, Brown said.

But even if universities bring undergraduates back to campus, the experience may be entirely different from what students are familiar with, Brown said.

Students may be able to live in some dorms, but they may have to take lecture classes online, he said.

“It will not be business as usual,” Brown said.

""College students are not eligible for the $1,200 checks that more than 100 million Americans are slated to receive. But students have another way to collect federal relief funds. A provision in the $2.2 trillion coronavirus aid package, passed last month, earmarked $12.5 billion that the federal government is sending to [more than 5,000 colleges](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/allocationsforsection18004a1ofcaresact.pdf). The law requires each school to pay at least half of the money it receives directly to students in the form of “emergency financial aid grants.”

With BU getting $14,995,316 ($7,497,658 Minimum Allocation to be Awarded for Emergency Financial Aid Grants to Students), BU is on the lower end per student (about $225-250 roughly), that is if everyone gets this aid, rather than those who NEED it."

Brown and the Provost also mention that this plan is not the main focus. 

It is great that our school is keeping us informed about future plans. Students need to stop speculating, **be patient**, and wait for an official statement from **our** president, and not some random news station, of what is going to occur. 

No one knows what is going to happen with the virus in the next few months. We must understand that whatever decision is made for us, it is for **our safety**.

DIRECT QUOTE:

""Students at the University of Chicago are threatening to withhold their spring quarter tuition unless the university agrees to negotiate with them on tuition rates and offer students a look at the university’s budget.

The group, UChicago for Fair Tuition, is demanding a 50% reduction in tuition and the elimination of student fees for as long as the coronavirus pandemic continues, the group said in a statement Friday.

“As everyone knows, unemployment is reaching record levels and that is clearly affecting students and their families,” Julia Attie, an organizer of the campaign, said Friday.

The group said that as of Friday morning, more than 1,100 students had signed a petition calling on the university to negotiate with the group and more than 650 students are considering withholding their spring tuition money, due April 29, if negotiations fail.

“The University recognizes the difficult and unforeseen challenges that COVID-19 has brought about for many of our students and their families,” university spokesman Gerald McSwiggan said in an emailed statement."""
g9awo6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonU/comments/g9awo6/psa_antichegg_investigation_tactics/,PSA: Anti-Chegg Investigation tactics,9,100,2020-04-27 15:24:46,"Just wanted to post a couple tips to throw off any future chegg investiagtions. We have to disincentivize investigations like this as much as possible. To all the chem and physics students, that means stop coming clean, stop ratting on people. The faculty and staff need to feel like they're wasting their time slogging through anonymous IPs and trying to grab at smoke. Don't give them the results they're looking for.

Tips:

1) If you are on BU campus, use BU Guest or another wifi network, or cellphone data to access solutions. If you're signed into BU wifi and accessing chegg, it isn't too hard to put the pieces together.

2) Use PREPAID debit cards to buy a chegg subscription. This way they cannot track you by your card information.

3) Don't put your name in the email you use. Obviously.

4) Never copy solutions exactly. It's actually best to read through the answer and follow the chegg tutor's work so you understand how they're solving it. Then rewrite the problem in a different way.

5) Double check the answers. Based on my experience using chegg, I'd estimate 30-40% of the time they get stuff wrong or leave stuff out.

6) One thing I did to throw off professors is write the questions out by hand and post them. The algorithm is bad at translating written questions into text, as opposed to pictures of typed questions. When faculty search for their question in the search bar, they will have a hard time finding your post. Of course in a timed exam this might be difficult.

7) Even if you're planning to use chegg, it's worth your while to have at least a basic understanding of the material, enough to pass a fair exam (AKA Not 6 hard questions with 7-8 parts in 1 hr 40 min). This way you can check whether chegg answers make sense. So definitely study."

Students may not have much power in changing things directly, but leaving **honest and respectful** feedback on a public platform, whether praise or criticism, can help shift the discourse. I'm pretty sure the majority of the students read feedback RateMyProfessor before making a decision on certain classes and professors during registration. Informing everyone of students were treated, especially during these circumstances, will reflect in that professor's future enrollment numbers and reputation.


Remember, this isn't a time to bash a professor if you got caught cheating. *That's your own fault.* But if you would like to point out to future students how they conducted classes, exams, etc. in light of recent events, this is the perfect opportunity to do so.

While I agree with this, as someone who is going to live off campus this year, be careful because when you go to classes you can still easily spread the virus. If you are attending your classes in person, being irresponsible off campus is still going to affect others (in your dorm too)

I for one, am scared that my roommates are going to be bringing their SO’s over, and we cannot control what they do. 

Furthermore, you can easily endanger those who are the roommates of whoever you’re living with, EVEN IF they comply with your request to bring friends/your SO over. People sometimes feel embarrassed or don’t want to be mean, and would even risk their own health to just not say “no” to you due to fear of causing friction in the household. Be considerate that even if your mate is okay with you coming over, their roommate who’s “chill” may actually not be and it’s best to make visits rare. 

Just be responsible and try to not have people over regularly, don’t go visit your off campus friends regularly, suck it up for a semester. It’s literally just a semester. I was in an LDR for 3 years from the US to Australia so please guys it’s not that hard. I went home and was under government order to quarantine at home for 2 months and I’m alive.

The answer thus far seems to be a lot being enforced very strictly (this is a good thing.) However, not being able to invite people into your dorm and getting removed from campus if you do will make sex very difficult. It may be crass to bring up given the dire circumstances, but lets be real: campus wide abstinence is \*not\* going to happen. It's pure fantasy. On average, I think it's fair to say that college campuses make up what are perhaps the horniest areas of civilization, something that will only be amplified by recent events. Because of this, as uncomfortable as it may be, BU needs to address how students can be intimate while generally (obviously not as strictly) adhering to social distancing guidelines. Do I have an answer? God no, but there needs to be one. Not providing any way for students to have safe sex will only create situations where students have unsafe sex, so it is important for the general safety of campus that, well, we're given some guidelines as to how we can fuck."

I respect everyones opinions about the situation regarding fall semester.

My only issue is the people who are so anti-going back or are constantly making it feel like we're delusional or whatever are not understanding how PRIVILEGED you are to be able to have the choice to stay home or to go back and both options be totally safe and valid and would make the semester successful for you. 

So many people are in bad relationships and bad lives at home, people dont have a guaranteed housing for much longer, people dont have adequate resources at home to conduct remote learning (shitty wifi, access to supplies &amp; stuff etc.) or people might be in states where theyre at higher risk. so being back in boston would ACTUALLY benefit them more than staying home for more reasons than the covid.

Continue the conversation but PLEASE just be mindful and take into account that some people are actually going to be safer in boston and they shouldnt be made to feel stupid bc you never know whats going on for people. 

This situation is very hard and very mentally draining for everyone in different ways. But we need to acknowledge the privileges we have when it comes to this fall semester. Lots of people are going back just bc they miss it and wanna go back. Thats totally valid, but just take into account the fact that that is a PRIVILEGE that LOTS OF PEOPLE do not have.

Personally, I’m an international student CGS ‘23 and was supposed to go to London this summer. I waited all last year (CGS gap semester) to come to campus for my freshman year. 49 days later, I was sent back home because of COVID. My 6 week summer London semester, which I was extremely excited for, turned into 6 weeks of Zoom classes which was still 30K since I pay full tuition. I (my dad who I know works his ass off day and night) paid $70k+ for an online freshman year. It sucks that even for this coming school year, I’ll be paying full tuition. This blows, especially for students who pay full :(

Oh, and for those of you who don’t know, international students are required to pay full tuition in the US unless they are under a scholarship."

While I do get quite a bit of aid via grants and whatnot, that's still not enough for me, so I have to take out private and federal loans to help out. I know it was probably really stupid of me to do this, but it isn't something I had to start doing until sophomore year, and my degree probably isn't worth the debt at all, but here we are...

I just want to ask in here to see if anyone else is in the same boat because every time I think about it, I want to throw up. My dad cosigned and is helping me pay them off, but that just adds to the guilt and makes me want to be able to pay them off ASAP even more...."

None of us are happy that they've once again raised tuition for the year. I know that they have employees and buildings etc to maintain, but it still seems unfair that tuition is going up even though the experience will be completely different, I'll be unable to learn as effectively, you get the gist. Again, I get that they're already losing money as it is, which is why I feel hopeless about it. However, my family, and i'm sure every other family has been affected by covid and it's very difficult to find the money from savings  to pay this next bill. I've worked really hard to pay off loans with my own money and now my parents are saying that I'm ""not allowed"" to take out any more loans and refusing to pay unless BU can do something. My mom even told me I could be transferring schools for my last year. I told them that even getting a tuition freeze would be a miracle from them but they won't hear it. 

Basically, parents want the bill LOWERED. that's it. no loans, no scholarships (i'm applying to some without telling them). Pretty sure it's hopeless as I haven't heard of any school in the northeast considering changing tuition and I really doubt they're going to do anything for me just because my parents said so, lol. Just wanted to see if my fellow terriers thought it was hopeless as well! Also, still going to call them, I just want to know how much disappointment I should be expecting :)"

To preface, my contract is about $500 so it may be different depending how much you have an storage but I thought this might be helpful regardless. 
Extended storage until January (to return for spring semester) : $244.98
Extended storage until October 2021 (this is their year-long option aka if COVID-19 doesn’t die down and you’re not be able to return until next year): $734.93
As of now, UPS has told me that I would be responsible for the costs until January since I do not plan on returning to campus, however when I asked housing about what to do with my stuff, they said they don’t have any information yet so they may be looking to pay for fall semester but knowing BU, I *highly* doubt it.

As an alumnus of Boston University, I thought that the administration would follow the consequences outlined in the Code of Student Responsibilities. As stated in the code, hosting, or attending, a gathering of more than 25 people will result in a suspension through the fall semester for all students involved. Additionally, in an email by Dean Elmore, he states that he will immediately ""take the \[administrative actions listed above\] and follow up via the disciplinary process outlined in the Boston University Code of Student Responsibilities."" However, from this incident, it is abundantly clear that his words are complete and utter horse shit. 

I expected better, though I suppose this follows a trend that the administration has sustained for years on end. For the students at Nickerson Field that violated these guidelines, I wish you good luck. If you all are ready to face suspension before the official start of the school year, then you do not belong at this institution. For Dean Elmore, you stated that ""\[t\]here will be a few students who won’t take COVID-19 seriously\[,\] and their stay in our community will be short-lived."" Well, it looks like you do not take COVID-19 seriously, although your stay at this community is not short-lived.

I will end this post with a quote from Dean Elmore. Although he has proven to be a hypocrite, the words themselves do hold some merit. ""The choices you make will play a critical role in minimizing transmission of COVID-19, within the University community and within our neighboring communities. If you suspend good judgment, you risk exposing yourself and others to the coronavirus and will face disciplinary action."""

iisnn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonU/comments/iisnn2/comparison_statistics_on_bus_covid_dashboard_are/,Comparison statistics on BU’s COVID dashboard are intentionally misleading.,1,9,2020-08-29 06:47:52,"Hello all, just wanted to point out something that is probably understood by most already: the implied comparison of BU testing to MA and local counties is misleading.

Why? Because there is strong-selection bias in who is testing. For BU: we are testing almost everyone, and this repeatedly. Thus, rates of positive are relatively low reflecting that this testing is not targeted towards those more likely to have the disease. 

For MA and surrounding counties, the people being tested are dominantly those who have reason to believe they have contracted COVID. This selection will of course lead to a higher positive rate. In addition, retesting people is fairly rare here unlike at BU.

Testing is incredibly important and it is commendable, conditional on the incorrect decision to reopen, that BU scaled it up this much and is posting the stats in close to real-time. 

That being said, the little table on the BU Covid dashboard comparing BU testing stats to MA and local counties is meaningless and misleading.

Also, there are many girls who live in Allston. Not every girl walking down the street in Allston is a freshman looking for a darty to walk into. I feel like the sexism here has been HIGH and every student who isn't living in a dorm is assumed to be a partying drunk who doesn't care about COVID.

I transferred to BU last year and have lived off campus ever since. I also missed most of the orientation events because I had to go apartment hunting. Anyway, my first semester was great and I actually met quite a lot of people, even though I was a transfer living off campus. However, due to the pandemic, 95 % of my friends have not come back to campus. I go to class in person every day, but I rarely talk to anybody. I don't want to come off as whiny, but I am not dealing with this very well. Back home (I'm international), I have lots of friends and I am always hanging out with people, but here it's quite the opposite. I love meeting new people and I am very sociable. However, I am really struggling and I want to make new friends before my time at BU is over. I feel like I am missing out on one if the most important components of college: social life. For example, I've never been to a party or to TITS haha

Having said that, I am looking for advice on how to meet people. I have plenty of time and an open mind. I know that living off campus during a pandemic is not the best start, but knowing where to look, what to do or even starting a conversation here would be great.

If you made it all the way down, thank you very much and I hope you have a great semester!"

I know from working in it the past 3 years and being close with a lot of people that the original person who had the dining reddit account doesn't work at BU anymore, and the current people don't check. 

If you want to actually do something about the quality of your food, [here is the QR code and URL to the dining survey](https://imgur.com/a/83Ju1DA). My card says Starbucks because I took it at Starbucks duh. But if you follow the link and put in the right info, you are able to write a review over any dining outlet on campus. Yes we read them, management gets an email whenever a survey is filled out, and they are taken seriously. 

If your food quality is a matter of safety, such as receiving undercooked food, contaminated food, allergens when you have a known allergy, etc. you should email the safety director (whose email is on the dining website.) He's very good about these things, but there's no way to find out unless he actually knows these things are happening.  Safety does not necessarily mean quality, as in if there's items missing on your food or if the portions are too small, this is not a safety issue."

The survey someone posted is a great idea, but just wanted to add some more input. So last year I became friends with some of the west dining hall managers and staff because we would just talk about sports and other issues. I know they all look scary but they are all super friendly and easy to talk to. They would always switch the tv channel for me so that I could watch the MLB playoffs and then we would chat about our teams. Anyways the tip is to actually go up to them, introduce yourself, and start a conversation about the food/what you want or any improvements they can make. Of course be respectful and nice. I've had a meal plan for 3 years now so I love the Dhall. If you're shy here's what I started with(sidenote he already knows me from last year) ""I know a lot of people have been unhappy with the food here, but I know the supply chain is messed up and you guys are trying your best."" One of the changes I asked was for cheerios/more cereal options. I love cereal and I noticed they would only have Raisin Brand and fruity cheerios. At the beginning they had cheerios and lately, they stopped so I went up to Marco(Dude with the hat who is always there) and asked him about it. I also told him it would be super helpful if we could have more cereal options in general. I went today and noticed they have so many cereal options now and I even found some cheerios! We had a nice little conversation and at the end he asked me to always come up to him if I had more tips or anything the dining hall could improve. So the next day I went over to him and asked about a permanent rice station. If you remember last year there was a station in the middle with a big self serve rice cooker. This year its gone and now the stations never seem to have rice. What he told me is he is trying to get that done for me and in his words ""Rice is a staple good and it's not hard to screw it up so I get why you would want that."" I've been trying to push this through because sometimes I don't like the food options and I used to always get bowls of white rice to get in my calories. Last thing before I get downvoted is to remember this is their job and we do pay for it so don't be afraid to speak up because it clearly works. Wait until we get that rice cooker y'all will see the effects of me being a karen. Hope all you Rhettors are staying safe out there and covid free :)"

j3knq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonU/comments/j3knq1/regarding_bu_college_republicans_and_dr_ibram/,Regarding BU College Republicans and Dr. Ibram Kendi,5,59,2020-10-01 17:26:59,"Let me just start this off by saying I am a liberal. I am pro-choice, pro gun control, pro single-payer, voted for Bernie in all the primaries, and will be voting for Biden this November. I think Trump is a piece of shit, racist idiot. I support none of Amy Coney Barrett's policies and want to wait until after the election (when hopefully Biden wins) for a more liberal and deserving nominee.

That being said, the hate that BU College Republicans are getting is absolutely absurd. In my belief, their only wrongdoing is calling for Dr. Kendi's removal, when he, as a university professor, and a citizen of the United States of America, has the right to free speech. I actually found myself appalled not by the statement from BU college republicans, but from Dr. Kendi. For those who don't know, here is a quote of what he said in reference to Supreme Court nominee Barrett.

""Some white colonizers ""adopted"" Black children. They ""civilized these ""savage"" children in the ""superior"" ways of white people, while using them as props in their lifelong pictures of denial, while cutting the biological parents of these children out of the picture of humanity.""

Dr. Kendi said all of this with a picture of Barrett and her family attached in his tweet. Dr. Kendi has the right to condemn Barrett. She is anti Roe v. Wade which makes her a POS in my book and unfit for the court. But bringing her family into it? Questioning her love for her literal children, even if they are adopted? Made me sick.

Dr. Kendi is right that a lot of white people love to justify how not racist they are. While he said in a later tweet that it doesn't matter whether or not he is referring to Barrett and her family, it is pretty clear that the attached image suggests that she is possibly using her children to hide her racism. He is essentially using the argument that ""just because you have a black friend/kid/whatever, doesn't mean you can't be racist."" This is a valid argument.

But, I can't help but be appalled by Dr. Kendi's implications. First of all, he implies that it can be racist to adopt children that don't look the same as you. It doesn't matter how good of a mother and how much Barrett loves her kids. He knows nothing about the close relationships of her family, and as far as I know, Barrett has never hid behind the argument ""I'm not racist, my kids are black."" Is it racist to save children from the mess that is foster care? Is it racist to save children from home environments where their parents can't take care of them for whatever reason? I am a foster child myself. I was saved by my mom and dad out of a terrible system. I am not the same race as my parents and I have never heard my white mother bring up how it was any different raising an Indian kid than it would be a white kid. Without knowing what kind of parent Barrett is, I found Dr. Kendi's implications to be pretty disgusting.

Then, BU college republicans made a post about it. Their post was wrong in my eyes on one count: Dr. Kendi shouldn't lose his job over something like this because he has the right to free speech, but the pure ignorance in the comments was making me sick. So many people commenting without knowing the extent to which Dr. Kendi made harmful implications about Barrett and her family. The same people in the comments without mob mentality are also statistically never going to adopt a kid. Only 2-4% of American families adopt children. They know nothing about Barrett's family, and statistically will never adopt a family, yet when it comes to making hateful instagram comments and reposting it on their stories they are all up in arms. There were many people claiming that reverse racism doesn't exist, yet display disdain and hate for white people. And when people try to reason in the comments, from both sides, they are shut down without any sort of intellectual reasoning or debate."

I received concerns from some of you about quiz 2. I'm writing this email to answer the most common questions that some of you have. If your concerns aren't addressed in this email, please resend me your email with details of the problem you have. 

So far you should be able to log in the Blackboard and check the feedback of quiz 2. The average and median of the quiz is 35.57, 38, respectively, with a standard deviation of 11.21. I went through your file and assigned an aggregated extra credit under the ""extra credit"" section. Therefore, if you don't get the final result correct, you do get some extra credits based on how clear your solution process was. I apply the same standard to each one of you, so if you find the extra credit is somewhat stringent, chances are that other students have the same view too. Hence I won't be able to offer any additional extra credit, because there's no point to inflate grades that applies to everybody. 

If you are still confused about some of the problems in the quiz, please feel free to drop by my office hour for more clarification."

I lived on campus for the semester because of shitty home environment and the lack of wifi at home. I had gone home for finals week because I had a mandatory naturalization interview in my home state. So for all of finals week I had been using the cellular hot spot connection on my phone to take exams online. It was slow but I didn’t have any problems with the slow connection until today, my last final. The professor requires that we have cameras on on zoom during the exam but I had been trying to connect for 30 minutes but it didn’t connect. Given that we only had 2 hours for the exam, I decided to just take the exam because I was running out of time. In the end, I uploaded the exam and assumed it would be alright. I made the mistake of assuming it wasn’t a big deal until I got hit with a email at 9pm from my professor saying he will count my exam as nontaken even though it was uploaded because I failed to show up to the zoom meeting. I replied explaining my circumstances. He refuses to reconsider because he says I didn’t reach out to him earlier but I genuinely did not realize it was a big deal. 

What can I do? I had studied really hard for this final and done considerably well in the class. If he disqualifies my final exam I would not be able to pass. I went from thinking I would get a A- to failing the course. Who can I reach out to for help? I am speechless and tired. Help."

I just started at a PhD programme this semester. Unfortunately, my C-PTSD and Dissociative disorders have begun to kick my ass. But I was doing so well when I applied, after two years of Ketamine infusion therapy. It wasn't enough of a problem to hinder my abilities anymore. 


Basically, there was a near violent robbery/attempted robbery at my apartment, mostly centred on my neighbour's gun, about a month and a half ago. Long story, but the investigation is ongoing and I'm the main witness (they also tried to violently break my door down). I haven't been able to sleep and the lack of safety just completely triggered my PTSD. I'm absolutely terrified of people again. The intense shame sends me into dissociative episodes, as my brain prepares for me to be violently punished for speaking. 
And I think this one professor might hate me now, because I haven't been able to think clearly enough to participate.


My writing sounds like gibberish, as well, now. Who the fuck knows what anyone thinks about me at this point. I'm trying to get certified through disability services, but that won't look good anyway. It's too taboo, risky and awkward to admit to anyone in control of my standing.


Anyway, I'm just wondering if this semester will be enough for them to kind of silently kick me out, somehow (can that happen?). I don't want to leave. I worked hard to get here and was doing well. It's taking forever to find a trauma focused therapist, but I'm seriously working on it. There's just no way to admit to anyone what's going on with the PTSD (though they know about the break-in).


Thanks for listening. I'm not sure if anyone has any advice. But I'm feeling awful right now and just felt like trying to reach out."

 ""Generally, academic records are reviewed for satisfactory academic progress on an annual basis. However, during the first semester of the academic year full-time students must successfully complete at least 8 credits with a minimum 1.00 grade point index (GPI).

Students who do not meet these minimum academic standards are very unlikely to meet the annual renewal criteria. Thus, falling short of first semester academic standards will result in a cancelation of second semester/term aid – first semester aid will remain intact.""

While these adjustments were made to reduce our community’s risk of exposure to COVID-19, we also understand that the removal of spring break creates a semester without many opportunities for students and faculty to take much-needed breaks from their academic work.

In order to provide students and faculty with additional opportunities throughout the semester to truly unplug and relax, the University will institute two “Wellness Days” in the spring 2021 semester: Thursday, March 18, 2021 and Wednesday, March 31, 2021. On these days, no classes may be held, no class work may be due, and no exams may be held. Please note that graduate schools with their own calendars (Medicine, Dental, Law, Public Health, and Social Work) and select programs with specifically articulated clinical schedules (Sargent, Wheelock) may choose to designate two alternative dates that work better for their calendars, rather than following the University’s scheduled Wellness Days. These days do not apply to online-only courses that run for seven weeks. Please contact your dean’s office if you have questions about how this impacts your program.

These Wellness Days, in addition to regularly-scheduled holidays for Presidents’ Day and Patriots’ Day, will provide a break in the academic calendar every 4-6 weeks throughout the spring semester. We hope that this gives you the opportunity to focus on your personal restorative needs – whether that be exercising, sleeping, tackling life-maintenance tasks, or catching up on work – as we all navigate this challenging time. The Wellness Project will offer students optional physically distanced opportunities to restore themselves on each of these days.

I understand that this calendar adjustment will require some faculty to adjust syllabi and potentially remove some planned content from their courses. While I regret this inconvenience, I hope that we can all embrace these Wellness Days as opportunities to recharge. Therefore, I ask that faculty refrain from overloading other class days with additional work to make up for these two days off – such would defeat the purpose of this effort.

Thank you all once again for your continued patience and flexibility throughout this time, and best wishes for a fulfilling and successful semester."

I've seen a lot of people asking about clubs and organizations that they can join, so I thought I'd signal boost this event. Of course I have to rep the Board Games Club, but there are hundreds of others that will have representatives there that you can talk to and get involved with.

Dear Prospective May 2021 Graduates and Families,

We have begun the spring 2021 semester with signs of hope after the protracted disruption and uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic. I am proud of how well our students have adjusted and adapted, sometimes on short notice, to remote and hybrid learning, to our testing and distancing protocols, and to the restrictions on cocurricular activities or the options for internships or study abroad. We recognize that the senior year for our undergraduate students has been very different from what they likely envisioned when they entered Boston University.

I am hopeful because the vaccines developed to protect against COVID-19 are now being dispensed nationwide. We are still dealing with a very constrained supply of vaccine from the state. Our assessment is that as the vaccine becomes more widely available in Massachusetts, in combination with other measures already in place, it will begin to put the brakes on the spread of the virus.

I am writing to tell you and our BU community our plans for Commencement events this May.

We are now planning to hold a live (i.e., in-person) Commencement ceremony for those who are eligible to graduate in May 2021 or September 2021, as determined by their school or college. The ceremony will be held at Nickerson Field on Sunday, May 16, and will be conducted with our [Back2BU](https://www.bu.edu/back2bu/) health protocols in place and in accord with state and local travel policies. Your ability to attend may be affected by state and local travel policies. Attendees will be limited to May 2021 or September 2021 graduating seniors and advanced degree recipients and a small platform party, including deans, administrators, and honorary degree recipients. Regrettably, we *cannot* offer the opportunity to invite family and friends. We are currently working on a plan to provide enhanced virtual access to the celebration so this important milestone in your life may be shared and enjoyed.

In addition to the Nickerson Field ceremony, we are planning to hold an open-air Baccalaureate service on the Alpert Mall (next to Marsh Chapel). Again, this will be conducted in accord with our Back2BU protocols, and attendance will be limited to graduating seniors and advanced degree recipients and a small group of deans and administrators.

Individual schools and colleges will offer virtual convocations.

Diplomas for all graduating students will be mailed rather than distributed locally.

We will be providing additional details in [*BU Today*](http://www.bu.edu/today/) as we move forward. I need to offer the cautionary note that our planning is contingent on both the progress made in fighting COVID-19 and decisions made by city or state officials about public gatherings. There have been enough ups and downs over the course of the past year to make all of us a bit guarded about what the future holds. We are moving forward in a spirit of optimism, but we are prepared to adjust our Commencement plans as needed. Our aim is to provide a Commencement that properly celebrates what you have accomplished.

Boston University has weathered the COVID-19 pandemic admirably because of the hard work of our frontline staff and our resilient students and faculty. While I would have wished for you a different conclusion to your higher education experience, I believe you will find in coming years that some of what you endured is instructive and fortifying.

Stay safe and well.

Sincerely,  
Robert A. Brown  
President"

The state has decided to prioritize mass vaccination centers, among other providers, and has halted distribution of the vaccine to all higher education institutions, including Boston University. As a result, we must suspend the University’s vaccination program for those who have not yet had their first shot. Members of the BU community who have already received a first dose on campus are expected to be able to get their second through the University as scheduled.

Obviously, we’re disappointed with this news, as we’re sure those of you hoping to get inoculated on campus are as well. We had put our vaccination program in place with the aim of immunizing as many BU community members as possible. With the state’s decision, however, it doesn’t look like we’ll be able to reach that goal anytime soon.

Once you are eligible according to the state’s phased distribution plan, we encourage you to get vaccinated at one of the state’s mass vaccination sites like Fenway Park, or other locations recommended by the state or your local physician. You can learn more and find locations by visiting the state’s vaccine finder or by calling 211.

We appreciate your patience and cooperation throughout this challenging and constantly evolving process. As soon as we receive more information from the state, we’ll be in touch with an update."

lwxw8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonU/comments/lwxw8f/a_response_to_the_south_campus_security_issues/,A Response to the South Campus Security Issues,87,40,2021-03-03 08:27:22,"BU Today recently published [this article](http://www.bu.edu/articles/2021/bu-police-arrest-suspect-in-case-of-south-campus-intruder/) regarding an arrest in the South Campus intruder case.

At the time of this writing, the sole comment on this talks about the issue of funding and renovating South Campus buildings to increase student safety. I have submitted the following comment, it has not yet been approved, and given the University's history with spin, I doubt that it will be. I'm submitting it here in the hopes that it will garner some attention and empower students to take action.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Last year, the University raised $1.85 billion in donations. Those funds have been invested into unspecified ""endowed scholarships, endowed professorships, endowed programmatics, capital projects, and sponsored programs."" While this information is available through a Bostonia publication, the writing uses a great deal of buzz words that draw the big red circle around a lack of transparency at Boston University.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;With this in mind, it should be no surprise that the University hasn't modernized its housing facilities with regards to security. We have no way of knowing if the funding is available or if it is potentially being allocated to improving student safety.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;At dormitories at Northeastern University, and other Boston area institutions, all student living spaces have digital locks that require either a swipe of the student's ID card, entry of a pin code, use of an app, or a combination of these safeguards. In any case, the doors lock automatically once closed, and can be unlocked manually from the inside.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The BU Student Villages are a recent construction, and yet, they also lack these locks. Arguably, due to a lack of these systems, a student was sexually assaulted in Student Village 2 in 2015 as reported by Naba Khan in the Boston Globe. The perpetrator had no authorization to be in the building, and yet, was able to not only make it inside a student's apartment, but into a student's bedroom.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;These incidences in South Campus could have been voided, and could continue to be avoided, if the University installed such digital lock systems across campus. South Campus locks are changed on a regular basis— they would not have to be changed if digital lock systems were implemented. It would be as simple as resetting a code barring physical damage to the locks themselves.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Given all of these aforementioned incidents, the question for BU Administration and Facilities now remains: Will the University explore the option of installing electronic locks across campus, and more importantly, will they actually do it?

I realize of course that this is perhaps better served as a ""Letter to the Editor"" for the Daily Free Press or BU Today itself, but given the spin that we see in University media, I thought perhaps this is the place to get conversations started. Do with this commentary what you will, but I ask that you all please take to heart the serious nature of this issue as well as the need to hold administration accountable."

I have been doing this for over a year, intentionally gathering an idea. Reddit is known to be ridden with white supremacy, racism, and ignorance that can be protected and upheld behind anonymity—so I’m not surprised that this is upheld even on a forum made for Boston University students. 

The unfortunate thing about anonymity is that people who decide to be racist, offensive, and hurtful on the internet can get away with it—and in this case, get away with it and likely graduate from an elite university with a degree, virtually unaffected by the damage they do online. They are able to carry their ignorance with them into the working world, where bias literally leads to the killing, mistreatment, and displacement of people of color. 

Boston is a beautiful city with immense amounts of culture. It is where we live 8-9 months out of the year—for some, even longer. It is a city also riddled with racial disparity, but held together by the communities most harmed by our collective student presence. Keep in mind that this does not only apply to Boston University, but all of the universities in the city—I only speak of BU because I am a student here. 

However, despite BU being placed in a city with a huge population of people of color, I feel as though this college town can be very lonely and isolating for many of us who attend. Maybe I am simply unaware of where to go or who to look for, but the most discouraging aspect of this is knowing that at least online—on this very Reddit—people are anonymously spewing racist, ignorant, hurtful rhetoric, and that these are people that attend class with me, dine in the same restaurants, live in the same dorms. 

Don’t get me wrong—I’ve made amazing friends who are white. I’ve made amazing connections and have learned to love this beautiful city, but I also cannot ignore how careless and harmful people are with the students of color here and the surrounding communities of color in the city. 

There will be trolls who read this and don’t care. There will be people who read this and respond and downvote out of ignorance and the goal of making me and other students of color feel as though we don’t belong. I foresee it and I accept it, but what I want to express to my other BU Redditors of color is that you all belong here. You all deserve to be heard and valued. Your presence is impactful, and I see you. You are allowed to say that something is wrong, or hurtful, or offensive. You should never let ignorance rid you of your voice. 

And with that, I wish you a happy end of semester."

I'm a prospective BU student, but it's emerging as one of my top choices. I have disabling medical conditions (Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and related comorbidities) and a learning disability. As I was doing research about BU, I came across a lawsuit against BU's disability services and a number of anecdotal reports of ableist treatment and difficulty receiving and then accessing accommodations. 

I require accommodations in order to function on a base level medically, so I'm a little nervous about potentially committing to a school where I would have a lot of trouble getting or accessing them. I'm not shy about self-advocacy, have a history of receiving accommodations since middle school, and am lucky to have a whole team of medical specialists to back me up plus a boatload of documentation, but I want to know what I'm getting myself into before I decide.

This class will go over unconventional techniques that aren't mentioned in the CS/CE curriculum, as well as ways of approaching difficult problems using what's honestly the equivalent of programming black magic. 

It will provide a perspective that is absent in more theoretical heavy classes by recognizing practical implementations in C++ (but we don't care what language you use. Unless it's OCaml). This class also brings in some competitive programming background, and if you want to get into ICPC (international programming competition) or just want to be able to solve Leetcode hard, feel free to sign up as well.

I got offered the BU Guaranteed Transfer option and I decided to accept it since BU has been my dream school for a while now, but the website does a pretty poor job on explaining the process so I was wondering if anyone who went through it could explain these questions for me 

When do they reach out after you accept the offer? 
What is the transfer college transcript thing? 
Is it fine as long as we literally maintain a 3.0 like the requirements say or should I consider maintaining at least a 3.5 in case they rescind/reject me since this isn’t really 100% guaranteed..?

I'm planning on living in a traditional double occupancy dorm and I'm currently looking at four options for housing: Kilachand, Warren Towers, Myles, or a brownstone on Baystate. I was very interested in Danielsen however its quite a hike from the CAS building. As this will be my first year at a 4-year i would like something that could provide that ""college experience"" and so warren towers seems like a no-brainer however i would really like a building with a common area kitchen as i prefer cooking for myself over eating out. Myles, Kilachand, and the Baystate brownstones have kitchens but Myles and Kilachand are a bit removed from central campus and i am not sure if living in a quiet brownstone my first year will provide the whole ""college experience"" of having a bunch of floor mates and getting to know a bunch of people (silly, i know, but it's something I'm really looking forward to). thank you for the help!!"

1. I'm going to be a senior next year so I'll be spending my last semester ever in London. I was supposed to be graduating in 2023 but I'm graduating a year early so to those of you who studied abroad in your last semester, did you have any regrets about not spending your last semester with your friends in Boston? Most of my college experience was during the pandemic because I only got fall 2019 as a normal pre-COVID experience, so I'm wondering whether I should just spend the last year I have in Boston with my friends. Anything about your experience studying abroad, even if it wasn't in London, would be super helpful here.
2. I'm a woman of color and I'm worried about safety in London, call me paranoid but I've had friends go to London (not as part of study abroad) and they've had nasty encounters. I know the U.S. isn't great in terms of that either, but I'm wondering whether anyone has had particularly bad experiences with racist attacks in London?
3. How did you sign up for a phone plan/which phone plan did you get?

* What's undergrad morale like? Are students generally happy, unhappy, kind of a mix?
* What does an average day look like for students? Classes, meals, exercise, sports, clubs?
* What does socializing look like on campus? What's weekend life like? Do students party a lot?
* Do you like your professors? Are they generally speaking quality instructors?
* What makes a good teaching fellow (TF)? Have you had any good, or bad, professors or TFs?

My roommate and I were assigned a bedroom in a 4 person apartment but it was later realized that the labels on the bedrooms (bedroom A vs. bedroom B) were different from how they were labeled on the floor plan. To clarify, bedroom A on the floor plan was the smaller of the 2 bedrooms but when we arrived at our actual apartment we found that the larger bedroom was labeled as ""A."" Obviously our housemates were upset that their bedroom ended up being smaller than they expected and BU housing is now telling us we need to switch bedrooms even though me and my roommate are assigned bedroom A in the portal and are in the bedroom currently labeled as ""A."" The floor plan clearly has a disclaimer at the bottom saying that the floor plan is not completely accurate and is subject to change. Me and my roommates have already completely moved in and unpacked and don't think BU housing should force us to change rooms. I get that our housemates want the bigger bedroom but they should have read the disclaimer on the floor plan when picking rooms during the housing selection period.

Nonetheless, I think I should still try my best to apply to scholarships. I've looked at many resources about scholarships located in the university's website as well as others.

Unfortunately, I'm really overwhelmed by all the information and need some help. Most important to me is that I'm not sure how to effectively and efficiently go about getting scholarships that suit my circumstances.

As we have now returned to primarily in-person operations, we have taken the opportunity to revisit our emergency closure policy, and are writing today to share how we will approach emergency campus closures moving forward.

In the event of a weather or other emergency, the University may close impacted operations and cancel classes on one or more campuses. **Moving forward, our expectation is that in the case of an emergency campus closure, classes will be cancelled and no administrative meetings or scheduled campus programs and activities will take place.**

BU staff or affiliates who perform on-campus essential services (defined in the updated [Emergency University Closing Policy](https://www.bu.edu/policies/emergency-university-closing/)) will be expected to report to their campus, and BU staff will be paid as detailed in the policy or in their applicable collective bargaining agreement. **All other staff are not required to report to their campus and are not required to work remotely;** they will be paid for their regularly scheduled hours when their campus is closed for emergency reasons.

We recommend that all staff review the updated [Emergency University Closing Policy](https://www.bu.edu/policies/emergency-university-closing/) found in the Employee Handbook, as it contains important details including the definition of “on-campus essential services.” We always hope that emergency closures are few and far between, but hope that this updated policy provides helpful clarity on what to expect when a campus closure or snow day occurs.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

tl;dr: Snow Days are still Snow Days, Zoom is even more useless in the eyes of administration lol"

The student population is full of depressed teacher pets. They brag about how much work they do more then you and then talk about killing themselves in the next breath. CFA has some of the worst professors i have meet in three prior years at college in my home state. They have zero regard for building students foundational sets, critical thinking, or actually form. They are far to concerned for appealing to the schools requirement we be a “research” institution. Ive had nothing but constant problems with professors being nosey, making classmates cry, being general unhappy pricks who never like anything. If i wasn’t financially tied down here I would leave, but i have no choice. So yeah i wanna bitch alittle. Please free to also bitch here"

The Isso just sent an email saying that BU apparently will continue in-person classes for the Spring even though the US might close its border and we will have to take a leave of absence for the Spring term.
