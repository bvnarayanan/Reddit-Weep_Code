66teds,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/66teds/major_crisis_in_deciding_where_to_attend_xpost/,Major crisis in deciding where to attend (X-post /r/Applyingtocollege),15,11,2017-04-21 18:29:26,"I'll preface this post by saying that I know that I am very fortunate to have been accepted to such selective schools. I understand that I am very privileged in my current position, but I am still experiencing some intense difficulty deciding between my current two top choices: Columbia and Brown.

Let me give some background for the situation I currently find myself in. Columbia has been my dream school for years. Ever since I first began thinking about where I might want to go to college, Columbia has been at the very top of my list. Columbia was the first school I ever visited, and I knew immediately that it was the place I wanted to end up. Taking all this into consideration, I applied ED in the Fall. I was deferred, and I was devastated. I let the college admissions process affect my own self-esteem far too much, and I spiraled into a bit of depression and anxiety that made it difficult me to do schoolwork or talk to my friends. I remember walking around my house, saying things like ""If I get into any school other than Columbia, I'll try to transfer after my freshman year."" I know all of the Columbia promotional material by heart and can recite it essentially verbatim. I hope this shows exactly how hard my heart was set on Columbia for so long.

So as you can imagine, I was ecstatic when I was fortunate enough to have been accepted to the class of 2021 during the regular decision round. I was also accepted to some other schools on March 30, including Brown. Up until this point, I had never visited Brown's campus, and I still had my heart set on Columbia, but I was pleasantly surprised to have the option.

Fast forward to Columbia's admitted students event: ""Days on Campus,"" which was held on April 9th and 10th. This was the first time that I had ever visited Columbia's campus while there were undergraduate students present--the other times I had always visited over the summer months. While all of the admissions officers and student volunteers seemed friendly, I felt as though the general student body held a general disdain for the prospies on campus. This belief of mine was confirmed by looking at Columbia's Yik Yak that day: several comments had been made along the lines of ""Prefrosh should jump off a roof"" and ""All these prefrosh are making me late to class."" Overall, I felt like I was not welcomed by most of students at Columbia, who made it abundantly clear that I was at the very bottom of the totem pole at a major institution with little regard for your individual troubles. I experienced some of what I had only read about before, and never quite understood: the bureaucracy of Columbia. After attending Columbia's Days on Campus, I feel like the word ""bureaucracy"" seems like a perfect fit for what the administration is like. Days on Campus seemed like a formality, accepting the next class of students into the whirring machine of advanced higher education that would spit out our generation's pushers and movers--but little else. Dean Valentini (who seems like a very nice man) gave a speech, as did the Dean of Admissions, Jessica Marinaccio. I felt that the staffers and organizers were doing the best they could, but it was difficult not to feel as though the entire event and the university as a whole was somewhat impersonal.

Beyond this, I wasn't entirely thrilled by the attitudes of some of the other prefrosh. Sure, there were plenty of nice people there, but there were also lots of students who seemed like they were just bragging about how they were trying to choose between Columbia and Harvard, but would probably just end up choosing Harvard. It seemed like a lot of the other people who attended the event went to private school (which isn't necessarily bad), but they brought with them a sense of prep school elitism that I had never really been exposed to before. There was an overwhelming sense of entitlement among many of the prospies that I was, quite frankly, appalled by. I have been fortunate enough in life to not experience hardship. I am thankful to have loving parents, teachers who care about me, and lots of friends who support me. Yet, despite my own privilege in life, I couldn't help but feel that many of the kids at Days on Campus were in a different stratosphere of wealth and were far more self-assured about their right to have a place at such an elite institution. Since being accepted to college, I have suffered to a certain extent from imposter syndrome, questioning whether I truly belong at such an amazing place. Yet, many of the prospies that I encountered at Columbia did not appear to feel similarly, and it honestly seemed like they had been afforded every blessing in life. I met kids who went to some prep schools, and had already mastered multivariable calculus and linear algebra before even entering college. As a prospective math major, I felt inferior to these students, when I myself had struggled through Calculus BC. It made me question whether I wouldn't be discouraged from attempting to pursue a math degree, because I was already so far behind many of the other students.

On top of all this, I got the overwhelming sense that the student population really was as stressed as people online reported. I heard several students comparing GPAs with each other, the general student did not seem overly happy. This actually reminded me of [a post from this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/63mj5v/columbia_university_a_student_perspective/), which made a similar comment:

&gt;When I see people walking around campus I don’t see much happiness or enthusiasm.

This comment seemed almost naive to me at first when I first read it a couple weeks ago. What do you honestly expect out of the student body of a top-ranked institution like Columbia? People there are serious about their studies and have a New York attitude--a certain sense of independence. Yet, looking around Columbia's campus a few weeks ago, I realized just how accurate this sentiment really is. People there certainly seemed ambitious--I overheard many a conversation about the latest internship or job offer. Yet, so few of the people I encountered seemed like they had the spark of passion in a subject that I had dreamed of. And still fewer seemed like they were actually enjoying themselves on such a beautiful April day. It reminded me of a comment I read on the Columbia subreddit a couple months ago, in response to someone who posted about recently being accepted: ""Get out while you still can.""

New York City, too was not what I had previously expected. I have been to New York a handful of times, always in awe of the buildings and culture there that is known the world over. However, on my most recent visit, I got the sense that I had never perceived before, of being entirely overwhelmed. I come from a very small town, where the pace is comparatively slow. Yet, when I found myself rushing to the subway so I could quickly get downtown to the hectic hellhole of Penn Station so I could get my train back home, I felt what I imagine is the hustle and bustle of a ""New York minute."" To be honest, I didn't like it. To me, it seemed as though I was more irritable than ever before. I felt like I had a disregard for other people as I pushed past them toward my final destination. Maybe it was only because I had drank a cup of coffee (something I don't often do), but I felt self-centered in a way that I was acutely aware of and did not necessarily enjoy. I had always assumed that I wanted to live in New York later in life, but I'm not certain such a stark transition would be good for me, and I'm very afraid that the climate of New York would only bring out the worst aspects of my personality, namely anxiety, stress, and a self-centered ego that makes me feel like I am the only important person in the world (I have certainly been guilty of this last one before).

Enter Brown. I attended their admitted students day this past week, A Day on College Hill (ADOCH for short). A Day on College Hill was literally the **best** three days of my entire life. It is the happiest I have ever been. All of the activities that they had us do were so much fun. From eating in the Ratty to going to the bookstore to check out all the cool merchandise to exploring Brown's beautiful campus, I absolutely loved it. I really cannot understate how much fun I had. I could really see myself on Brown's campus for the next four years. Brown had almost the exact opposite vibe of Columbia. My room hosts were incredibly friendly and helpful (not that my host at Columbia wasn't), and they went above and beyond to answer any questions I had. My host even took me to one of his classes, and told me about how his professor learned all of the student's names, even though it was a massive intro-level lecture. There was even an option to speak one-on-one with the admissions officer who had read your application. When I went to talk to the officer for my region, she was busy with another student, so I walked away. This lady was so nice that she e-mailed me the next day to meet up with me so that she could talk to me. She knew my name and the details of my entire application, and I felt really personally cared for. In addition, another senior admissions officer texted me personally and asked me if I had any questions and if I was enjoying my stay. When I was talking to that officer, she knew my name and exactly who I was, even though we had never spoken face-to-face before.

In addition, the students at Brown seemed incredibly friendly. One student stopped in the middle of his studying to ask if I had any questions or needed any help. He then walked with me outside to show me where I needed to go. Another student saw that I was confused when looking at a map and again offered to point me in the right direction. I felt welcome and cared for in a way that was 100% not the case at Columbia. The sense of elitism from Columbia was also not present on campus. All of the other prefrosh seemed genuinely interested in hearing each other's opinions and listening to what they were passionate about.

Many other students at ADOCH that were choosing between Columbia and Brown felt much the same way as I did. I spoke to two other people who both were choosing Brown over Columbia. One of these people goes to the high school in the county over from mine, and was almost as dead-set on Columbia as I was before attending ADOCH. Another girl I talked to seemed surprised when I said I was considering Columbia over Brown: ""But everyone is so laid-back and friendly here,"" she remarked, and I must admit she had a point. My host's roommate was also super chill, and honestly one of the coolest people I've ever had the pleasure to meet in my entire life. He said that a year ago, when he was deciding on a college, he was choosing between the University of Chicago (which, like Columbia is known for its stress culture and poor mental health) and Brown. He said he was so unbelievably happy he had chosen Brown, and that all of his friends were glad they did too.

In addition, I also was convinced of the effectiveness of the open curriculum at Brown, compared to Columbia's core. I had always been a fan of the Core curriculum, because it would give me the chance to learn about the great works that make up western civilization. I have always wanted to be well-versed in high culture, and attending Columbia would allow me to achieve this. I also have been enamoured with the Contemporary Civilizations and Literature Humanities courses, where I could learn about all the philosophy without having to take formal philosophy courses. I have always loved philosophy, and Columbia would offer me this sort of easy accessibility to great western works. While visiting Brown, however, I was convinced that the open curriculum is not without its own merits. I am not entirely certain that I want to pursue a degree in mathematics (I also have interests in stats, computer science, and economics--though I am wary of selling out to Wall Street). At Brown, I could perhaps pursue these interests to a greater degree, simply because I would have more time and freedom.

This all being said, there are a few problems I have with choosing Brown over Columbia.

I recognize that much of the reason why I am making this post is because I am still in love with Columbia. I have a massive issue with confirmation bias, and I am mostly making this post because I want someone to tell me that my fears are unfounded, and that I shouldn't focus so much on the intangible aspects of choosing a college. Instead, I should just be happy attending the school that has been the object of my dreams for years: ""the greatest university in the greatest city in the world.""

In addition, I am a little concerned that all of this worry over the choice of college is a manifestation of my own self-defeating tendencies. I am simply afraid that I won't be able to cut it at Columbia, and so I am filling myself with doubt so that I will attend Brown, where the students at the very least seem happy with their choice. There, I will still be challenged and have the smug superiority of having attended an ivy league university, but I will be in a more hospitable and accepting environment. This reflects one of the comments I heard at ADOCH this past week: ""Think about where you want to be when you are stressed out and need help. Brown provides a community... unlike some other schools."" This comment seemed specifically tailored to me.

Another problem is the sense of regret. If I attend Brown, I know I will regret not going to Columbia, which has been my dream for years. Instead of facing the stress of the big city and a major university, I know I will feel as though I simply avoided the issue instead of trying to deal with it (even though this feeling seems irrational and unfounded).

Prestige is another issue. Both these schools are ivies, so this literally doesn't matter, and I recognize this. Still, there's something that really just gets me deep down when I can say that I was accepted to the third most selective college in the nation. I get the same feeling when I think about saying to someone later in life, ""Oh, I went to school in New York"" or ""I had an ivy league education."" Something about being an ivy league new yorker makes you feel on top of the world and that's a difficult emotion to give up, even if it is irrational.

I am also wary of basing my entire decision off of three days of my life. Is the accepted students day really representative of what life in college is going to be like? I am so inexperienced and know so little about what it is truly like to be independent in college, that it is impossible for me to even tell. ADOCH was certainly fun, but is it worth changing my entire life trajectory over a single event? I don't think so, even now.

On a more concrete basis, I'm not entirely certain what to think about the pure math department at Brown. While Brown does have the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM), my host said that the professors in the pure math department for undergraduates were not the best. Instead, Brown has a very strong focus on applied math rather than pure math. That being said, I am not certain exactly which side of math I would like to pursue. Yet, I am afraid that I may be pushed closer to the applied side at Brown, simply because their applied department is stronger. In contrast, my childhood hero Brian Greene is a professor in the math department at Columbia. While I am under no illusion that I would be spending time with Dr. Greene, I still think it would be really awesome to attend the same college that he works at.

I am also very interested in getting involved with the radio station wherever I go to college. I absolutely love listening to NPR, and both Brown and Columbia have had alumni go to NPR (including Ira Glass and Robert Siegel, respectively). Yet, the future of Brown's radio station has recently been called into question, as they are considering selling it. Though it does not look like the motion to sell will pass, it is something I am considering, as Columbia's radio station seems to be just as strong if not stronger than Brown's.

In addition, I would like to join marching band in college, especially since it was one of the activities I most enjoyed during high school. Both the Brown and the Columbia bands are similar--they have a ""scramble"" format--but Columbia's band also does Orgo Night, a beloved night of comedy the evening before the Orgo Chem final. I am interested in writing comedy and feel like this might be a good outlet for me to explore that interest. Several members of the marching band at Columbia even live in a suite together. Perhaps this would bring me the sense of community that I so desperately desire at such a faceless institution.

To complicate matters, there's an element of this entire issue that I haven't even discussed yet. I also got into the University of Pennsylvania, and now I feel like I never gave it a fair shake in this entire process. After having visited both Penn and Columbia before, I had decided that given a choice between the two, I would choose Columbia. I was so confident in this decision that I did not even attend Penn's accepted students day, and with ten days remaining before I have to commit, it seems like there is little chance that I will be able to visit any of these schools before deciding. Yet, I cannot help but feel that since I seem to have misjudged both Columbia and Brown, could I not have done the same thing to Penn? It always seemed to me that the choice between Penn and Columbia was obvious--a choice merely between New York and Philly. Both excellent institutions with similar student bodies and similar goals, just different locations. Now, however, I have come to realize the importance of intangible aspects of universities at a time that seems almost too late. Would I have preferred the social aspect of Penn, as it is known as the social ivy? I might never know, and that is a difficult truth for me to face. I am used to having complete information when making a decision, but it appears that this simply is impossible in my current situation.

And now, let me arrive at the crux of the entire scenario I currently find myself in. The single greatest issue that is making this decision difficult for me. The main reason why I am using a throwaway account to make this post right now. I met this really cute girl while I was visiting Brown.

I realize that this is the single stupidest thing ever. But we really hit it off, and I can't help but think that it made my entire visit to Providence seem way better than it actually was. I don't want this to define where I go for the next four years, and I need to make sure that it won't. I have worked so hard for years, and I can't let this stupid crush change the way I live the rest of my fucking life.

So, please help me reddit. I have relied on this subreddit heavily in the past, and I need your guidance now more than ever. The agony of this decision is killing me. I would like to thank you if you made it to the end of this post, because I realize that I have rambled on for quite a bit longer than I was originally expecting. But, I felt it was important for me to parse all of my thoughts out, and it seems only fair to give you the entire background of my story.

Any advice at all is appreciated."

I just started at Brown a little over a month ago but it is not going well. I took four classes, as was recommended, but the fourth one I just cold-turkey joined a week and a half into shopping period. This culminated itself into an email in which I asked the Prof. really simple questions which he supposedly  answered in the first week of class (while I was not there), him responding with statements about me being disengaged in the class as a result of this, and tossing a couple daunting (made up for me on the spot) catch up assignments my way, and fueling my consequent fear of asking for help in that class from that point forward. I took his first exam recently, and got a 19.5 out of 100, despite studying, attending class and sections, then spending the night before his test reviewing lectures and what not.

Okay, no big deal; all I need are 3 passed classes to remain in good academic standing, but it did not look like this is one that I would pass. I gave up on it, stopped attending, and planned to drop it to focus my attention on my next scary obstacle: my Logic class.

Now at this point I had already realized I was struggling and scheduled a meeting with an academic coach. They emailed me a Friday afternoon about wanting to meet on Sunday. Now, I had my work schedule for the last few weeks now and could have sworn I made myself unavailable on the coach application for that time, but they wanted to meet right as I went in for a shift. I couldn't do that and emailed the Academic Coaching email to let them know and ask about rescheduling. No response, so then late Friday night, I found my coach's individual Brown email and similarly explained the situation. No response, and this was all on around October 1st. Suffice to say I won't be receiving coaching...?

Anyways, I had to focus on my Logic class now, which had a midterm on the Friday the 13th (go figure). I had not done too well on the problem sets, but used them to study, throughout the week leading up to the test, crammed a crash course, and memorized some laws and stuff leading up to the test. I just got my grade back for that, and its a 44. Now, If I ace EVERYTHING from here on out (keep in mind my current performance here is 40 on problem set 1, 40 on ps2, and 44 on midterm) then I would finish with a solid C-. I don't see that happening though. 

So what do I do? I'm at a loss. Every time I talk to my parents about my struggling they attribute it to me not trying hard enough. But I left my game consoles at home, I do my assignments on time, and I feel like I'm trying harder than I ever had in high school by a nearly exponential proportion. I have no family with experience at college and had no clue about what I was walking into. I feel like I'm wasting my money, my parent's money, my effort and time as well as disappointing everyone. I could use some guidance"

The couple fears that I have is that i'm not going to be intelligent enough and that i kind of suck at programming(at least when i tried doing it). How collaborative are the students and did you already know programming when you majored in APMA-CS? 

Sorry if this is a bit sloppy. Thank you"

Piazza is almost useless, as the TAs respond to my questions with either nonanswers or more questions to which I don’t know the answers. The only other thing I’ve been doing is TA hours, but it’s not sustainable to wait an hour to get a single question answered every time I’m stuck. Also the collaboration policy is a huge pain in the ass and in addition to “preventing cheating,” it makes it impossible to get my questions answered from classmates, or study CS with anyone in general.

Here's a bit about my experience there,67,13,2019-03-04 08:14:22,"I'm a little hesitant to write about this, but I did get a weird, slightly guilty feeling from attending and what I saw, so I thought I'd write a bit about it.

I obviously want to keep anonymous because of the current atmosphere around here, but for a bit of background: I was certainly invited because of my parents' stature and relationship with MG. My parents are pretty wealthy, but no one you would've heard of unless you happen to be closely connected to the industry my mom is huge in. My dad is also a kind of bigwig in a specific medical field, so they've known MG for a while now and it's just kind of a professional courtesy for him to invite people like me.

Anyway, they got a lot of stuff right in the ProJo article, so I'll skip that mundane stuff and try and add what I can with my perspective. I actually went last year, not this year (for embarrassing, Bajas related reasons), but I assume it was pretty similar.

As my Lyft approached Al Forno, I tried to remember what my parents had told me in preparation for the dinner: mention them by name (so MG knew who I was), talk to him about my interest in business, and something about the word ""fidelio"". I checked the pockets of my Canada Goose to make sure I hadn't left my iPhone XS Max and Juul in the car, and walked in. When I got to receptionist at Al Forno, I mentioned that I was there for the MG dinner. She told me that it was actually a private event, but asked me if there was anything else I wanted to mention? I was kind of confused, but remembered what my dad had said and mumbled ""uhh, f..fidelio?"" She gave me a knowing smile and welcomed me. Huh, I thought my dad had just been joking.

She started walking into the kitchen, so I just stood waiting, but after a couple seconds she realized I wasn't following her and told me to follow. Weird! I followed her, past the delicious wafts, to the back right corner of the kitchen. We got to a huge, knurled door that looked *very* out of place in the back of Al Forno's otherwise modern-clean kitchen, but it didn't look bad, either. Strangely, there was no handle on the door, but there was a small hole in the wall, about an inch wide, at about ankle height, from the door. She told me to hang on a sec, and knelt down. I couldn't see super well because the area by the door wasn't lit very well, but she definitely reached into her mouth, winced a little, and then put something into the hole. The door immediately creaked open and I stepped into the foyer. The receptionist wiped the corner of her mouth and told me to enjoy. The door closed behind her, and I noticed that this side didn't seem to have a handle, either.

Even the foyer was nice, though a tad strange. There was a doorman, but his eyes were closed and he didn't speak. He did, however, gesture for my coat, whimpering a little, and I handed it to him. He reached into his pockets (which seemed to make...wet sounds?) and produced a token in exchange for my coat. It was a little lock of red hair, about 3"" long, with a LV band around it. It seemed like there were little clumps of skin at one end of the lock of hair, but that's probably just some fashion thing I don't understand. 

I entered the main room, and damn, it was pretty! I went to the wine bar, where there was another man similar to the doorman. I got a wine of a name, color, smell, and taste I had never seen before. Everyone was already mingling. I saw a few people I recognized from class there, talking to wealthy looking older folks. It's kind of funny, when you imagine a special event with the ""ultra rich"", you might imagine $4,000 tailored suits, but most of these people were...pretty casual. A lot of dadcore, bad docksiders with baggy polo shirts, if you catch my drift. Then again, I guess you can dress like that when you buy and sell lesser lives as a side business. 

Except for MG. Though I had never actually met him, despite going to his nephew's Bar Mitzvah ages ago, I guess I expected a typical 81 year old man. He was anything but. The first reason you'll notice him is that he's gotta be 6'8"", maybe more since he was hunched over to talk to the craven plebes near him. He's also just... *bronze*. And not in a trashy Trump way, but like he just got off the yacht from Mallorca. He's also weirdly yoked. He was wearing a beautifully tailored suit, in light tan, but it actually looked almost white against his glowing golden skin. And it wasn't of any material I had ever seen; it had an amazing texture, like leather, but finer, smoother.

I had only been admiring him from a distance, passing the time until I got a chance with him by talking to another alumnus about his visionary business leveraging blockchain tech for disruptive AI to harness CRISPR or something. MG was periodically scanning the room he could see, but I was at about a 160 degree angle behind him, so he never saw me. As the alum was saying something about big data derivatives and his ethical role in tanking the Haitian economy, I suddenly started hearing... I'm not sure, Icelandic? chanting in my head. It seemed like no one else in the room could hear it. It was quickly getting louder and louder, drowning out the visionary, and I began to sway on my feet. Suddenly, I saw MG's head whip around to look me directly in the eyes, and it stopped as if I had never heard anything.

He excused himself from the current gaggle with a well-timed outro quip and lurched over to us. I say lurched, because I've never seen anything move like that before. It wasn't awkward; if anything, it was stealthy and elegant. It might be partly because of his size, but I didn't even hear any of his footsteps. He introduced himself with a rogueish smile and said  ""...and you must be ___ ________"", using my nickname that only my closest friends call me. Closer, he smelled faintly of sandalwood, and the hair on the back of my neck stood up. While intently asking me about my interests, at one point he sneezed. It could have been the mystery vino and soft lighting, but I swear that as he was opening his eyes post-sneeze, they seemed to open sideways. 

I honestly don't know how long we talked, or what we talked about, but it felt like hours. He was wonderful at conversation, polite yet engaged, making it seem like what I was saying at that moment was the only thing in the world he cared about. He asked how my family was doing, and asked me in which order I would consume them. When I caught a glimpse of my watch, it said 7:50, but that didn't really make sense: the watch's hour hand was barely past the 7, and I had gotten out of the Lyft at 7:35 PM. But I wasn't going to complain; talking to him was the happiest I had been in as long as I could remember.

Finally it was my turn to lose him, and he excused himself. He lurched to the center of the room and the lights dimmed slightly. We all instantly stopped (how could you not?) and turned our gazes to him, though it felt out of my control anyway. He barely moved his lips, but his voice filled the room, almost painfully loud. The red velvet on the walls suddenly seemed a little redder. He uttered that he had summoned someone very special there tonight, and from a spiral staircase in the center of the room that no one had noticed until that moment, up came Christina Paxson. She was wearing a Supreme hoodie that they had only released a non-integer number of, as well as Stan Smiths, but they weren't the classic white. They were a color and texture similar to MG's suit.

He said that it was time to consume of the knowledge of The Book. From her Fjallraven Kanken, CPax withdrew a tome of a texture not unlike her shoes, telling us it was a very special one from the John Hay library and that its contents would allow us to maximize the material in our capitalist paradise. As she said that, her eyes glimmered, and something in MG's pants rustled.

Oh, and what secrets they were. Though they were speaking backwards, alternating words, we understood all and I cannot go back to the time before. They told us to walk the garden of forking paths, but beware the fox eating itself. They told us that recycling is nonsense and that though gender is arbitrary, so is human life, so don't feel guilty if you must carve a mural of pain into flesh to succeed in the world of business. They told us how to fold a fitted sheet and to invest in vape-pacifiers, because they heard a hot tip that they would be legalized by 2023. Periodically, MG climbed into an Apparatus that inscribed these words into his back.

They began to tell us of MG's philanthropic miracles. His gills flared wealthily, and four of the eyeless eunuchs brought out his first generous donation to Brown: a life sized metal bull, almost as bronze as the deity himself. They also dragged out a cowering, nude, filthy child, his pupils the size of dinner plates, on a Gucci 2018 A/W leash. The eunuchs opened a door on the bull's rear, and MG produced from his beautiful suit an LED fidget spinner. Instantly the child snapped to attention, transfixed on the spinner. MG tossed it into the bull, and the child, released, scrambled after it on all fours into the bull. To be fair, it was a pretty sweet fidget spinner. They slammed the door shut and lit a fire beneath it, and then everyone clapped.

As the first hors d'oeuvres were being brought out by his wretched minions, CPax unzipped her humanskin. ""Holy shit"", I thought. ""They have *pigs in a blanket?""*"

This is a completely valid concern, of course. College is stressful, and big, and most of the time, you don't know a single person there. But as someone who went from having zero to many friends, I'm here to tell you, that you will eventually find your people.

I didn't actually have that many friends for the first half of freshman fall. The people I hung out with at orientation were the people who lived on my floor. And while I really liked them, and enjoyed the time we spent together, I never really clicked into the group. I got so worried about the fact that everyone I talked to seemed to have some group of friends to hang out with, but I didn't. I felt like the only person who wasn't in a group.

It took a little bit of time, and some effort, to start slowly building a network of friends around me. I met a girl in one of my classes, and around the middle of the semester, actually mustered up the courage to talk to her. I started getting closer to people on my sports team. I met people through clubs, random activities, or just in chance encounters in a library.

Now, as I go into my junior year, I have many friends that I didn't meet until sophomore spring. Hell, I made some new friends just this week that already feel like close companions. So don't stress about not having a group of people in your first week here; friends will come, and they'll be worth the wait."

(see title)

I currently go to Rice as a declared CS major. The main reason I'm considering transferring at all is because I'd wanted to be at a school where the humanities and arts are seen as a high-quality cultural thing that people love doing and contributing to. I like STEM, and I love painting and making visual art, but Rice doesn't have much of the latter going on and I've felt like it's been hard to be passionate about everything going on when this part of my life is missing.

Disclaimer, my experience has been limited (still a freshman about to enter second semester, therefore I don't know a ton of people) but as far as I can see, Rice is actually super limited in the arts and humanities. A lot of the culture is stem-focused, industry-focused, etc. and honestly I don't really vibe with it and desperately wish there were more of a (visual) arts presence on campus. What about Brown? Would it be naive to try to go here and expect it to be way better in this regard? Would trying to go to Brown for the humanities/arts culture be similar to sticking it out and carving out my own path with visual arts here at Rice? The lack of arts culture here has kind of been getting me down.

1. For comp bio concentrators: What is the best part of being a computational biology concentrator? The worst part (or something you wish you had known)? Is it relatively easy to get involved in research as an undergraduate? What are the internship prospects? Overall, is the Brown Center for Computational Molecular Biology a good place to learn more about the subject and the latest research in the field?
2. For any Brown student: You have all probably gotten this question before, but are the granola/stoner stereotypes true? In general, what is your favorite part about Brown’s culture? What is the worst part about Brown’s culture? What are some of your favorite campus traditions? For some perspective, is Providence similar to any college towns in the Midwest?

I’m a rising senior who’s very interested in applying ED to Brown. 

I love, love, love the Open Curriculum, the culture/vibes of the school (everyone seems happy and genuinely willing to help each other—that’s exactly what I want in a college experience), the size of the school, the semester system (I don’t think I’ll do well with the time crunch of quarter), the focus on undergrad students, etc. Basically, I really love Brown. 

The only thing holding me back from committing 100% to applying ED is Brown’s Financial Aid. I ran the NPC and (from what I know, Brown looks at house equity—that’s probably why I get much less financial aid here than I would at other top-tier schools) Brown is extremely expensive for my family to afford :(

I have a younger sister who’s now entering middle school, and I don’t want to take away any opportunities from her because of the financial stress I’ll place with my Brown tuition. My grandparents offered to pay my entire college tuition (I am extremely lucky and grateful for their offer), but I don’t want to place a burden on them either. I would like to avoid going into debt for undergrad as much as possible, especially since I’m considering going to law school in the future. 

My heart is torn because I want to maximize my chances of getting into Brown by applying ED (and also finishing the college app process early), but I don’t want to be a financial burden to my family or myself.

He's a good man, although I can't comment about his willie. But this class really crushed my soul. I'm seriously just failing to grasp basic concepts about anything, in a class that is for freshmen.

Recently he released a list of topics for the oral final exam, where he listed a bunch of example questions, which he considered basic and fundamental concepts. Now I have to agree, from my limited knowledge, that they were both basic and fundamental. So given that, I should be able to answer them pretty easily right? Or talk about them, as it were. But this just isn't the case. I honestly wonder if I've learned anything, despite grinding out the problem sets every week and consistently getting like 80% of them eventually. When we were covering chapter 6 it probably took me over 25 hours just to get through and understand 7 of the 8 questions. All this for an intro math class. Math majors, how do you do it?

At the end of the day, I'm probably going to get a B or something, assuming I do well enough on the final project. But I can't help but wish I was competent enough to understand any of this."

It also does not say on their website, and common app does not have a location for it under guidance counselor rec (only optional report and mid year). I tried emailing admissions and got an automated response. My counselor doesn’t know either, but I figured you guys might. 
So does anyone know where to submit this?"

Because of a lot of family stuff and legal stuff going on, I ended up getting a D in on of my classes on the progress report,but my final grade in the class will be a B/A because I’m getting caught up. However, I am worried brown won’t see that and I’ll get rejected because of this progress report. My counselor has put a note for me with my report explaining my situation and I uploaded a supplement explaining the grade as well. Do you think this will impact my chances badly? Is there anything else I can do? Should I talk to an AO?"
