6jq0dj,https://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/6jq0dj/warning_about_penn_state_parents_facebook_group/,"Warning about ""Penn State Parents"" Facebook group",45,11,2017-06-26 20:06:49,"So my parents were introduced to the moderated ""Penn State Parents"" facebook group, home to nearly 6000 parents of alum and current students. Many of my other friends' parents are also involved in this group. 

Now I am not here to toot my own horn, but I am a recent alum of the CoE and I was pretty successful by most metrics. Of course there were ups and downs, but like many students, I found ways that personally helped me succeed. 

From time to time, my mom will share with me posts from the page of parents asking for advice for their children. These questions range from ""should my kid take such and such AP Credit"" to ""is my kid doomed in engineering/finance/cs"" to ""What is the best dorm to live in as a freshman"". 

Sometimes, I read the advice of parents that speak from their own childrens' experience and it is always given in absolutes. These suggestions are typically offered with little to no justification of what it said or acknowledgement that this is advice from an INDIVIDUAL'S PERSONAL experience. Frankly, reading some of the advice that these parents gave that I thought was horrible made me sick to my stomach. 

I just have a warning that if your parents get the Penn State Parents bug and post a question on your behalf, take whatever second hand, ill-informed suggestion from these parents with a grain of salt. While these parents mean well, ultimately, college is an individual experience. Getting advice is never a bad thing, but nothing should ever be taken as an absolute.

In your case, maybe it's best for you to drop out of engineering instead of taking a parent's advice to stick with it after failing calc 3 times because their kid did it. Or maybe you should stick in engineering despite taking a parent's advice to get out while you can because their kid failed calc 3 times too and they dug themselves into an insurmountable hole. You can probably catch my drift. "

6f2q5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/6f2q5m/discussion_questions_regarding_spanier_et_als/,"Discussion: Questions regarding Spanier, et al's Sentencing",21,14,2017-06-03 11:34:33,"As you all know, the former PSU administrators were [given their sentences yesterday](http://www.statecollege.com/news/local-news/spanier-curley-and-schultz-get-jail-time,1472564/) for their single misdemeanor (each) of EWOC:

*Graham Spanier*: former President of Penn State

- two months in county jail
- two to 10 months of house arrest with electronic monitoring
- Fine of $7,500 and 200 hours of community service

*Tim Curley*: former athletic director

- three months in jail
- 20 months of house arrest
- fine of $5,000 and 200 hours of community service

*Gary Schultz*: former senior vice president

- two months in jail
- three to 21 months of house arrest
- fine of $5,000 and 200 hours of community service

I was surprised by some of Judge Boccabella's comments:

- [""These men are good people who made a terrible mistake,"" Boccabella said. ""That mistake, however, was an inexcusable failure… Why no one made a phone call to police … is beyond me.""](http://www.statecollege.com/news/local-news/spanier-curley-and-schultz-get-jail-time,1472564/)

- He also seemed skeptical of Spanier’s culpability in the ordeal, stating [""I’m not so sure that you were totally responsible for the lack of action""](http://www.pennlive.com/news/2017/06/judge_slams_paterno_mcqueary_a.html)

- While Boccabella’s critique of JoePa was described as ""slamming"", it seemed pretty reasonable. [""Mr. Paterno, the legendary football football coach, could have made that phone call without so much as getting his hands dirty.""](http://www.pennlive.com/news/2017/06/judge_slams_paterno_mcqueary_a.html)  He simply stated that Paterno could have done more: pretty much what everyone has said, including Joe himself (with the benefit of hindsight).

What really shocks me is the harsh accusation from the OAG:

- [Deputy Attorney General Patrick Schulte also pointed a finger at Paterno for the cover-up itself, saying the trio of administrators had intended to report Sandusky to child welfare officials until they met with Paterno after the shower incident.](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-pennsylvania-sandusky-idUSKBN18T1BC)

This is in sharp contrast with previous [prosecutors](http://deadspin.com/prosecutor-from-sandusky-trial-joe-paterno-not-involve-1252192930) and [OAG officials](http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2011/11/paterno_praised_for_acting_app.html) whom have stated Joe was cleared of legal wrongdoing.  Unless I'm missing something, [Curley said it was his decision alone not to report Sandusky and Paterno did not influence him, as some of inferred from that email.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/colleges/former-penn-state-president-graham-spanier-convicted-of-child-endangerment/2017/03/24/d1936e34-109a-11e7-9b0d-d27c98455440_story.html?utm_term=.e5c31a166306) On top of that, the conspiracy and obstruction charges were dropped for all three.

Here are my questions:

1. **Since he called the former administrators ""good men"", does that mean he thinks the whole ordeal was negligence, rather than a ""heinous cover-up"" as the prosecution has alleged?**

2. **While Boccabella criticized Paterno and Deputy AG Schulte accused Paterno of ""masterminding the coverup"", what are the actual chances Paterno would have been charged with anything? Or was the AG that just grandstanding to make the conspiracy charge more convincing?**

3. **The Paterno Lawsuit against the NCAA is the only remaining major civil suit left in this whole ordeal, how will the sentencing, the judges comments, and Schulte's accusation impact the Paterno case?**
4. **How strong is the Paterno estate lawsuit against the NCAA overall?**"

You'll love Penn State, but you won't love the winters; get a down parka. Uniqlo's Warm Tech Down Jacket that they put out every year is a cheap alternative to spendier options like Canada Goose. Regular down jackets work ok, but they are less wind resistant, and stuff like North Face fleece jackets won't block the wind at all. Down parkas will have a wind resistant outer layer + the insulation of down. Winters are cold, wet, and windy. Scarves, gloves, and ear muffs (if you don't want to wear a hat/hood) are essential.

As for more advice, look for apartments as soon as possible, the good ones get snatched up extremely quickly. Many people start looking in early fall. Also, join a club or other social org or join a mentorship program. College takes time to adjust and many underclassmen have issues starting out. Having an upperclassman to impart wisdom can make all the difference. Speaking of seniority; fakes do not work downtown, don't try (the reason for this is that all bar staff is required to go through a several hour long course on how to spot fake IDs, as SC makes it extremely costly for bars to be caught with underages). Finally, the Knowledge Commons Service Desk in the library does tech repairs (no phone screens though) and wifi setup for free. Anyways, there's a bunch of hidden gems in the area. Check these out-

Downtown-

* China Dragon- a personal love of mine. Chinese food, pay with cash, $7 for 3 choices of sides and rice, plus a drink or soup.
* Big Bowl- Chinese food, cash only. Absolutely fantastic but kinda out of the way unless your classes are on the east side. Everything here is pretty great, but the safest option is the tender crispy chicken. It's basically chicken katsu. Their wings are excellent too, most people don't know that. Steamed beef tendon noodle soup is also great, upgrade for about a buck to egg noodles if you want to make it a bit better. Chili oil is available at the front too.
* Cozy Thai- gets very crowded for dinner but great, consistent food. Lunch is well priced and comes with a great vegetable soup.
* Saint's- great cafe with great coffee. In nice weather, grab a seat outside and study, read a book, or just people watch.
* Margarita's Pizza- **Go here from the start.** I started going in 2014 and wish I'd gone earlier. Margaret is the nicest person you'll ever meet and she'll adopt you as one of her kids. She and her husband Juan will make you feel loved even when you're feeling lonely and missing home. State College has a lot going for it, but sometimes its painfully apparent that you're in the middle of nowhere, away from your loved ones. A smile and hug can make all the difference, and if there's one thing Margarita's always has, it's that. All the food is good and priced well. There's a card minimum, so bring cash.
* Herwig's Austrian Bistro- Spendier, but great Austrian food and they have fresh specials that change every week or so. Really nice owner.
* Little Sichuan- really good Sichuan Chinese food. Gets extremely crowded for dinner as pretty much every international Chinese kid (not an exaggeration) will come then. The fish hotpot is great, so is the house spicy chicken. Haven't really had any duds ordering here. I'm Chinese and from the NYC area, so I was surprised how good this was.
* Appalachian Outdoors- Bet you didn't expect this on the list. But it's on here for a good reason; it's a UPS dropoff point. You'll most likely be buying a lot of stuff online in SC, and a lot of returns, especially for Amazon, are via UPS. Before this past year, you had to make your way down South Atherton to the UPS store to do so.

Needs a car-

* Meyer's Dairy- Fresh milk (if you have acne issues with milk, I had none with theirs) and other local goods + fresh ice cream that they make. People will say Berkey Creamery is the best; I'll say that Meyer's is.
* Kamrai- Thai and sushi. The only decent sushi place in the area other than Tadashi (Tadashi has good sushi but I hate their ramen, they cheap out on it by not cooking the pork belly properly; instead, they cook it in the ramen to stretch the broth further + make it cheaper for them to produce the pork belly chashu), but their Thai food is excellent. Definitely get the crab fried rice.
* Naked Egg Cafe- Fantastic date/brunch spot, but the popularity has exploded since they opened a few years ago, and they still have issues dealing with it. Get here at 9 am at latest on the weekends; people will start pouring in by 9:30. Excellent corned beef and pancakes. Avoid the chicken waffles though, it's basically chicken tenders on a Belgian waffle.
* Ni Hao Buffet- Your generic, unhealthy Chinese buffet with a sushi bar. They offer AYCE lunch for around $10 IIRC every day except for Sunday (all day dinner pricing).
* Otto's- They make their own beer and a custom one for Zeno's, but the only one I enjoyed was the Apricot Wheat, as well as the Zeno's Rye (only at Zeno's). Check for the 21+ hours, fantastic fresh food.
* American Ale House- Surprisingly, I never made it up to here while I was at Penn State, but my roommate swears by it. Similar to Otto's.
* Happy Valley Brewing Company- Direct competitor to Otto's, but the food is more traditional American steakhouse style. Fantastic steak tartare if you're feeling spendy.
* The Field Burger &amp; Tap at Toftrees- Roommate used to manage this, so this holds a special place in my heart. Best burgers in town, bar none, as well as the best, completely overdone milkshakes. They also offer a variety of fries that they'll bring out in a bucket and dump onto a wax paper sheet on your table. $7 for enough fries to feed 4-6 people.
* Rothrock Coffee- One of the only two decent coffee places in town, the other being Saint's. They roast their own coffee, owned by a BMX champion whose wife owns the fitness studio next door. People will claim WC Clarke's coffee is great, I'm sorry, but it's not.
* Doan's Bones- the one that's far from the school and on the way to Whipple Dam. The one downtown is terrible, avoid it.
* Whipple Dam- If you're at PSU for a summer, go here for a small lake beach with paddle boats and paddle surfing.
* Mount Nittany- Hike this at least once before you graduate, it's beautiful in the winter too. The regular paths are very doable, and with a decent pair of boots, you'll do fine.
* Don Patron- Mexican food, they'll give you a ton of food for what you pay, and they have happy hour specials. This ones a favorite with the people who live up on N. Atherton as it's next to Walmart.

I'll close in saying that if you're looking for a job in college, apply [here](http://labconsulting.sas.psu.edu/employment) in the spring (they open applications the semester beforehand, usually in Feb for the coming fall semester). Easy workload that consists of helping people in the computer labs, checking the printers, and you can do homework while you work."

Last night a couple of friends told my wife that they would not send their kids there if it was free-- ""anywhere but Penn State"".  They were like this even before the Sandusky business and have been talking for years about how they hope the scandal will destroy the school.

I come from the Midwest, where passionate college fans are pretty common, so Penn State does not seem that unusual/awful to me.  What is wrong with people who love their school well after college?  We have not heard any rationale explanation for what I started calling Nittanyphobia-- Fear of Penn State.  

Does anyone here have insight about the hatred in Philly about Penn State?  Why do people in Philly hate the school so much?  Is there a reason that I should be worried about sending my daughter to a ""blue and white cult""?

Thanks for your advice!"

I thought ""okay that's weird, I don't remember having to do this in the past, but whatever.""  So I re-enroll, and then call the pharmacy back. After being put on hold several times, they finally ask me if I'm a grad student (yes). They then inform me that ""Oh, your insurance doesn't become valid until October."" So without any warning from the university at all, I, and as far as I can tell all graduate students, suddenly don't have insurance until October. Penn State has said to just ""hang on to our receipts"" for reimbursement, but that's a joke. If I get in a serious car accident or get extremely sick, I can't afford to deal with that, that's why I fucking have insurance. They can't just say ""Oh you pay for it, and then we'll pay you back."" Fuck that, I have insurance to avoid that very issue.

And the worst part is, nobody told us. I had to find out when I tried to fill a prescription. If this was something that was unavoidable for the school to do, then we should have been receiving emails about it for months, and there should have been an information dissemination campaign with flyers posted all over campus.

My girlfriend found a kitten today out in the rain that was among its dead littermates. We've taken it home for the night, but aren't sure what to do with it. We called PAWS, and they said that they would try to get in touch with us by the end of the night (they close at 7:00-- so we're not feeling too hopeful there). It seems to be about 6 weeks old. It's really skinny, and malnourished. We've been trying to bottle feed it, but it seems kind of out of it, and won't take the bottle. We don't know what to do, and we're looking for any advice on who may be able to take it in. Thanks in advance. 


Edit: 
Little dude made it through the night alright and had a lot of energy this morning. Had to get up at 2:30 to syringe feed him (which he's totally not a fan of). We never heard back from PAWS, and apparently they're closed again today, which we didn't know. We've left voicemails and emails so we're hoping that someone might be able to come through for us. We're going to try Pets Come First later today, but they don't open until one. He's really cuddly, and wants to be near whoever is cleaning him/feeding him. We have a regular vet appointment today that we'd made before having to take him to emergency care. Some pics are below-- not sure what to do at this point since we haven't really been able to get solid answers from anyone, unfortunately. ~~On that note, if you or someone you know if looking for a kitten please shoot me a PM!~~

I emailed Penn State about it, and received this response earlier this morning:


---


The proposed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act contains several provisions that could impact graduate students at Penn State, including potentially taxing graduate tuition grants-in-aid, according to Sec. 1204. Repeal of Qualified Scholarships.  Current law enables graduate students to exclude funds received for scholarships, fellowships and grants from taxable income if funds are used to pay tuition and fees, among other items.  Repealing this provision will impact Penn State’s graduate assistants and graduate fellows.  Even considering the increase in the standard deduction, it is estimated that on average, graduate students and fellows at Penn State will have a $2,000 increase in their tax obligations as a result of repealing qualified scholarships, though individual students may be affected differently.  The University's Office of Government and Community Relations has staff dedicated to working with the federal government, who have communicated to key Members of Congress the impact these proposed changes would have, including on our graduate students, as priority issues.  The University will have additional opportunities to communicate as the legislative process continues.  

The University is part of several higher education associations and important advocacy groups including the American Council on Education (ACE) and the Association of American Universities (AAU), which have already released statements and detailed information on the proposed legislation.

· [ACE Letter on House Tax Cuts and Jobs Act](http://www.acenet.edu/news-room/Documents/Letter-on-House-Tax-Cuts-and-Jobs-Act.pdf)

· [ACE’s, ""Why is Tax Reform Important?""](http://www.acenet.edu/Pages/Higher-Education-and-Tax-Reform.aspx)

· [AAU Statement on the House Tax Reform Bill](https://www.aau.edu/newsroom/press-releases/aau-statement-house-tax-reform-bill)

Additionally, the Graduate and Professional Student Association (GPSA) has been in contact with University leaders and with the University’s Office of Government and Community Relations and expressed its commitment to working with the University in advocating on this issue.  We welcome this opportunity and believe we can be most effective by working together.  You can contact Matt Krott, GPSA President, who is also copied on this email, at krott@psu.edu for more information about how to get involved with the GPSA.  Students can also contact their Congressional representatives directly to express their opinions about the proposed legislation.

We are communicating this information directly to all graduate assistants and graduate fellows, and will share additional information on this evolving issue as it becomes available.

**tl;dr -** Graduate students (TAs and RAs) and fellows at Penn State are going to see between 8-12% of their income disappear starting on January 1st if this shit passes."

I kept trying and, at the end of the day, it wasn't worth putting in exorbitant amounts of effort and seeing no results. Physics was my deciding factor to switch. It was a decision that I took quite a while to decide because I had many of the same questions that essentially every student in this position has: Will I still be able to work as a software engineer? Will larger tech companies hire someone with an IST degree? What is the difference? 

Everyone will tell you that it will be difficult to get a CS related job with an IST degree (D&amp;D). I think they are correct to some extent, but also, they aren't completely correct either. If you haven't heard, the common acronym for IST stands for: ""I Stopped Trying"". I find this to be completely false. **IST is what you make of it.** If you sit in the classes, take the exams, and check off all the boxes in the recommended academic plan then, yes, you *will* have a difficult time finding a job that you enjoy because you will have fulfilled the legacy of the acronym, i.e. stopped trying.

However, I view it in a much different sense and I have one professor in particular to thank because he completely changed my viewpoint on the IST curriculum. Instead of the acronym meaning ""I Stopped Trying"", what if it means, ""I'm Self Taught""? Sit down and really think about what that new acronym means to **you**. Like I said before and I'll say it again, IST is what *you* make of it. If you choose to stop trying, well, that's on you. If you choose to understand that IST *doesn't* offer some of the logical, mathematics, and coding courses that CS does and instead you focus on *teaching* yourself those skills outside of the classroom, then you make yourself a worthy candidate for employers.

IST is not as technical as CS; I’ve heard it describes as “a mile wide and an inch deep”. On the other hand, I’ve heard that CS is “an inch wide and a mile deep”. Honestly, neither of the two sound attractive to me because the degree is either too specific or too broad. This is where I think IST yields more benefits than CS. Interpret the words above literally; I’m sort of a math person so I’ll use math to portray what I’m trying to say. When I hear, “a mile wide and an inch deep”, I think of a large circle, a mile in diameter, dug out in inch deep. Think of how large that is. Let’s calculate the surface area of this shallow, mile-wide circle. The equation for surface area of a circle is (pi)r^2. We have all the variables so plug them in and you get something along the lines of 2.19 * 10^7 square feet. Now do the same with the other saying, “an inch wide and a mile deep”, and you’ll get .0054 square feet. Which is larger?

What I’m trying to say is that in IST, there are more areas to find a niche that *you* fit into. Given that huge circular mile, you’re free to pick and choose what smaller holes you dig and where you dig them. Holes, in this metaphor, being specific areas of interest or focuses of the major. Let’s say you start digging a hole and you realize it’s not what you thought or you realize you don’t like it; you can stop digging at anytime and start a new hole. IST allows you the freedom to do what you want with your education with very minimal limitations. CS doesn’t really give you that luxury; you’re pretty much stuck in the little tunnel Penn State forces you down. Once you dig that initial hole, you’re committed; there isn’t much room for specificity or areas of interest. I’m not saying that if you’re in CS or continue with it you won’t find what appeals to you. What I am saying is that it will be slightly more difficult because the classes you will take at Penn State will shape you to be the engineer that Penn State *wants* you to be. 

I don’t view my degree in IST any less than an engineering degree and here’s why. Not only am I currently an undergraduate student at Penn State, I’m also technically considered an employee. I started working on research projects shortly after I arrived here. I have done multiple projects in a variety of field, but do you want to know something? Every single project has related to my coursework in some form or another. This has been extremely beneficial to me because it not only helps to solidify the material learned in class, but it forces me to apply what I’ve learned in a real world application; this is *exactly* what employers want to see. To further elaborate on why I value my IST degree and experiences so much, I’ll provide a few personal examples.

**I’ll just say this now, my intention is not to sound arrogant or self absorbed, but to provide some insight into the opportunities that I have found within the college.**

My research position has really stood out to employers and it has even landed me a few interviews with both small and large companies. I recently received an internship to be a software engineering intern this summer for a defense contractor. The reason being is that a portion of kids in the IST program just slide through the program without putting much thought or work into their degree and employers see this. However, when an IST student with drive and a passion for learning comes along, employers are surprised and don’t feel the need for hesitation because they see the initiative the student has taken to expand their knowledge. This shows employers that the student is willing to take on challenges. 

I have heard so many people beat and bash D&amp;D, and all of IST for that matter, for not being held to the same standards as CS but what people need to understand is that they are two *completely* different areas of studies that receive two *completely* different degrees. I’ll be honest, and people who have said this before got a lot of flak for it, if you come out of the IST curriculum without a job, **you** put yourself there; the curriculum didn’t fail you, you failed yourself. I have met with so many bright, able minded people in the College of IST who are able get jobs in larger companies. CS does not “open more doors”. Yes, it opens a slightly different set of doors than IST does but there are still plenty of them open. For students who really want the ability to do extra projects on the side and get more application experience, then IST is probably better. Before I switched from CS to D&amp;D I found it extremely difficult to balance my life between my school work, research, personal projects, and friends. Currently, I’m able to balance all of those things and I have a better state of mind. 

That being said, if you switch, you need to understand that IST is not as technical. You need to understand that you will need to be self motivated to learn more about data structures and algorithms, logical and computational things, and higher level math if you want to work in a computer science related field. You can tailor your D&amp;D degree however you’d like. That’s why I’m currently branching out and learning some of the quintessential classes that are taught in CS on my own time. It relieves the pressure of having to do work for a grade and I can spend more time focusing on actually learning the material. 

One of the common questions or rebuttals I get quite often goes something like this, “How do you find the time and motivation to learn what you don’t know?” There is a very simple answer to this, you find what motivates you and then you make time. I’ll quote Elon Musk because he provides an absolutely brilliant viewpoint, “If you need inspiring words, don’t do it”. If you truly want to learn and expand your knowledge, you shouldn’t need someone guiding you along the way, telling you how to do something. Someone else shouldn’t be the crutch that keeps you standing and pursuing your goal, but more so the inspiration for your future endeavors. Learn to be resilient and self reliant; look to yourself for motivation, not others. If it’s something that you truly enjoy doing, you’ll find a way. It may take a while, but you'll find a way.

I'm personally motivated by the research I do. I work with Masters and PhD students who rely on me for essential parts of their projects regarding their theses. They depend on me to be able to do produce a certain result at the end of the project or term. When people depend on me or when I have a responsibility, it puts more pressure on me to work towards and finish the task at hand.

It is very similar to an internship or job. I get to work with mentors, graduate students, on projects that push the boundaries of my knowledge and understanding. If I don't know how to do something, it's up to me to speak up and ask for help. For my current project, I have to design and implement a game that uses mobile client-server architecture. I’m not an expert on that; I’ve never even done what I was asked to complete. However, I made it very clear from the day I joined the team that it will take me a while to develop these skills but I will eventually get there.

The usual response to my view on self motivation is, “Well isn’t that really difficult?” Of course it's difficult. It's difficult because you're exploring and learning on your own. I don't know how many people went to a public school but I'll say this anyway. The problem with public schools is that they have shifted their teaching models to make kids become dependent on validation. Any time they are told to do something, they need the reassurance that they are doing the task correctly because they don't want to get points off/ a bad grade. Students aren't taught to ask engaging questions that will help further their knowledge and connect the dots. They'd rather be taught the process in which the assignment is done in order to get the correct answer and the most amount of points. This is **not** how independent learning, research, or personal projects are done. I went to a public school and had that exact problem I just described. I was too afraid to take risks and let myself screw up. 

I'll tell you something that happened to me. At one point last year I pissed off my research professor because I kept asking for self validation and he said, ""Seriously, just sit down, think about it, and then do something. Who cares if you mess up, there is nothing you can do with regards to this project that cannot be undone or fixed"". So I went and did exactly that. In the process, I screwed the thing up that I was attempting to do. When I went to correct my mistake I actually *learned* something; I learned exactly what it was that I was trying to do and I understood what I needed to do for next time. Did it delay my progress on the project? Yes. Did something terrible happen in the process? No. Did I learn something of value? Absolutely. There were times where I would spend hours, days, hell, even weeks, working on a problem and make absolutely no progress, but that’s okay because I learned something in the end. 

The majority of the things you will do in your lifetime will be difficult. If they aren’t, then you’re not learning, growing, and expanding as a human being. I understand that doing new things or making big decisions is scary and challenging, but you have to learn to embrace challenge for it will make you a better, stronger individual. What’s the worst that could happen? How do you make the best out of the worst? Answering those two questions honestly, will show the kind of motivation you have.

I have talked to hundreds of employers and they all say virtually the same thing, “if you have the skills we are looking for, you’ll get the internship/job”. **Your degree does not define what you do.** This is a really tough thing to comprehend when all your teachers and counselors in high school told you that your degree means everything. It doesn’t matter what that stupid piece of paper you get at graduation says you majored in, if you have the skills, you’re qualified for the job. If you don’t, make it a goal of yours to try to learn and apply those skills.

IST is a more practical application of software in industry. In CS they have you thinking in a very theoretical way in order for you to learn how to solve complex problems. I’m not sure that is something everyone wants to do, but I know I didn’t want to do that. I have taught myself a decent amount of theory and whether it was through projects or reading, doesn’t matter because I’ve learned it. IST bridges the gap between the people who can sit down and code for 12+ hours and the people who can think of an interface’s design but can't code it. **If you think an IST degree limits your abilities than I’m sorry to tell you, but you are limiting your own abilities.**

I understand that the decision to switch out of the College of Engineering is pretty daunting, I thought about it for weeks before I finally made the decision. However, I’ll give you a bit of advice no one ever gave me, you need to learn to accept failure. In addition to failure, you need to understand how to live with the consequences of your decisions and learn how to make the best of the current situation. I’m going to be honest, failure sucks, no one wants to fail, no one *likes* failing, but it’s a part of life; you win some, you lose some. Throughout high school I was a “winner”, everything went right for me. I was a 4.0 honors student involved in many clubs and extracurricular activities. I thought college was going to be a breeze. Then reality, mainly failure, set in. When you go from a 4.0 student to failing pretty much every single class you’ve taken that semester, it really makes you reevaluate your life's decisions. I was forced to step down off my high horse and look failure right in the face. That was, and probably will be, the absolute hardest part of college: learning how to accept defeat and failure. However, failure isn’t all bad. It is one of the richest and purest forms of learning, adapting, and changing. This is the point where you learn how to rebound, think about what you did wrong and how you got in the current position. How you rebound from that failure is what people will see, admire, and remember. As long as you walk away a better person, that’s what people will remember. 

That’s my two cents, take it however, you will. I’m not going to tell you what you should do because you’re all adults now and you have to figure things out for yourselves. Part of being an adult is taking chances and not being afraid to fail; and trust me, you’ll fail. But more importantly, you learn how to come back from a failure as a better person. I’ll quote Jill Biden from her seminar in the fall semester, “You have to find what your passion is and then go for it. Only you can find it and when you do, only you will be able to understand the true feeling of passion. You have to feel it”. I can tell you that switching was the right choice for me. Before I switched, I was spending all my time studying and trying to keep up with the material. I was miserable and depressed because I didn’t have a social life; my freshman year sucked, I completely wasted it doing work. Ever since switching, I’ve been a much happier and joyful person. 

I hoped this helped, but seriously think about and consider what I said. I didn’t write it for my health, I wrote it because I was in your shoes not that long ago and I understand that it’s scary. If you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to ask; questions are how we learn. 

Good luck my friends

I learned that other people had received this email too, and I wanted to warn people before they use the app:

The app requires notifications and locations permission, it asks you to provide your full name, and to verify your psu email. Once you sign up a message says “absolutely no objectionable content” allowed. From what I saw, the message boards are heavily moderated in order to prepare the app for being advertiser-friendly. This actually means there is very little organic content generated and it’s highly exploitative in favor of the app creators. The curated posts are offensively bland and they use :( a lot, in case you didn’t get that they disapprove of something, which you definitely will.

Of course this is all my perspective (and maybe I am not the best person for this, given that I’ve mentioned other apps), but the way that this was solicited to us en masse through our university emails is at least cause for concern."

Penn State Campus Recreation conducted a review of all of it's club sports and decided that the activities that PSOC engages in are too risky for it to fall under Campus Rec. Penn State Student Affairs also conducted a review and found that the club ""exceeds the acceptable risk threshold"" for any other type of student organization. Therefore, PSOC can't go play outside anymore.

For 98 years, the club has fostered a community at Penn State for outdoorsy folks to meet, plan trips, host guest speakers, teach outdoors skills and leadership.  They've also played a role in local conservation efforts, trail maintenance, and creation of several local events and outdoor recreation sites. PSOC and it's members played a large role in creating the Mid\-State Trail, Allegheny Front Trail, and trails in Quehanna Wild Area. Now, they aren't even sure if they can still remain a club just to talk about hiking trips their members went on over the weekend.

The absurdity and hypocrisy of this decision is not lost on me. Looking at what Penn State allows for other student orgs on campus \(..ahem, I'm looking at you, Frats &amp; Sororities...\) and even university\-sponsored sports, yet they draw a line with students going hiking in Rothrock?

If you're a member or alumni of a student club on campus, you should be VERY concerned about what this may mean for the organizations that are important to you in the future. Caving Club and Scuba Club were also told they can no longer do trips, and likely have to shut down.

\(bold emphasis mine\)

UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — Campus Recreation, a unit of Penn State Student Affairs, is taking steps to increase safety in student clubs, while remaining true to its strong support of outdoor recreation and leadership development opportunities for students. Providing access to these experiences has long been part of its mission through the Outdoor Adventures program.

In spring 2018, a review of all 79 Campus Recreation\-supported student organizations was conducted. After the evaluation, Campus Recreation, the Office of Student Activities and Penn State Office of Risk Management recommended a variety of changes to 20 current registered student organizations. Three outdoor\-based clubs — Penn State Outing Club, Nittany Grotto and Nittany Diving — were determined to have an unacceptable level of risk in their current operation model. To see what was considered in the evaluation, and for answers to other questions, visit [our FAQs page](http://www.psu.edu/ur/newsdocuments/FAQs_Campus_Rec.pdf).

“We know there is an inherent risk associated with any activity,” said Laura Hall, senior director of Campus Recreation. “Through our evaluation, we worked to determine, from a University standpoint, what the acceptable levels of risk are for the student organizations within our program. The goal was not to eliminate all risk, but to responsibly manage risk so that our students can continue to safely participate in a variety of recreation activities. Penn State supports providing as many opportunities in the outdoors as possible, while also remaining committed to student safety and well\-being.”

After learning the outcome of the evaluation, student leaders expressed an interest in changing their club models in order to remain recognized student organizations. The Penn State Outing Club and the Nittany Divers submitted proposals to the University outlining their plans. These outdoor clubs will remain recognized student organizations and are working with staff in Student Affairs to restructure so they can continue to foster a community for students around outdoor recreation. University staff also have reached out to the third club — Nittany Grotto — to see if its members would like to remain connected to Penn State as a registered student organization.

Both the Outing Club and Nittany Divers will continue to foster communities around diving and outdoor recreation through activities such as hosting speakers, educational programs, film screenings and festivals; participating in philanthropic and charitable causes around marine life, dive safety and local environmental conservation efforts; providing information about campus and local resources; and raising awareness of the importance of spending time outdoors for mental and physical health.

**Due to safety concerns and the need for more oversight, these clubs can no longer lead organized trips.** **However, Campus Recreation’s Outdoor Adventure program will continue to offer student\-led trips and experiences** and is working closely with club members to ensure they are providing a range of activities for all experience levels. Student staff within the Outdoor Adventure program receive yearlong training in safety, risk management and leadership to enable them to lead outdoor activities with safety and student welfare in mind.

The Nittany Divers club leaders have maintained a positive attitude about these changes and have readily collaborated with Campus Recreation staff to develop SCUBA diving experiences for all students, regardless of experience level. Nittany Divers released a statement describing the new relationship with the University and encouraging students to take advantage of the trips and programs offered through Campus Recreation’s Outdoor Adventures. Likewise, with the leadership shown thus far by student leaders of the Outing Club, Hall said the University is confident that the shared goals around outdoor recreation will be achieved for generations of Penn State students to come.

Vice President for Student Affairs Damon Sims indicated he has been asked by a number of students for an opportunity to meet and discuss the significant role that outdoor activities play on a college campus and determine how Penn State can assist them in advocating for this important aspect of student life. Sims said he would be setting up a meeting for this purpose in early summer.

“As we do what's required to improve safety considerations in our students' outdoor activities, we also must do what we must to sustain the commitment these students have to the outdoors and their advocacy for related interests,” Sims said. “I've not been directly involved in our discussions with these students, but I'd like to be soon, and I'm eager to learn more about how I can help them through this transition.""

In the coming year, **Outdoor Adventures will provide 194 unique opportunities for Penn State students to engage in outdoor recreation activities, including rafting, hiking, backpacking, caving, SCUBA diving, paddling, rock climbing, ice\-climbing, mountain biking, and more.** These experiences range from low\-cost or free activities for beginners, such as Mt. Nittany hikes, beginner kayaking, and try SCUBA clinics, to day trips, weekend trips and skill clinics at higher rates. Trips are primarily student\-led by highly trained student leaders. The Outdoor Adventures staff develops trip ideas in collaboration with students and regularly adds new opportunities.

For students who want to explore the outdoors on their own, Outdoor Adventures offers equipment rentals, guidebooks, maps and other resources. Students can visit the Outdoor Adventures office in the IM Building on campus during office hours to borrow free resources or rent equipment."

1) [**Paterno**](https://www.amazon.com/Paterno-Joe-Posnanski/dp/1451657498/ref=pd_sim_14_3?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=1451657498&amp;pd_rd_r=T9D410GV12V7G5VDBFH4&amp;pd_rd_w=1Hsc3&amp;pd_rd_wg=Pdo6v&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=T9D410GV12V7G5VDBFH4) by Joe Posnanski (2012)

This is the book that served as the foundation for the original screenplay.  In addition to being a biography on Paterno’s life, it provides context to factors surrounding the scandal including:

* The late coach’s professional and personal relationship dynamic with Sandusky
* Some of the family and friends’ dialogue in the initial fallout
* Perspectives of family and friends regarding what happened and their perceptions regarding the overall case and perceptions of the Freeh Report

Here are some [cliffnotes from Deadspin](https://deadspin.com/5936084/the-six-things-you-should-know-about-joe-posnanskis-paterno-book)

2) [**Silent No More: Victim 1's Fight for Justice Against Jerry Sandusky**] (https://www.amazon.com/Silent-No-More-Justice-Sandusky/dp/0345544161/ref=pd_sbs_14_8?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=0345544161&amp;pd_rd_r=SW9VFRJ3DF144VC0PA1E&amp;pd_rd_w=YpLsL&amp;pd_rd_wg=xzqLc&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=SW9VFRJ3DF144VC0PA1E) by Aaron Fisher (2012)

This was the book written by Victim 1 (Aaron Fisher) along with his therapist‎ (Michael Gillum) and mother‎ (Dawn Daniels).  It provides his firsthand account of abuse by Sandusky and the process he underwent to get his case to move forward with law enforcement and the eventual arrest of Sandusky.

3) [**Paterno Legacy: Enduring Lessons from the Life and Death of My Father**](https://www.amazon.com/Paterno-Legacy-Enduring-Lessons-Father/dp/1600789749) by Jay Paterno (2014)

This book is a son’s perspective of his father and offers a unique inside perspective surrounding the scandal, its fallout, and aftermath.  This includes:

* Discussions with his father

* The PR process of defending his father and TV appearances to offer the family’s perspective

* Messages he has received (positive and negative) from people since then

Overall, it serves as a better supporting piece to Posnanski’s work than a stand alone book.

4) [**The Paterno Family-Commissioned Reports**](http://paterno.com/Default.aspx)

The Paterno Report is a collection of reports that analyzed and criticized the Freeh Report The reports from multiple sources:

* *Wick Soller*: The family’s legal representation during the scandal

* *Dick Thornburgh*: Former Attorney General and Governor of Pennsylvania

* *Jim Clemente*: Former Supervisory Special Agent in the Behavioral Analysis Unit, FBI Consultant

* *Dr. Fred Berlin*: Johns Hopkins University Professor, founder of The Johns Hopkins Sexual Disorders Clinic, and Director of the National Institute for the Study, Prevention and Treatment of Sexual Trauma

As of now, the most popular of the reports, among Paterno loyalists and child advocate groups alike, has been Clemente’s report because of his field experience in dealing with child predators and how some acquire trust of local communities by becoming “Pillars of the Community”.  In the scandal’s case, he is referring to Sandusky’s charity work through his non-profit, The Second Mile, to help at-risk youth.

5) Amir Bar Lev’s [**Happy Valley**](https://www.netflix.com/title/70299907) Documentary (2014)

This documentary, now available on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/70299907), covers the Penn State/State College Community in the fallout of the scandal.  It provides interviews with the Paterno family, locals, and Matthew Sandusky, Sandusky’s adopted son.  While the documentary has flaws, it provides a relatively comprehensive view of the overall scandal.

Example: The focus on Paterno’s mural halo as a form of hagiography was a taken out of context. Halos are placed over every individual who has passed away; there was even one for a dead dog.  For more information on the mural halos, the [artist did a TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bVhrpkp0WU) and discusses this point specifically (~14:47).

They were removed all removed after the Freeh Report, but [later reinstalled in 2016](https://onwardstate.com/2016/01/05/pilato-paints-back-halos-to-inspiration-mural/) with an explanation of their intent.

6) [**Undaunted: Breaking My Silence to Overcome the Trauma of Child Sexual Abuse**](https://www.amazon.com/Undaunted-Breaking-Silence-Overcome-Trauma/dp/1941519873) (2015)

This covers Matt Sandusky’s history, adoption, grooming, and abuse by Sandusky.  He also discusses his perspective of the scandal, the university and how predators operate.  His book was also recommended by Jim Clemente.  He has since started a non-profit, [Peaceful Hearts Foundation](http://www.peacefulheartsfoundation.org/), and has even done an [AMA on Reddit]( https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6alnbg/were_matt_sandusky_gary_greenburg_and_nikki/).

There is plenty of other works written on the scandal (new articles, etc), but I felt these sources were particularly worth sharing because of their unique perspectives and how close they were to the case.

I’m an incoming freshman in the College of Liberal arts and am attending the LEAP program this summer, which is when it’s been happening.
What is D&amp;D? It’s a collaborative choose your own adventure, you and your ‘party’ members undertake quests in a role-played setting. You don’t need to know everything or anything but if you like fantasy, sci-fi or creative fiction, you might like the chance to be a protagonist of the story. I will likely act as the Dungeon/Game Master, and create the world for you all to explore.

As far as the actual administration of the exam will go I will show my Real ID, use my real ID number so I don't think there is any code of conduct violation going on and there will be no one in the moment telling me I can't do this.
 
Next what will happen to the grade? will I receive a report from the test center, will I get emailed about why and how I took this test from the coordinator, will I get academically sanctioned or will it be like nothing happened?

I'm just honestly curious If I took a final for a future class or pass class, or class I drop just for fun.
Idk if there are any teaching personnel who know what happens or people who can show where this is in the code."

Yes friends, I drove up to Happy Valley for really no reason at all...for the first time back in nine years going on **10** soon.The nostalgia draw was too strong and I had been thinking about it for a while. I had planned on just sleeping in the back of my wagon if there weren't any other options; I ended up doing this in the HUB parking deck. I was up all night for the most part, had a bunch of drinks in town, talked to some people. It's amazing how much time has gone by and how much has changed in the little town. I couldn't stop walking around and looking at everything, on and off campus. Remembering all the places I had classes, all the places where struggles challenged me the most...all the places where very happy memories were made. The hardest part of it all? Leaving. The weight in my chest that increased every mile further I was away from State College. I wish I could wind the clock back and do it all over again.

Let this be some words of wisdom to all you youngsters (oh God did I really just say 'youngsters'?): Take what you have now and experience it to the fullest. Go out, make friends, go to football games. Don't do what I did and waste time in a dorm room playing games. These are absolutely the best years of your life. And Penn State is *magical* and you'll remember it and go back to it for years to come."

&amp;#x200B;

# &lt;a name=""general""&gt;&lt;/a&gt; General questions:

&amp;#x200B;

**Q: Should I study for ALEKS math exam?**

A: Probably not. ALEKS math exam is there purely to put you in appropriate level math class. I.e if you score high, you get placed in Math 140 or something (calculus 1). So I mean, don't fret out too much. If you do bad, just mean you start at a lower level math class, but can be good for your grade since it probably easy A, and refresh your memory/prep you for calculus.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q: I'm struggling in my classes, what can I do?**

A: Generally: Go to office hours for help, try to read the textbook before class to get a general sense of the materials, so at the very least you see the material twice (once in the textbook, once in the lecture). Get a tutor, as a PSU student you have access to free tutoring through the university (well technically not free since it's paid already through your tuition). Also something i find really helpful is to actively listen instead of just jotting down notes. Most of the time professors teach their lectures from the textbook or slides anyway, no need to write down notes, just use the textbook or the slides. I would rather actively listening than write notes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q: Welp, I'm probably gong to fail this class. What should I do?**

A: If you think there's nothing you can do (after talking to your professor and everything), you probably should drop it. There's no shame in dropping a class, although keep in mind that it will show up on your transcript as a LD, but your GPA won't be affected. Now, do keep in mind that a. if you are on financial aids, if late drop put you below full time student status, your aid might be affected, and b. you can only retake a class 2 times, so, pick your battle wisely.

# &lt;a name=""housing""&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Housing Questions:

&amp;#x200B;

**Q: On-campus or off-campus for housing?**

A: Again, really depend on what you want. On-campus housing is definitely more expensive, requiring you to get a meal plan, but it can be very convenient if you want to attend events around the campus. Off-campus is cheaper, usually come with kitchen and your own bathroom, so I think it mostly depend on what you want.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q: Which on-campus housing complex should I pick?**

A: The general consensus seem to be AVOID POLLOCK. But otherwise, seem like it really depend on your majors and preference. If you are in an engineering major, West is probably best since it's close to a lot of engineering classes. North for businesses, South for access to downtown/hub.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q: I'm a freshie! I'm so excited to live on my own apartment somewhere downtown.**

A: Suck to be you, all freshmen are required to live on campus. Also not a question, but it good to know

&amp;#x200B;

**Q: I'm currently living off campus, can I move to on-campus?**

A: If you are lucky, yes, it's a lottery system. If you get lucky and get pick, then you can.

&amp;#x200B;

# &lt;a name=""branch""&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Branch campuses questions:

&amp;#x200B;

**Q: Are branch campuses easier/harder/not as prestigious/different school?**

A: Whether you find branch campuses easier/harder is really depend on the person, and it is also depend on the professors. I know plenty of people who found UP to be such a step up and that their branch campuses classes were a joke, but I myself found UP to be easier than my branch campus (LV). All branch campuses degrees are still Penn State degree regardless, and even if you spend all 4 years at Branch, you can still list on your resume as ""Pennsylvania State University"" without listing the branch.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q: Are you guaranteed to transfer to UP?**

A: Generally yes, there are some specific situation like trying to change your major after you transfered (from another university/community college) to a branch campus where UP won't allow you to come if you start at a different major, but usually yes. As long as you finish your ETM/and take classes at reasonable pace that match with 2+2 options, you definitely can go to UP.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q: I have some personal reason I need to go to UP, even before I finish my 2 years at a branch/I need to go to UP later. Can I do that?**

A: Generally, yes, as long as you can provide a reasonable reason (usually a. branch campus don't provide specific class, or only offer it at specific semester, so if you stay at branch to take that class at that specific semester it might make you behind your schedule, financial complication (you transfered with 1 semester worth of credit,  so you only need to stay at branch for 1.5 years, but your apartment only offer year long lease, so if you stay there for half a year it would be a lot more expensive and become a financial burden). No matter what you do, when you go onto LionPATH to change campus, you have to provide a reason/get it approved (even if you finished the 2 years at branch, you still have to say something like ""Finished requirement for 2+2 at branch"" and wait for it to get manually approved).

&amp;#x200B;

**Q: Any advantage/disadvantage to going to a branch over UP?**

A: Yes and no, it really depend on what you want. At branch campuses classes are definitely a lot smaller, I think the biggest class I had at branch was about 60 person. I also find it a lot easier to make connection with professors and some of my most favorite professors have been from branch campuses. Another thing is tuition price, going to branch on average save you about 6k per semester (i.e if branch tuition is 6k, UP is 12k). Branch campuses does lack when it come to social/involvement event though, since there are less student i.e less club i.e less events going around.

&amp;#x200B;

# &lt;a name=""major""&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Majors related questions:

&amp;#x200B;

**Q: My GPA is not high enough/ I missed my credit window, can I still get into my major?**

A: There is no definitive answer on this, whether you can get in or not is based on a case by case basis, talk to your advisor. Some was able to get in, some was not.

LPT: You can conditionally enter your majors, just ask your advisor. For some reasons I didn't get into Math230 on time, and it was the only class left in my ETM, and by the time I finish the class I would have more credit than the required credit window for Cmpsc. I asked my Cmpsc advisor and he allowed me to enter the major conditionally while I'm still in the credit window, and as long as I do well in my Math 230 class, I can stay in Cmpsc (if I fail I would get move out of Math 230 ofc).

&amp;#x200B;

**Q: Can I double major in X and Y?**

A: If both X and Y are controlled majors, no, BUT there are exception, refer to department website for specific list, such as ([https://advising.engr.psu.edu/student-resources/multiple-majors.aspx](https://advising.engr.psu.edu/student-resources/multiple-majors.aspx)).

If X is controlled and Y is not, yes, but make sure you enter X first.

If neither is controlled, go ahead!

&amp;#x200B;

**Q: What's my chance to get into X? Should I apply as DUS?**

A: No one here can really say with 100% confident whether you will get into X, and while there are no official statistic on whether DUS are more than likely to get in, the general consensus seem to be if you get rejected to say, CS or something, you can apply as DUS, then change your major after you study there for a semester or something. \*BIG OMEGA NOTE\*: I don't know about DUS specifically, BUT for transfer student admitted to BRANCH CAMPUS, if you plan to change your major into one that is controlled AND end at University Park, DOUBLE CHECK WITH A UNIVERSITY PARK ADVISOR. I have a friend who started Data Science at Abington who can't change his major into Pre-Engr/Cmpsc and go to UP because the College of Engineering don't allow that.

&amp;#x200B;

Moral of the story is, when in doubt, ALWAYS double check with the advisors SPECIFICALLY AT THE CAMPUS YOU PLAN TO GO TO (i.e if you start at Lehigh Valley and end at UP, make sure to ask advisor at UP too). For a list of advisors, well, google it. There are always informations about PSU advisors online, but, here are some for references, let me know if I miss any:

# &lt;a name=""food""&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Foodie related question:

&amp;#x200B;

**Q: Should I get meal plan? Is it worth it?**

A: Short answer: Hell no. Long answer: Really depend, but probably not. There have been a lot of discussion regarding whether meal plans are worth it or not, and the general consensus seem to be that it isn't worth it. The meal plan don't make the food at dining commons free, you still have to pay to eat at dining common even with the meal plan, albeit at a discount rate. I believe someone did the math and found out that you have to eat a lot of dining common to make up for the initial meal plan payment (i.e eat there practically every meal or so). If you really want to eat at dining common, getting the commuter plan is probably your best bet.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q: How's the dining common experience?**

A: Generally pretty good, keep in mind that they are almost always understaffed because basically the entire cook/server team is student-employed, and I think not a lot of students want to work in dining common. I personally never had any problems at dining common, but yeah. This also mean that if you are desperate for income, you are basically guaranteed a job at dining common if you apply.  


**Q: Best food place evar?**

A: Big bowl

...

No really, big bowl is great

...

Fine, I'm biased, but it's kinda hard to get a good answers since it's subjective. I personally love Big Bowl as far as Chinese food goes, but other contender would be Little Food Court. For Japanese food there are Tadashi. Korean: There are Kimchi Korean if you are willing to go far/can drive, or Waker for Korean Fried Chicken. For Vietnamese food there's Pho 11, although as a Vietnamese person, I think the place is alright, it is definitely not authentic/catered more toward Chinese/White people taste. Please send me a dm with your favorite food suggestions and I will include it here.

&amp;#x200B;

**Q: What's the different between the two Tadashi?**

A: The one infront of Hammond Building serve ramen, the other one serve Udon and some other stuff (but no ramen). I.e they have different menus.

* Never been to a football game. I know.
* Never really attended a bona fide frat party but I don't feel like it's worth it at this point? I'm almost 22 for God's sake 
* Big fan of the outdoors, yes I've done Mt Nittany and Rothrock/Millbrook/Bald Eagle/BlackMo but never been a part of an Adventure Rec activity
* I have access to a car
* No interest in THON. Sorry.
* Things I really wanted to try as a freshman were gliding club and boxing, but I don't have a ton of money and I don't think I could keep up with the boxing schedule.
* Big fan of video games, movies, playing and listening to music, photography, art

I'm not sure if that's enough, but I just need help. I won't know what I'll miss most about this university until I leave. :/ Any ideas welcome!"

I have tons of acquaintances, but no good friends to actually hang out with, and I would like to try and change that this upcoming fall. The hard thing is that I feel like everyone sort of has their cliques and are less likely to be open to meeting new people.

I’m looking to join a new club or two that is great in terms of meeting new people and making new friends. I would love to meet just a couple people to go to bars with sometimes or grab lunch and just hang out, or go to the football games with.

Anyway, I have joined clubs in the past, but I feel like they are the types of clubs where you are expected to “join with a friend”, and everyone just does the activities with their said friends and no one is really willing to become better friends with the new people that join the clubs. Or all the upperclassmen are already so close in the club that it’s hard to make your way into the friendships.

I’m looking for a club that will take up a lot of my time so I have the opportunity to regularly be with these people to get to know them, and also a club that will regularly host socials... But I mainly just want to be with friendly, open, and welcoming people that are fun to get to know. Also I’m not interested in joining a sorority or frat. Any advice is greatly appreciated!"

I am tired of shitty professors ruining my mood with crazy complicated projects and random academic integrity strikes, CS is taking a toll on my mental health, I am done.

Now, I have finished most of my geneds except maybe one GH course, I have finished 75% of my CMPSC courses and I finished some general courses like English 202 and CAS 100. Can people tell me what IST is like? I really don't want to do much coding anymore and I feel like I have a PTSD for code now, there are a lot of options in IST but I don't know which one to choose.

Also, I know it is really really late to change majors now, how many years do you expect to finish an IST major? What about the difficulty of the IST courses? Do you guys think if it's possible that I can take multiple IST courses concurrently in one semester?

I know I am asking a lot of questions here but you honestly seem like you know your shit. I am really afraid and nervous but I am determined to make the switch, CS makes me miserable and I want everything switched and done before next semester starts, I have scheduled a phone meeting with one of the IST advisors on Monday but I would like to absorb as much information as I can before that.

TL;DR Questions:
1. What's the difference between all the IST branches?

2. What's the difficulty like for IST courses?

3. I finished my junior year of CS courses, how do I make the switch into IST and how long do you guys think I need?"

If you want to read the whole 44 page thing yourself go [here](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/15944879/john-doe-v-the-pennsylvania-state-university/) and scroll down to number 11 (""Brief in opposition"").

There's a whole bunch of other filings, but they mostly seem to be about logistics of the case. 11 is the interesting one.

It is the University's argument against a preliminary injunction (basically where the court issues an order to give him part of the relief he asks for. In this case so that the second hearing is canceled or pushed back). From my quick skim it seems to boil down to the following:

1. Doe can't prove there was irreparable harm, as his appeal was granted, and he ""might be found not responsible"", and that any harm already felt was self imposed because, ""Doe voluntarily chose not to enroll in classes for the spring 2019 semester""
2. Doe does not have ""a likelihood of success on the merits,"" which you need for a preliminary injunction. In this they go into what would likely be their primary arguments should this thing go to trial. These are:
   1. ""Doe was afforded all process required by the law and the Code""
   2. ""The role of courts is not to retry, de novo, disciplinary charges against students,"" rather to ""ask whether those procedures deserve a blow from the heavy hammer of the United States Constitution.”  
   3. ""All that due process requires is 'notice of the charges they \[the respondent\] face and the nature of the evidence supporting those charges.'""  and that ""Doe here had abundant notice of the charges he faced, and multiple opportunities to discuss and review the evidence supporting those charges""
   4. "" The notion that Roe talking to the Panel was somehow “new information” is absurd, and falls woefully short of stating any due process violation.""
   5. Had the University not granted Doe's appeal, there may have been a due process violation, but ""he suffered no prejudice—his appeal was granted""
   6. The document where the definition of coercion was changed to include cajoling ""may actually help Doe.""
   7. In response to his claims about gender discrimination. They say Doe has ""No explanation of how gender allegedly impacted anything,"" and, ""makes no credible argument regarding selective enforcement in violation of Title IX.""
3. ""Granting the preliminary injunction will result in greater harm to the University and its students than to Doe,"" as, ""every time a disciplined student is unhappy with the outcome of an internal, administrative student conduct process, he or she will run to Court.""
4. ""Doe wants to stop a new hearing that is intended to rectify concerns about his prior hearing""; ""the public’s interest and the University’s interest is in enforcing student discipline, to everyone’s benefit.""

This was filed on the 21st, and the new hearing was scheduled for the 23rd, but on the 23rd Andrew Shubin (Doe's attorney) filed a letter informing the court that the parties ""reached an agreement to reschedule the disciplinary hearing previously listed for today. No new date has been set for the hearing."" We of course don't know what was discussed in that meeting, but it seems to me the university may have granted some of Doe's requests in his motion for Preliminary Injuction so that he withdraws it. Should he, it would not mean the case was dropped, only that specific motion.

There seem to have been no new filings since then."

if you are a first time donor you get $300 spread through-out your first 5 donations. $50, $60, $50, $60, and lastly $80. After that it jumps to the typical $20 for your first donation of the calendar week, and $50 for your second donation (Mon-Sat, with one day in between donations at least. You couldn't donate saturday and then think donating monday would be a $50 donation. I do want to stress that you can only donate two times within a 7 day period. If you donate on Tuesdays and Thursdays you're pretty much stuck on those days, unless you do later in the week or skip a day. That always messes me and everyone else up.) 

There's usually new promos every month. Sometimes good, sometimes not so good (this month is $15 extra on your 7th donation and $35 extra on your 8th. but it'd be too late in the month for new donors to achieve that.) You get coupons, too. It's not anything amazing like ""you get a free $300 this donation"" or anything, but $10 extra here... $15 extra there... Even with no promos or coupons, $70 just for plasma is pretty big. Plasma saves lives. I heard workers saying the plasma gets turned into medications for things like hemophilia and immunodeficiency disorders.

All for just... an hour of your time. The first visit might take 2.5-ish hours because they have to enter you into the system and you need to do a medical questionnaire that takes a long time to make sure you can donate. but after the first visit it gets significantly shorter. The shortest time I've donated in was 38 minutes, but the longest was probably around 50 minutes. Dehydration and a bad stick.) 

They keep the saline room temperature and it's freezing in the building, so the last 5 minutes are unbearably cold. but you are allowed to bring a fuzzy blanket. All in all, you get a couple of extra bucks for 40 minutes of your time, just to wrap yourself in a comfy blanket and watch netflix on your laptop (free wifi.) Some phlebotomists aren't very good. If you have a bad experience, it was probably just who you got.

The biolife website tells you all what you'd need to do before your first visit. Eat right before going in, something hearty or you'll get sent to go eat by the receptionist... then you need your physical social security card (or they let me do a w-2. they do not accept pictures), a photo I.D of sorts, and proof of local address (lease agreement, piece of mail with your name on it.) Etc Etc

&amp;#x200B;

After you donated 2 times you are eligible to refer people. After people you refer donate 2 or so times successfully, you get paid for referring them. The amount varies. Sometimes it's $50 a person sometimes you get $100. Deals generally get better when all the students come back. Not many people stay around the area during summer..."

I'm a current sophomore looking to get an accounting degree. I'm at a small branch campus right now, and next year I transfer to UP to finish my degree. However, the price tag associated with that campus is alarming, and money is a big issue for me. This is why I've begun to consider PSU Altoona. It also offers an accounting major, and is a bit easier on the pocketbook. My question is this: is going to Altoona going to mean losing out on job opportunities/internships that I could get at UP? Would the price difference be worth losing what UP has to offer? And furthermore, for those who went to UP, how much did you end up having to pay after financial aid and scholarships were considered? Are scholarships plentiful at UP? 

As you can see by that barrage of questions, I'm a bit worried about where to go from here. Private student loans are something I'd like to avoid, but they seem to be an all too real inevitability at this point. Thanks for reading this short novel."

d8b4l5,https://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/d8b4l5/the_mystery_of_the_steam_tunnels/,The Mystery of the Steam Tunnels,37,33,2019-09-23 12:01:22,"Recently something very strange has been going on the in the steam tunnels underneath campus. The tunnels have always been place of interest. Back in 2002 a group of students went down and explored and mapped the tunnels. Since then, all entrance to the steam tunnels has been strictly banned and motion sensors have been added to the entrance. 

Four weeks ago I first noticed something strange happening in the tunnels. I saw what looked like a group of figures entering one of the steam grates. Since then I have been obsessed with what is going on in them. 

I did some research into what could be happening in the tunnels. I tried to find anyone that would be given access to the tunnels other than staff. Maybe a exploration club or secret society. The school confirmed that they have a zero tolerance for students entering the tunnels, and wouldn't give anyone access due to safety concerns. That raised the question, what did I see going into those tunnels?

Maybe I just saw some construction workers doing a late shift. But they weren't wearing high visibility clothes and there almost a dozen of them. Maybe it was some students sneaking into the tunnels. But how did they get in and not set off any alarms?

I can only see one explanation, there is a secret much bigger than any club or ""secret society"". Consider the possibility that there is a fourth secret society. A real secret society, unlike the three that are commonly known. A secret society with student and faculty involvement. They meet in the only place they know they would never get caught.

At a school like Penn State a society like this would have incredible power. Skull and bones, Parmi nous, and Lion's paw are really just glorified clubs, for leaders to socialize with each other without holding any real power. Now, a secret society with faculty involvement, that would have power. Students would be able to directly influence the school without being elected and entirely in secret. It would be a schoolwide scandal.

I know my theory is a long shot, so I've been doing some investigating into the possibility. The first time I noticed people entering the grates was on a Tuesday around midnight. The following Tuesday around 11 I visited all the grates locations I knew of to see if I could find them again. I couldn't find anyone, but I did hear music coming from the grates outside the eisenhower auditorium. The following Tuesday was a total bust. After walking the path of the grates for an hour I found nothing. 

I think it is likely that they alternate the days that they visit in order to make their presence more difficult to find. Instead, they might have seen my previous post on the subject and changed the day they meet.

Since the second week I haven't found any more evidence that people are meeting in the steam tunnels, but I'm only one person, and I can't be everywhere at once. My hope is that people reading this might be interested and decide to help me find the truth of this situation. 

I think it is unlikely they would have this post removed, but I suspect it will drive them to be more careful in the future. Stay sharp. The truth is here, we just need to find it."

The Responsible Action Protocol was implemented by Penn State after the Beta Theta Pi incident. It strongly aligns with the Good Samaritan law. It states that if someone calls 911 to help someone who is showing signs of alcohol poisoning, neither the caller NOR the victim will face any underage, possession of alcohol, etc. 
HOWEVER, the caller must IN GOOD FAITH believe that they are the FIRST person to call for help. Doesn’t matter if the caller is intoxicated by drugs or alcohol. The other people present at the time are NOT covered and should leave the premises if they are worried about facing legal trouble. 
The caller must also stay with the victim until help arrives.
The only reprimand that the two people involved will receive is that they have to attend an alcohol education class on campus FREE OF CHARGE. (Saves both people $200 each)

If there are any questions, please ask them below. I am very confident in my knowledge on this topic, and I enjoy spreading the information because it could save a life."

Stop  taking up multiple spaces by double-parking. Not sure how you ""escaped""  from being parked in by my car, but clearly the community is sick of  you. No, I couldn't get you towed because we don't have ""assigned spots""  (thank you SO much, Walk's, for also being dicks), but I'd like to  thank the administration of V.V. for not having \*me\* towed, either, for  parking in what was effectively the middle of the lot.

Thank  you for all the people who failed to hit my car as it blocked this  guy/gal in. And most especially, thank you to the two hilarious folks  who left the notes of support!

Sincerely,

I cant do this though since it was used as an example in class. I'm having a hard time finding any local issues that also has research to suggest solutions. My only personal issues with PA and PSU are penndot construction (which i cant really find research on to support a solution), skateboards/bikes which honestly isnt a big issue, and the cold weather, which obviously wouldnt be a valid topic.

For all the students in this sub, how do you like it as a grad student at Penn State? 

How do you feel location-wise? Trapped or comfortable with the activities and opportunities available in town? How’s the level of diversity? 

I’m currently doing an MSc at UO in Eugene OR, but I’m considering PhD work out there. Huge fan of the diversity in food and the (relatively) diverse population where I live now, I liked my U/G institution in Milwaukee, WI even more for it’s level of diversity and sizable metro population lots to do and lots of great burbs by the city. The weather’s fair and it’s absolutely gorgeous in terms of landscape in OR... Considerably more temperate and significantly more scenically beautiful than WI.

Ideally, I’d like to lay down some roots when it comes to where I head for PhD work so I want to move somewhere where I’ll fit in well... I’d greatly appreciate anyone’s advice or anecdotes on their current/past experiences. Apologies for the long winded-ness and thank you in advance!!!"

*The following article was published today in Penn State News:*  


Based on evolving federal guidance and statewide mitigation plans announced by Gov. Tom Wolf around the growing coronavirus pandemic and the global efforts underway to stop its spread, Penn State has extended the remote-delivery period for all classes through at least the spring semester. Examinations will also be administered remotely. Additionally, spring commencement ceremonies will be postponed while the University explores options for celebrating the achievements of our students. These decisions align with recommendations from the federal government that call for restricting of all gatherings of more than 10 people.   


""Graduation is a significant milestone for our students and while it may not be the same as our traditional ceremony, we are committed to finding the best way possible to recognize the achievements of our graduates,"" said Penn State President Eric J. Barron. ""However, as the world works together to slow the spread of COVID-19, these decisions must be made with public health at the forefront along with the health and wellness of our students, faculty, staff, their families, and our local communities.""  


**The University will announce soon a schedule for students to return to campus to move out of their on-campus residence halls. It is essential that students know they will not be able to swipe into their on-campus residences until they receive specific information and detailed instructions regarding the schedule. This is critical to the University's efforts to create as much social distancing as possible and maintain a low level of exposure risk to our students as well as all of our local communities.**   


**""The University will also work with local authorities, landlords, and student leaders, where we can, to develop strategies to minimize the impact of students returning to our communities to retrieve personal belongings,"" said Barron. ""We encourage**  **all students to be patient as they await further guidance and support.""**   


With this announcement there will be other questions about room and board refunds, on-campus jobs, internships, research projects and many other topics. University leadership is working on these issues, and more information will be forthcoming soon.   


""We also know that this is causing significant distress for many in our Penn State family, for a variety of reasons. Please know, while we are not together physically, we are here to support you virtually in any way we can,"" Barron continued. ""The administration, faculty and staff are doing everything we can to manage disruptions to your learning, teaching, working and living arrangements as much as possible, given these extraordinary circumstances.

They were some of the funniest, understanding, and caring people I've ever had a class with. I'd look forward to my 8AMs and I am the laziest person ever.

*And then the rona happened...*

**Prof 1:** My favorite, doesn't do zoom for class, but office hours are three hours long accounting for time zones. Stand up guy for doing this twice a week.  9.5/10 on the rona scale.

**Prof 2**: Didn't enjoy him much before, but pre-recorded lectures at 5AM PST that are unavailable after 1 hour? Even an unbiased person thinks that's messed up. 1/10 rona scale.

**Prof 3:**  Attendance questions due Monday of the next week. Slides are titled ""Attendance Q"" with the answer on the screen - not some diamond in the rough thing. Worth 40% of the grade with HW/exams being 20%/40%. The lowest exam and 2 lowest HWs are dropped. 9/10.

**Prof 4:** Boiled down the lectures to stuff needed for the exams exclusively. Just had an exam and it gave ""if you even looked in the direction of your notes you got a B"" vibes. 10/10 rona score sir.

**Prof 5:** Announcements each week laying out the plan, what's due, changes made. Shows changes on Canvas as well. Will answer every question in zoom. Teaches the 200+ person class mostly the same. Moves homework/quizzes to give time to learn the material. 10/10 for you too.

All this (80% serious/20% joking) to say: To the profs who actually took into consideration that students hate ZoomState and still teach the class with lower student motivation - **y'all are a different breed.**

PS. Shoutout Goffe and Dave Brown for the perfect scores."

-I know Berks is pretty far from University Park, and I’m hearing that University Park is big for football games and parties. Are there still parties/ any games near/ on the Berks campus?

-For housing, are the different housing facilities assigned according to seniority? In other words, would I (a freshman) be able to live in the single suites in the Woods, or are they reserved for upperclassmen?

-Where can I find other people who are going to Berks? I can only find people going to University Park on Instagram and Facebook.

-What are the best and worst things about the campus? 

-Should I get a roommate randomly assigned to me, or find one myself? If I should find one, where should I look?

As the title says, our directory will showcase all of the local breweries, cideries, wineries, and distilleries in the area. We'll be posting reviews for all of these places as well as have a detailed, multi-point ranking system. We'll then update these rankings and reviews on a yearly basis or sooner if a business has  major change.

&amp;#x200B;

Our end goal is to create a vibrant community that shares local drinks and events with one another, helping promote community and business growth throughout our region. Due to these community oriented goals, we have created a Discord server and a Facebook group where people can go and share photos of their delicious looking drinks, photos of good times being had, post events that are happening, and of course be social with one another. We want to connect people (now that we're starting to be able to leave our houses again).

&amp;#x200B;

We're calling this a soft launch, because we're not fully done yet. Only the brewery and cidery directories are done. We call this 'The Pub'. We're still working on the other two sections. 'The Corkroom' is for wineries and 'The Liquor Cabinet' will be for distilleries. Our Discord is mostly setup and should be done in the next day or two. We have a Facebook Group that's approaching 100 members so far and people are starting to post content. Please join us on either of these platforms and help us push the drink local conversation!

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks to feedback from our users we've added a search or option to filter results in our directory an we've added a Map of all of the local places. Feel free to continue to give us feedback.

When I first opened the main door to our room, I realized that all of our doors were left wide open on the inside, meaning that if one of my roommates had decided to move out before me, they could have entered my room and stolen from me. On top of that, there was a guy there that I didn't recognize—he was not one of my roommates, and it *seemed* as if he was living in one of the other bedrooms. (I avoided conversation with him, so I'm not absolutely certain that he was living there, but he was behaving in a way that made it seem as if he was.) 
  
When I actually entered my bedroom, there was a pair of safety glasses laying on the ground, indicating that someone was in my bedroom. Thankfully, everything was as I left it, and even if it wasn't, I had removed most of my valuables before quarantine. 
  
There was no staff present to enforce the social distancing guidelines that they said were required when moving out—even though they explicitly stated that you could only bring one person to assist you and that you had to wear masks, a group of 5 maskless people parked next to us and were in the process of moving out.  
  
Overall, the whole situation seemed irresponsible on the school's part, and I was curious if this was standard practice across all of the campuses, or if this was a unique situation.  
  
Thanks!"

Reading Twitter feeds is worthless, and students here seem to be more level-headed and less likely to say that liberal professors should be rounded up or that tuition should be free for ten years. 

I plan to reach out to my students in a few weeks after people shift their schedules, but I am interested in people now. Admittedly, the toughest thing for me with students is the minority who do not seem to understand why this is happening (e.g., Barstool PSU constantly referring to Zoom university as if other universities didn't do the same thing). I also worry that people who complain the loudest are going to have the most negative impact on all students--the more people devalue their current education, the more employers will do the same. I wish I could wave a wand and everyone would say, ""You know what, this is what it is. We might not get the Penn State education we hoped for, but we still are getting a quality education."" I know that's wishful thinking. 

So, genuinely, how are you feeling? Are you confused with the sudden shift? Relieved? Worried? What do you think of the decisions?

hi14tl,https://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/hi14tl/psa_dsst_and_clep_exams_earn_actual_penn_state/,PSA: DSST and CLEP exams earn actual Penn State credits but cost less,8,17,2020-06-29 07:44:35,"If you're looking at a semester of all online lecture classes, consider taking DSST and CLEP exams for a fraction of the price. Penn State is unusual among big schools - it allows credit by third party examination. You can get actual PSU credits by taking standardized tests called CLEPs or DSSTs. These do not affect your GPA and directly give GS/GA/GH credits and substitute for quite a few specific common classes up to the 300 level, like Math 140. **DSSTs and CLEPS both cost \~$100 for 3 credits, vs $2700-$4500 for a 3 credit PSU course.**

Yes, you will not get the classroom experience. You have to be highly motivated to study on your own. They are not as good as a ""real class"" since they are designed to validate prior knowledge rather than teach. An online class or 300 person lecture is also not as good as a ""real class"", and PSU has allowed both for ages, so you should at least be aware that you have another option.

[PSU list of CLEPs](https://admissions.psu.edu/academics/credit/clep/) \- read **CAREFULLY**

[PSU list of DSSTs](https://admissions.psu.edu/academics/credit/dsst/) \- read **CAREFULLY**!

This is not well known. Most schools that allow DSSTs and CLEPs only allow them to be used to test out of prerequisite courses, rather than to earn credit. I think Penn State allows them for actual credit in order to be more competitive in attracting active and ex military tuition dollars to World Campus (vets can go to WC with DSST/DANTES credit and graduate sooner, so they pick Penn State).

When I did this **you had to take a class that directly substituted for a named PSU class** to get any benefit. Read individual exam descriptions on the linked pages. **Example:** the Sociology CLEP directly substitutes for SOC 001, which is a 3 credit GS class. If you need 3 GS credits, or need SOC 001 as part of entrance to major requirements, you can take this CLEP instead and you are good to go - it's like you took SOC 001, and you get 3 credits for it, but your GPA doesn't change.

Exams that provide ""no credit"" or ""general credit"" were useless (not sure if this is still the case). ""General credit"" *sounds* like GA/GS/GH but at the time I did this they could only be used to meet the raw numeric credit count needed for entry to major or graduation and did not supply gen ed credits of the type you need to graduate. The language on the website can be confusing so verify with your advisor. If you only need to get raw credits you might as well take an exam that substitutes for an actual course rather than one of the general credit exams.

Talk to your advisor. Some advisors may not be familiar with this option or not understand it and you may need to get a ""second opinion"". When I did it I had to talk to someone in (I believe) the office of the registrar and then follow up again after taking the exams to guarantee that the credits appeared on my transcript. Your academic advisor should be your first step.

I did two CLEPs one DSST in order to graduate sooner and cheaper. I prepared by picking subjects I already had general familiarity with, got two recommended textbooks per exam using interlibrary loan, and read them cover to cover with exercises over the course of a week. Then I took all the exams in one sitting. This was enough to pass all three exams. I didn't buy any dedicated test prep materials, which are expensive. They say that some of the DSSTs like History of the Soviet Union are hard (I didn't try that one). Fundamentally these are multiple choice tests from a limited question pool. They are like the multiple choice part of an AP test. Individual questions felt harder than multiple choice questions from 100 level big lecture classes but the exams themselves are pass fail and the bar to pass is pretty low.

A big problem given current circumstances is that you need to go physically in person to an accredited testing center, you can't do this online. PSU has one now, but it is closed indefinitely. You may have to look pretty far afield to find an open testing center (the St. Francis testing center in Cambria County may be open.)"

It's not perfect, but it's an improvement.

&gt;Penn State Faculty and Staff:  
&gt;  
&gt;The confluence of a pandemic, extraordinary financial stress and a social justice crisis have caused unprecedented challenges to our University. The stress and frustration are also exacerbated by our inability to make promises when change is constant and future circumstances are difficult to predict. We deeply regret that each of you have been operating in an environment where you are concerned about your physical and mental well-being, as well as your financial security. Certainly, each of these stresses weigh heavily on our efforts to focus on our shared purpose, which is our educational mission.  
&gt;  
&gt;At the outset of the pandemic, we stressed that that the University had three priorities: (1) the health and safety of our faculty, staff and students; (2) completion of our mission of educating students; and (3) the financial well-being of our employees and our community. Failures in social justice, health disparities and the clear evidence of systemic racism and bias amplify and extend the importance of these priorities. Although we face considerable uncertainty, we want to reaffirm our commitment to your security.  
&gt;  
&gt;Our commitment to health and safety related to the pandemic remains as the highest priority. We began with the promise to meet or exceed the guidance from the state of Pennsylvania and the CDC for testing. Few found this commitment sufficient. Unfortunately, federal approvals, supply chain issues and testing capabilities prevented us from providing a more detailed and complete plan at that time. We have been working diligently on a robust capability, guided by medical science, of testing and contact tracing that is based on partnerships with private providers, local and state governments, and growth in internal capabilities. In addition, we have been working to mass purchase masks and hand sanitizer stations, modify classrooms and outline rules for enforcement. We have had a strong focus on safety for those with underlying medical conditions or who are high risk. We continue to follow Pennsylvania guidelines that those who can work at home should continue to do so. As our plans crystallize, they will continue to be posted on [virusinfo.psu.edu](https://virusinfo.psu.edu/). A robust capability for testing, contact tracing, isolation and quarantine is a critical and necessary requirement for face-to-face education. The University is preparing to announce the implementation of a comprehensive testing and tracing plan in the very near future.  
&gt;  
&gt;Our approach to the mode of teaching is also a key factor in ensuring that faculty and graduate students feel safe in the classroom. Our approach has been to ask the faculty for their preference and to work with academic leaders to understand the academic requirements and the health and safety needs of faculty and graduate students. Interestingly, our challenge is to find sufficient classroom space, given social distancing requirements, for all of the faculty who do wish to teach face to face or in hybrid mode. We continue to work at optimizing classrooms and adding other spaces to our inventory, given the desire of both students and faculty for face-to-face or hybrid teaching.  
&gt;  
&gt;Further, our focus on multiple modes of teaching, multiple choices for students, with the associated purchase of equipment like microphones and cameras, is designed for us to be nimble – nimble to help a student who is under quarantine continue their studies, nimble for an international student who cannot attend in person and nimble if health conditions or testing limitations require us to move fully remote. Likewise, the decision to move fully remote after Thanksgiving is entirely based on health concerns and limiting the potential to reintroduce significant new viral infections into our community.  
&gt;  
&gt;We would also like to put to rest the mix of rumors that the administration would somehow utilize information on teaching requests or challenges to remote delivery to penalize. Our commitment should be obvious from our shared governance work with the University Faculty Senate to modify the tenure clock and limit administrative use of SRTEs as we switched to remote education in the spring. We will absolutely continue to work in partnership with the Senate while we consider alternatives, and importantly, as we develop tools to enable faculty to engage in critical teaching and research.  
&gt;  
&gt;The financial stress on our University is clear. As a tuition-driven University, enrollment overwhelmingly governs our budget. Our best estimate of revenue for our educational budget is a loss of between $130 and $150 million for the current year. Some scenarios suggested the loss could be much greater, nearly a half a billion dollars with continued significant losses for multiple years. Further, our auxiliaries have been heavily impacted as we returned housing and food contract dollars to students. Our hotels and other facilities are generating no income. Yet, we made a public promise to support the financial well-being of our employees. Even with approximately 2,000 employees who could not come to work and could not work from home, we committed sufficient salary, that when added to weekly federal stimulus payments, has made our employees whole and enabled them to keep their benefits. This plan was overwhelmingly approved by the Teamsters. We continued to pay other employees who could only work part-time from home at their full salaries. We exhausted the reserves in our auxiliaries in order to keep our commitment to our employees. Today, with one painful exception, because we will close a hotel for the long-term in order to use it for housing, we are continuing our commitment to keep our employees whole.  
&gt;  
&gt;Unfortunately, our commitment is not without limit. The worst-case scenario, with multiple years of large deficits, would put the University in an untenable position. Some have suggested that the wealth of our endowment would save us, and that we could continue to promise salaries and even raises for the long-term despite significant decreases in enrollment. However, more than 90% of our endowment is restricted either by binding agreement or to service debt or to support promised scholarships, and 8% is committed directly to specific colleges. Only about 2% is truly unrestricted. It would be fiscally irresponsible to make long-term promises in the midst of the pandemic under these conditions. However, we believe that through our hard work and efforts to manage our resources, we can continue our commitments to our employees. As insurance, the Board of Trustees authorized a line of credit totaling $250 million for the University if needed to weather the storm.  
&gt;  
&gt;We understand that the current lack of details on much of our important planning has caused stress for many on our campuses and in our communities. We will be announcing in the next few days another town hall meeting at which we will share more information about specific plans and action items to be ready for a return to campus.  
&gt;  
&gt;We face another profoundly important crisis, born of a long history of systemic racism and bias in our country. Reversing systemic racism and bias is a moral imperative and will require persistent and consistent effort and investment. But current events have demonstrated an urgency if we are to protect the health and safety of our community and ensure that our students reach their educational goals. The character of the crisis is very different, but the impact on mental and physical health and the impact on educational opportunity are extraordinary, and are amplified by the pandemic. The actions announced in my June 10 letter, and the proposals expected from the Select Commission on Racism, Bias and Community and other task groups must be a priority for the University. The results of these deliberations and University actions will be posted at [actiontogether.psu.edu](https://actiontogether.psu.edu/).  
&gt;  
&gt;The challenges are unprecedented, but we are guided by our commitment to faculty, staff and students. We recognize the stress and frustration caused by our inability to make promises in many cases due to the ever-changing landscape that we face. We do promise to focus on our priorities to the best of our ability.

With the new semester underway, we just wanted to stop in and let you all know how to join the Collegian if you are interested. We're always looking to expand our staff, and, even given the current circumstances of the coronavirus era, we believe we can offer valuable experience to all students — not just communications majors.

If you are interested in joining, you can find our tryout form [here](https://www.collegian.psu.edu/join/). It is a short form that won't take you too long, so don't be intimidated by it at all. While we used to conduct tryouts at our office, the coronavirus threw a wrench in things a little bit.

Think you want to join but have questions? We're having a Zoom Q&amp;A on Tuesday from 7-8 p.m. You can find out more about that [here](https://www.collegian.psu.edu/join/). 

You can also reach out to our editor-in-chief Maddie Aiken at editorinchief@psucollegian.com if you cannot attend the Zoom session.

After that I decided to dedicate myself to my work and get good grades. I will emphasize this in my essays.

Many people recommended that OP just talk to the hosts and ask them to quiet down. In my experience, asking people not to do something doesn't ever work well--done it several times for anything from pets to noise--and calling the cops is just the better option. For situations like the ones I'm describing (think like, people partying and screaming outside at 2 a.m. on a weeknight when I had work in the morning and earplugs in already) you will want the non-emergency number:

800-479-0050

Again, I would highly recommend that if you want to do something about a situation that isn't an emergency, you should call this number. I have been screamed at by people for asking them to put their dog on a leash, yelled at by people for asking them to quiet down at 3 a.m., shoved because I tried to break up a fight in the parking lot of my complex late at night. Asking them directly iisn't worth the stress or potential harm that drunk and/or angry people can cause you.

The non-emergency number isn't gonna automatically get people arrested or something like that. Usually the cops will just tell them to be quiet or, if they're in an outdoor location, ask them to disperse. The township cops that came to my apartment complex were always cordial and never came off to me as belligerent or, well, bastards. They know that college kids are college kids and they aren't going to waste their time cracking down hard on one incident unless there's like, I dunno, a repeated pattern or something.

Inb4: downvotes because people think that being in college gives them the Constitutional right to disrupt others' peace/sleep/study environment/whatever and/or that going to the cops is ""snitching"" (when really it just prevents a fight, or COVID transmission, or bad blood between neighbors).

*edit: getting a lot of hate, as presumed. My point with this post: asking people to stop doing something first has caused or exacerbated problems for me in the past and the non-emergency number is a good way to avoid that. Also, re: the ""you suck for not letting people have fun"" argument: having fun is great. Parties are great. Parties where you talk to your neighbors to let them know you're having one first and then set up an environment where they can approach you safely if needed are great. Parties where people have to be obnoxious and inconvenience others to have fun are not great.*

**Edit on my edit: Use the number if you like, or don't. My recommendation and opinions don't have to mean anything to strangers on the Internet; if you disagree, that's absolutely fine and you're entitled to feeling differently. I'm just providing it here for anyone who wants it.**"

jur9xa,https://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/jur9xa/thoughts_on_psu_football_this_season/,Thoughts on PSU football this season,78,111,2020-11-15 11:03:20,"You know what? Im not gonna go for the kneejerk reaction.

Penn State was not a top 20 team heading into the season.

Penn State overperformed last season

We went 11-2.

- 2 wins vs non P5 teams

- Close win against Pitt

8-2 record inside the Big 10

- Good wins against Maryland, Purdue, Michigan State and Rutgers

- Close wins against Michigan and Iowa which could have gone the other way

- Close loss against Minnesota which could have gone the other way

- Blowout Loss to Ohio State.

- Solid win in the bowl game

Sean Clifford was never good but his mediocre performance was compensated by a good running backs and fantastic defense. Our best player from last season (Micah Parsons) opted out of the season due to COVID and our best 2 Running Backs (Noah Cain and Journey Brown) are out for the season. You add this to the fact that we had no time over summer to practice and we have no home crowd advantage then we were destined to be trash this season.

As for our performances this season.

- Overtime Loss to Indiana - We could have won this game is Penix was just 1 cm shorter from hitting the pylon. Unfortunate that we lost but on another day we win this game (also unfortunate that we missed multiple field goals). This is a Quality (tm) loss against a good Indiana team.

- Loss against Ohio State. (Expected prior to season)

Ohio State is a very good team and we kept it reasonably close.

- Loss against Maryland.

This one I am less sympathetic towards, Maryland has a good QB in Tua's brother and the PSU team was probably dejected due to starting the season 0-2 but at the end of the day 35-19 is flattering to us. Bad loss.

- Loss to Nebraska. Close loss to Nebraska, we were close to tying the game up, shame Franklin decided to stop running and used fade routes at the end. If Levis started we at the very least tie this game, if clifford had a little more confidence (lets say we started 2-1 instead of 0-3) we at the very least tie this game.

Overall it sucks that we started 0-4 but I hope PSU gives Franklin another season. Im not saying the coaching is great, but what I'm saying is that it is not horrendous. This team isn't as good as last season, but is much better than our record of 0-4."

I am an international graduate student. Ever since the pandemic and lockdown started, my life was at its lowest ebb. My summer internship got rescinded, there were no flights to go back home so I was stuck, I hardly have any friends here in State College, and being a big gym freak, staying home and eating food as a coping mechanism really took toll on my physical and mental health to the point that I was even considering serious self-harm. 

But well, my friends and parents really motivated me to push through. Fast forward some four months- my thesis research is making great breakthroughs, job search is still dicey but I have made several important additions to my professional network, I traveled back home last week and got to see my family, and today I got all my grades on LionPath for Fall 2020 and scored all A’s!! Now I am motivated for the final semester of my masters degree and hopefully land a job before I graduate! 

I just want to extend hope and support to those who are reading this and are not in the best place in their lives right now. Just hang in and keep working at your pace, it’s all bound to be good eventually. If it happened to me, it can happen to anyone!

However, they have not really gone out of their way to “make it up” to their graduating seniors in either year. For example, spring ‘20’s virtual graduation was an absolute joke. 
Maybe this is just my experience, but my friends, gf, and I don’t feel that we have the same connection with this place as prior students. To me, it doesn’t seem like the University or Alumni Association truly understands that these classes may not give back to the Penn State community (i.e. donations) as much as other classes have.

(PHYS 251),2,3,2021-01-20 11:24:38,"Day 2 of classes and this dude already makes me want to drop out of PHYS 251. I watched two lecture videos and done the post-lecture assignments, and have gotten only 75% on both of them, despite taking them both twice and taking notes. Granted, we haven't even had a real class lecture yet, but these post-lecture videos are due before then. I asked Van Hook for moving the post-lecture quizzes to AFTER the synchronous lectures are due, and he said no and it is my responsibility for rewatching the videos until I ""understand the content"".

If I said the same sentence to Van Hook a billion times in a language like Tagalog, this man would never, ever, understand what I was saying. But, by telling me to rewatch videos until I understood the content, he essentially is saying, ""yeah, I explained everything perfectly in those videos, and if you don't understand it, tough shit"". I am in the process of doing the homework on ExpertTA. Not only is it lengthy and tedious, it covers problems I do not know how to do yet, because the videos do a shit job at explaining these types of problems. Also, I already have a lab due Sunday I haven't even started, and I already feel confused and behind on concepts already and there is no support or way to get help because I'm just told to rewatch the videos and Inshallah until I understand.

Anyone that had the misfortune of taking PHYS 251 with this man, how do you survive?"

&amp;#x200B;

\- **How do I find out about events going on around campus?**

For career/academic events, keep an eye on your Penn State email. Your college and most organizations on campus are pretty desperate for people to go to their events - so go to them! You'll probably get emails from your college, Penn State Today, the Multicultural Resource Center, and more on a regular basis. You'll also find flyers in your residence hall, commons buildings, and almost every bulletin board on campus.

For other events, most organizations make a semi-decent effort to publicize their events, and by signing up for some email lists at the involvement fair (please go) you'll end up on their lists for event outreach. Don't be that dude who signs your friend up for every single club's email list, though.

Lastly, restrooms in the HUB, residence halls, and certain other buildings have event-related newsletters posted in each stall. Some nice reading while you do your business!

&amp;#x200B;

**- How do I connect to \[x\] WiFi network?**

For students, go [here](http://wireless.psu.edu/wireless.html) for your main devices and [here](https://roomgear.psu.edu/guest/roomgear.php?_browser=1) for your dorm-related smart devices. For guests, if you're a university student, [eduroam](https://www.incommon.org/eduroam/) is probably the way to go (it likely works with your own university's login). For visitors, try connecting to the new [psu-guest](https://wireless.psu.edu/visitorwireless_alt.html) network on campus.

&amp;#x200B;

**- What are the job or internship prospects for my major?**

It greatly varies - and it depends on the person. Penn State boasts the largest alumni network in the world, and looking for Penn State alumni at companies you apply for is helpful - especially recruiters. Most departments and colleges maintain some kind of job statistics database and career assistance program, so try looking there for resources like how to write a resume, how to apply for jobs, and etc. I will say the [IST career site](https://ist.psu.edu/current/careers) is the best of them all though. Overall, you determine your own future, and Penn State will only help you with that.

&amp;#x200B;

**- How do I get help with my classes?**

There's a ton of resources on campus to help you out with classes if you're struggling or need help. Professors usually offer TAs, office hours, tutoring, and maybe even a message board to help you succeed in their courses. Past that, [Penn State Tutoring](https://pennstatelearning.psu.edu/), [LionTutors](https://penn.liontutors.com/), and others are great resources. Your tuition is paying for Penn State Tutoring, TAs, and office hours, so make sure to make the most out of those.

&amp;#x200B;

**- What do I do if I'm going to fail a course?**

Easy answer: you should drop or late drop it, if you've already tried your best to improve. Keep in mind there are deadlines for dropping and late dropping (see the [Academic Calendar](http://www.registrar.psu.edu/academic-calendars/) for details) and that LDs appear on your transcript. Employers typically don't mind 1-2 non-major-related late drops, but more than that will probably hurt. Do keep in mind your GPA and your financial aid when looking at dropping a course though - as well as losing full time status below 12 credits. If you can't late drop or drop the course, look at [grade forgiveness](https://undergrad.psu.edu/aappm/H-2-undergraduate-grade-forgiveness.html) \- a great new policy that only recently came through.

&amp;#x200B;

\- **How do I check my academic requirements?**

A simple Google Search for ""psu academic requirements (major)"" will usually do the trick - each college has lists of ETM and major requirements for each of their majors! To easily check your progress towards the requirements, you can create a What-If Report in LionPATH that will tell you what your progress is :)

&amp;#x200B;

\- **What are the best dorms on campus?**

That's a really subjective question, and everyone has their own opinion on it. While we do plan for a post covering this extensively eventually, here's a quick summary of the pros and cons of each residence area (if you have any suggestions for additions, let us know):

East Halls

|Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|
|Mostly Renovated|Distant From Most Of Campus|
|Freshman Only|Some Unrenovated Dorms|
|Lots Going On|Oftentimes Noisy|

West Halls

|Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|
|Close to Engineering/IST/Library/HUB|Far from Beaver Stadium|
|Quiet|Not as much going on|
|Superior cookies and paninis|Relatively Unrenovated|

North Halls

|Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|
|Quiet AF|Meh Food|
|Close to Business/Arts/etc|Far From Downtown|
|Suite-Style Dorms|Expensive $$$$$$|
|Individual Bathrooms|No ""Freshman Dorms"" Experience|
|Renovated Dorms|Tiny Commons|

South / Pollock Halls (they're like the same area lmao)

|Pros|Cons|
|:-|:-|
|Lots Going On|Pollock is like living in the 1960s. The dorms are that bad.|
|Next to Downtown|South = Honors Dorms (quiet af)|
|Sorority Central ;)|Tall Bois|
|South Renovated = nice|Traditional-Style Dorms|
|Great Food|Tiny Dorms|

&amp;#x200B;

**- I got into \[x\] branch campus and want to go to University Park. Can I transfer?**

Short answer: no, otherwise branch campuses would be a ghost town. You probably won't be able to switch to main campus until junior year (2+2 plan) so make the most out of your two years at your branch. Most branch campuses have their redeeming characteristics - particularly Behrend - and you can live your college life to the fullest at a branch campus just as well. Main campus is no further than three or four hours from any branch, so you can still drive up to main for football, partying, and to get the Penn State experience.

&amp;#x200B;

\- **What are my chances of getting in?**

In terms of University Park, the relative agreement is that you need at least a 1160 SAT, 25 ACT, and 3.0 GPA to get in. Results vary widely, though - [Niche](https://www.niche.com/colleges/penn-state/) has a ton of stats on your relative chances of getting in with your specific SAT, ACT, and GPA. They also like to see a decent mix of extracurriculars to know you're not a boring fuck, but the fact that admissions is rolling and there's no essay makes for a relatively easy application.

In terms of Schreyers, it gets a hella lot more competitive. Expect to need a 3.8 or above GPA, a 1450 or above SAT, 30 or above ACT, and stellar extracurriculars to get into Schreyers. You'll also need to write essays and go through an interview to be considered. The benefits are nice, though - you get cushy dorms, great advisors, the chance to do research and publish a thesis, and tons of scholarship money.

Branch campus requirements vary widely, so again, check Niche for the stats on your branch campus. The common conception is that getting into a branch campus is relatively easy, to the point where some branches are more community colleges than actual branches, so you shouldn't have too much of an issue unless you're doing law or medical school or something.

&amp;#x200B;

**- Best Gen Ed Classes?**

This is a very subjective question and dependent on what you enjoy. I'll add links soon, but some well known ones include ASTRO 7N and EGEE 101. A quick Google search will give you lists upon lists of others, but do be aware that it is very highly dependent on what you enjoy and what you're looking to learn from gen eds.

&amp;#x200B;

Email Dr. Seymour ([ems22@psu.edu](mailto:ems22@psu.edu)) and myself ([StudentLifeChair@psu.edu](mailto:StudentLifeChair@psu.edu)) or use this form: tinyurl.com/PSUSenateForm but email is preferred. Some classes have exemptions. 

Mods: A mod reached out to me to make sure I was legit. I told them I am. I still am. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am speaking personally and not on behalf of Senate or the University, but I wanted to share a few things about Wellness Days. There seems to be some miscommunication about how they work, specifically regarding exemptions. I am one of the people who receive the complaints/concerns about potential violations. All but one complaint thus far have been about classes with exemptions. The emails usually include something about how it is unfair to have class on that day, etc. If you have class on a wellness day, or if you know someone who does, they are welcome to send an email to Dr. Elizabeth Seymour ([ems22@psu.edu](mailto:ems22@psu.edu)) and/or me ([StudentLifeChair@psu.edu](mailto:StudentLifeChair@psu.edu)). If you prefer anonymity, you can also use this form:   

[tinyurl.com/PSUSenateForm](https://tinyurl.com/PSUSenateForm) (Sorry, there is no dedicated @psu page for the form; I'm trying to get this to happen)

You can use this form for all sorts of concerns about Faculty Senate rule violations (e.g., having assessments worth more than 10% on the week before finals; not receiving a syllabus), but you can also use it for wellness day violations. You do not have to leave contact information unless you want to be contacted. It does require you to be signed into PSU, but we are not collecting email addresses. 

Please know that the form is rarely used, so I sometimes forget to check it. Using the above email is the fastest way to reach us about wellness days. 

Concerning the process. If you email us, you will receive a response with some basic information. Exemptions were handled at the unit level, so we generally forward your email to the appropriate contact in the appropriate unit and CC you on that. We do have a list of all exempted classes. 

The email you receive will note that the ""exemption process is rigorous and granted only in cases where either student learning and progression in future classes would suffer, or it is required based on accreditation."" 

Some lab sections are exemptions because only one group of students would miss lab that week. For example, if there are labs on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday but the Wellness Day is a Wednesday, then one group would miss lab. Some exemptions are due to accreditation. I know that some nursing courses, student teaching, and a few other courses will fall under this exemption. 

I can try to answer questions if you have them, but please know that I had nothing to do with establishing Wellness Days. I cannot give you a huge amount of background on that.  I just volunteered to respond to emails."

2. Also do these 120 above  credits **include ELIGIBLE transfer credits.** For example if 126 credits are required for BS Computer science to graduate how many should be taken at Penn State and how many can be transfers.

I contacted her for the first time in April over email and got an automatic reply that her email got hacked and to contact her on microsoft teams. I did that and never got a response to either. I was able to set up a Starfish meeting and meet with her later on. I had a question on clinical rotations, and the deadline for me to submit my preferences (Hershey vs. University Park) is June 20th. The earliest date I could schedule for a Starfish meeting was June 17. I emailed her last Sunday and got the same automatic email that she was hacked. Thinking she wasn't going to reply, I emailed 2 other advisors telling them I couldn't get in contact until the 17th and needed help if my questions would be time-consuming to answer. 

My advisor sent me a passive aggressive email back on Monday telling me my questions weren't emergencies &amp; that it wasn't acceptable for me to email multiple people at the same time telling them I couldn't get in contact with her. I understand this behavior can be seen as unprofessional, but she was dismissal of my concerns and questions on clinical rotations which are very important to me as a nursing major, and I considered it an emergency because the deadline was less than a week away. She seemed more concerned over reprimanding me and saving her reputation over helping me with my questions. She told me that she instructed the other advisors not to respond to me. I see this as an abuse of power as she's the manager of the nursing advisor center, and I feel like it should be up to the individual advisors to decide if they want to help me. I was not aware of a policy prohibiting us from emailing multiple people. This is my first time doing so and it was only because I had a rapidly approaching deadline and had a hard time getting in touch with her in the past. 

She even accused me of doing this several times already with my old advisor and herself, which isn't true. My old advisor and I left on good terms and didn't have any unresolved issues. The only incident with this temporary advisor was me emailing another honors advisor for help on honors options because I wasn't able to meet with my own advisor until after scheduling was already open. Her dismissive and hostile attitude in this response email is making me concerned that she will be the same way in our upcoming meeting. Should I report her to a higher up (Honors college or dean) to change advisors and express my concerns ? I was thinking of giving her a chance this Thursday, but her behavior has made me really uncomfortable and worries me that she will abuse her power to badmouth me in front of other nursing advisors because she holds the title of manager."

Sure she may not be too knowledgeable on the technical end, but she was always there to listen and have a conversation with me about my future. She would often suggest opportunities like studying abroad, and undergraduate research. She guided me in planning out the niche minor I wanted to do. It genuinely felt like she wanted to help me succeed.

When I got into the EE, as all of us EECS majors know, we were reassigned to Mark Mahon, and he is absolutely awful. I only had one meeting with him in Spring 2021, and that was just to look over my schedule for Fall, and my future academic plan to make sure I was going down the right track. The whole time, he seemed very apathetic and uninterested. He would not let my share my screen to show him my schedule because ""it would take up too much of his screen"". Instead he wanted me me to read out my schedule to to him. It did not even seem that he wrote down the classes I was taking because he kept thinking I was taking EE300 instead of EE200. He just said that my schedule seems tough, but sounds good, and it simply felt he was just rushing me to get me to leave even though it has only been like 5 min. At this point, I felt so turned off, that I did not bring up my future scheduling plans, because I know he would not give a shit, and he would not let me share screen to show him the excel sheet I made. I also had a question on whether I could use the ""move 3"" to move only 2 credits to my GA. He told me he did not know the answer to that, and he would get back to me. I totally get this, but he never got back to me. I had two send two emails reiterating my question to get any sort of response. 

This really sucks because I am starting to look at my post-graduation plans, and I wanted to speculate on grad school, but I now know I probably cannot go to Mark Mahon for guidance. Maybe I met with him on a bad day where he was very busy, but just speaking to other fellow EECS folks, it seems that we all have had very similar experiences. Why the hell is he an advisor if he is so apathetic. It seems like the best place to get advice is from my professors, and upper classmen, not my actual advisor."

I like the convenience of being able to store my board anywhere, not having to worry about a bike lock or anything. The other plus is that since I live in Seattle I can bring my board with me instead of figuring out a bike in state college.

Do a lot of people ride electric skateboards?

&amp;#x200B;

I know state college technically has a ban on skateboards, but the rules don't say anything about electric boards and I haven't had issues in any other cities. Have any of you had any issues?

It would be purely for transportation, I don't skate unless I'm intending on going somewhere and I try and be respectful of vehicles, bikes and pedestrians.

I'm not sure exactly how far along in the admissions process people typically find and secure a dorm roommate (if they do), but I'm still looking for one. Some quick info:

I'm a guy, 18, Psych major and marked my preference as a Double in East Halls. I'm out-of-state from Oakland, CA, and would like to think I'm a pretty low-maintenance and easily compatible person to live with. Won't be any issues with cleanliness or conflicting lifestyles on my side and don't have any allergies to foods or household items. I'd also like to think that I'm a pretty friendly and outgoing person too :)

Don't know if I'll find any success here but might as well try. PM me if you might be interested at all!"

I have my account statement on LionPATH and I think I understand how much I’m suppose to pay if my aid remains the same. My concern is that the bursar site lays out payment into four months, so do I only pay a fourth of what I owe or do I just pay all at once at the start of the semester?

Also what are my payment methods? They have the option of connecting your credit or debit card but would I be able to use a check or cash if I’m uncomfortable with that option?

I know this isn't illegal, but it's so stupid considering that I don't even live right in downtown but a block or two from it, and there are apartments in downtown right in the center that rent for around the same price and include ALL utilities, plus actually have services in their buildings like parcel stations and fitness centers.

Online I could hop on a zoom call one minute before and be fine and I could other things in the background of meetings. Since everything was online I also feel I didn’t get a good grasp of certain subjects and having open note tests has wiped out all my study skills. I took the intro class for my major online and choose it thinking it would be a good choice but now that we are in person I’ve realized it’s entirely different in person and I hate it. My major Accounting has 7 Week semesters and class everyday and I am struggling so much with the workload. Our accounting professor expects 30 hours a week just on his class. I don’t enjoy a single class this semester and my favorite class is my gen Ed English class. My one professor is also just really mean to me. I’m so lost as to whether to switch majors to something I actually enjoy but as a junior switching seems harder than just toughing it out even though I hate my major and I’m struggling. I also have adhd and sometimes my brain doesn’t feel like it works well with such a detail oriented subject I have zero interest in.

I have a course that would fit in my schedule perfectly that would help to make up for those lost credits that I waitlisted myself originally, but it now says that the section is disabled because the section is full. I was wondering, if I wanted to try to get into the course despite of this, should I try to email the professor who teaches it? They are a professor I have taken before (though over zoom in a large lecture), and I feel like I could attempt to use this to my advantage. I appreciate any advice yall may have!"
qkdx9n,https://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/qkdx9n/moderation_complaints/,Moderation Complaints,1,37,2021-11-01 06:25:11,"My opinion is that this sub is moderated entirely too much.  There are TEN moderators for this sub of which most have no more than a year experience.  These people don't represent me and I've never had a choice in deciding who they are.  Furthermore, the content moderation is done wildly inconsistent.  

Here's a good example of inconsistent moderation.  You can mention names of professors and current / past football players and the mods leave those posts alone.  However, if you mention recent alum or current students who are celebrities, the threads are deleted.  This is bullshit and CLEARLY a double standard.  Another example is posting public links.  If you post a link to a current or even recent alum which is available to the public, the mods delete it.  Yet, students can bash CS professors and even current student football players and those threads stay open.  But, if i want to have a discussion about a B star celebrities like Heather Kirk, Cam Gregory, or Zoe Miranda, the mods delete the thread even if all that is posted is a publically accessible instagram account. This is bullshit. 

I believe on reddit that information is power and that power provides people the platform to be heard, understood, part of public discourse IF THEY SO CHOOSE.  This means, if you have a publicly accessible social media account, we can talk about it here.  If you are mainstream TV whether alumni or current student, we can talk about it here.  If you are an influencer and want to promote yourself, we can talk about it here (AND YOU CAN POST HERE).  POSTING AN IG ACCOUNT LINK IS NOT HARASSMENT.

WE ARE.... ADULTS and are fine regulating ourselves. 

The standard should be,  ""is this information public?""  If the answer is yes then it should be allowed to be posted.  We should not be thinking things like, ""well, this person maybe forgot to make their social media account private.""  This is usually wrong and also NOT YOUR JOB."

Now I don't know if it'll arrive before I leave. I have no finals and was planning to leave on Saturday and won't be able to travel back to campus all of next week. So I have two questions:

a) Once the package arrives, is there anyway to have them re-mail it out to where I'm saying, and b) Knowing that the dorms shut down on the Saturday after finals, is there any way for me to pick up my package after that?

I'll take any help I can get, and if there's no hope for me, then pray I figure something else out."

I am a junior studying communications at one of the smaller Penn State branch campuses. For my COMM260W (news writing) course, our final is a feature news story.

My feature is on the impact of the vaccine mandates, student compliance, and success overall. I need to include some content from undergraduate or graduate student workers on wage payroll or graduate assistantships at any of the 9 campuses the strict federal mandate applies to:

Altoona, Behrend, Berks, Brandywine, DuBois, Fayette, Harrisburg, Schuylkill and University Park.

I have to objectively report and get comments and interviews on all sides. I am looking for a student worker that is NOT vaccinated and cannot, or does not want to, get vaccinated. Basically, a student that the federal mandate directly affects.

I would be forever grateful to have a short Zoom, telephone, or even an email interview with you - sometime before next Wednesday. The sooner, the better. Zoom is preferable, but I am okay with the other options, too. I have 5-7 questions, and I estimate the interview would take 10-15 minutes.

My professor would be the only one directly seeing the content. I will most likely also be posting the story on my personal portfolio site. 

I appreciate any input or acceptance!"
