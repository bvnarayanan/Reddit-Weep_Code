This idea was inspired by another topic in this subreddit.

I am thinking about starting a social club for introverts at UCLA. Since most introverts have a difficult time making friends, this club will bring together people with similar social skills through gatherings, trips, etc... 

I don't know where to start and it would be much more effective to get help from other people interested in creating such a group. So if you are interested PM me, and we will work together.

P.S. I am a good introvert, so I might not show up at the first meeting. just kidding.

I've gotten used to losing to USC in football because they out recruit us but I thought we always had basketball. I like basketball more than football because I'm asian. But now we're 0-4 to them in basketball too?

We land multiple 5 star players every year while USC's highest ranked players are 3 stars and their best player Boatwright whatever didn't even play tonight.

Everyone in class was saying how great Lonzo Ball is and how Alford has earned his job back.

We were ranked #2 (!!) at some point this season and we beat #1 Kentucky. USC is fucking unranked and made us look like shit. Fuck this shit, I hate losing to USC over and over again in every sport."

Can't decide between Berkeley and UCLA (x-post from r/Berkeley),18,15,2017-01-23 16:10:45,"I'm a student from England who's been selected for the UC exchange programme starting this September. I have to choose my 3 preferred UC campuses, and I'll be putting down both Berkeley and UCLA, but I can't decide which to put as my top choice, so I'd really appreciate some help. Here are my thoughts and concerns so far, please correct me if you think any of them are wrong.

Both are incredibly strong academically, but I'm leaning slightly towards the quarter-length terms at UCLA since I like the chance to learn about more topics. Then again the 5 weeks between semesters at Berkeley would be a great time to do some travelling.  Are the breaks between terms at UCLA long enough to spend maybe a week or two doing some travelling round California? 

From the online discussions I've read, the general impression I get is that students at Berkeley are quieter, competitive and sometimes quite cold, and that the social life altogether is a bit more boring. Obviously I want to try and experience US life and culture, and socialising and making friends are a great way to do that. Obviously I'll be working hard, but parties, bars/pubs/clubs, things to do on weekends and the social scene are quite important for me.

The thought of living in LA seems awesome, but I'm a bit worried that some people think of it as a commuter college. I won't have a car, and might not be living in residence halls, is it going to be a problem getting to campus? The transit system in Berkeley seems pretty good. How easily can you get to the beach at Berkeley and LA?

Is the cost of living noticeably more expensive in LA than in Berkeley? 

Finally, an unrelated question. How many upper division courses do sophomores/juniors normally take each term/semester? (the system is very different here in Britain)

Thanks so much for any help"

I know that my school had internally distributed emails about student deaths even if there wasn't anything in the school paper yet, so I'm hoping that one of you can help me. He was (is? god I hope) a 23 year old psychology major who had just transferred there last fall. I know he was in some sort of Kpop or Kdrama related club or something and lived on campus. I don't want to put his name in the post but will PM it if anyone thinks they might know him. It would've been about 2 weeks ago or so. Thank you for reading.

I'm a female, first year pre-Bus Econ student at UCLA, and I've never been more unhappy and unsatisfied with my life. As an out of state student from the East Coast, I'm constantly stressed about the exorbitant tuition. Even though I could have just gone to my cheaper state school, I convinced myself that going to my dream school would be worth it. Now that I'm here, I'm just disappointed in myself for not excelling and feeling like I've wasted my parents' money. The pressure for me to perform and land a high-paying job right after school in order to offset these costs is suffocating, and even though I feel like I'm in the wrong major, I'm just so scared to switch now, for fear of having wasted almost 60k for a year of just prerequisites and GEs. I can't afford summer session so I'm deathly afraid that I won't be able to graduate on time and have to pay even more. I feel like there's so little room for me to fuck up, since there's so much at stake, but I've been fucking up a lot, with no one to blame but myself. I'm not doing well academically, and I just feel like I don't belong with all the crazy talented people here. I work part-time, but other than that, I'm not really involved in anything resume-building. I tried so hard fall quarter and winter quarter to offset costs by becoming involved with ResLife and then applying for RA, working part time, looking for scholarships, but in the end I fell just short of the RA position. I rushed twice for a professional business fraternity and made it to the very end of rush week both times, before being denied a bid. I was rejected for internships. I know that as a first year, I can't expect for everything to go as planned, especially when it comes to internships and when taking into consideration that this is a public university, but I've just been feeling so defeated. It's the end of winter quarter now, and I'm just so filled with regret and I just hate what my life has become. I can't help but compare myself to so many of my peers who have their shit together, and are progressing so well.  Some have told me that just transferring back home to a state school would be better, but at this point, I feel like my heart and loyalties are split between the coasts, and I don't want to back down from my own challenge. I'm just so lost, and I haven't felt happy in a long time. This is such a gross simplification of what I'm experiencing, but I hope I'm properly conveying my dilemma. If anyone out there has words of advice, it would be much appreciated. Thank you."

I'd been there once before in the day while my brother was going there, and we went to Roys (Royce? Ross? Reeses?) Hall, and it had that ivy-league feel that I'll never forget.

And at night, just the lighting everywhere, man. Mm. 

UCSB is 99% cracked bike paths and haunted elevators.

Maybe I'm just starstruck, maybe it's different actually going there. Idk. It's like the girl you'll never be able to kiss, but maybe it's better if you never do.

Anyways enjoy your campus."

With all the stress of doing well in school, as well the added pressure of not knowing if I will be able to stay in America after I graduate or not, I have been in deep bouts of depression all throughout my three years thus far at UCLA. I would like to share my situation in hopes that someone out there may be able to shed some light and guide me towards steps I should take.

I decided to re-take one of my Econ major classes even though I had passed it the first time because I thought I could get a better grade if I retook it (I'm an idiot I know). This time around, I received A's on both of my midterms. However, while studying for finals, I began to feel the stress start to pile up. I had been searching all quarter for an internship but was unable to land one because no one wants to hire an international student for fears of having to sponsor them later for an H1-B work visa. Mentally I started to break down and it started to affect my ability to study for my finals effectively. Long story short, my mind went completely blank on the final, and I ended up failing the class (even though I had passed it the first time). Since I'm also nearing my 216 unit cap, failing this class effectively kicked me out of my Econ major, and only left me with Sociology and Geography as the only two majors I can now graduate with. 

I hate myself for being such a failure in life. I hate myself for retaking that class. I hate myself for choosing to come to UCLA. If I don't graduate with a degree in a field that will allow me to receive a work visa sponsorship, I will be kicked out of America while both my parents still live here on work visa. My family definitely does not have enough money to pay for more school. I'm frustrated because of how much my parents paid for me to go to UCLA to not even be able to graduate with the degree I want because unit caps prevent me from re-taking more classes, and I can't even use my previous passing grade from the class because of UCLA's policy regarding retaken classes. 

All it took was this one single class. If I could just use my previous passing grade, I would be able to graduate as an Econ major next year. If I could just retake it a third time, I would be able to pass. My entire college experience was summed up by essentially one depressive episode and bc I couldn't get over that stress and anxiety, it potentially cost me my future. 

TL;DR : Canadian. suffer from depression. retook a major class. bombed the final due to a depressive/anxiety meltdown. can't graduate anymore. will not be able to stay in country. future and life ruined."

I clearly don't know what study habits to utilize since I go to office hours, ask questions for clarifications, review lecture notes every lecture, study for exams. I know this quarter it will be worse and I may be placed on academic probation since I had to take some challenging classes like Math 32B which I received a C (got 45 points below average) and CS33 which I may end up with a D since I got 9% and 16% on my midterms (Eggert tests are so bad but I didn't know why I did THAT badly.

Bruins,

One of my summer math classes, we had a quiz. These foreign kids ( at least 30 of them) all sat far in the back of the classroom and talked to teach other the whole quiz and cheated.

And after the quiz was over, they all moved to the front to continue the lecture.

The problem is this class is based on a curve. Only a certain number of kids get A, B C, D etc.

How do I report this to my professor anonymously?

I know they were cheating because I literally saw them with my optic face holes them working together and literally talking about the answers right next to me. When all the non cheaters were turning their quiz in, they took advantage of the commotion and turned their quiz in 5 minutes later. The professor still accepted their quizzes.

I usually wouldn't care but like I said it is based on a curve depending on how the class does overall... 

EDIT: Hi. I am going to the professor and reporting it. Please anyone and everyone email her so that she knows. Also I am getting my wisdom tooth removed this weekend :( but that's a separate issue."

### Lifetime Email

As the class gift of 2003, your UCLA email address is a lifetime email, and does not expire.

At least for a 2013-2017 student, you are given both the **@g.ucla.edu** Google Apps account and the **@ucla.edu** email alias, which can be used the following ways:

* [@g.ucla.edu](https://accounts.google.com): A Google Apps/G Suite account, essentially a Google/Gmail account, which can be logged in by entering the full ""*user*@g.ucla.edu"" when signing in at Google. It uses the UCLA login page, so you'll be redirected there, but afterwards it'll take you back to the Gmail page where you can do Google things.
* [@ucla.edu](https://logon.ucla.edu/mailprefs.php): By default, this is an alias for the above **@g.ucla.edu** email, and any email sent here will go to that inbox. What I just discovered is that you can [change the target of this alias](https://logon.ucla.edu/mailprefs.php) so emails go to whatever address you want.
* edit: [Second @ucla.edu](https://www.bol.ucla.edu/shortcut/emailaliases) Apparently you can have two aliases? There are several warnings about being unable to change it short of legal name change, so tread carefully.

#### Other Email Aliases

These don't apply to everyone, but I suspect each department has their own. Feel free to add more in the comments.

* [@alumni.ucla.edu](https://alumni.ucla.edu/frequently-asked-questions/): There's no automated method to set this up, all instructions say to just email membership@alumni.ucla.edu with your desired **@alumni.ucla.edu** address and target email.
* [@engineering.ucla.edu](http://www.seasnet.ucla.edu/lifetime-email-account/): Signup instructions should be at the link. I graduated but the summary still says no degree awarded, so either I'm in trouble or there's a delay.

### [Web Hosting](https://www.bol.ucla.edu/shortcut/webhosting) (Might expire?)

If you're really into the frugal lifestyle and  you've already used up 12 months of free-tier Amazon AWS (thanks, CS144), UCLA actually offers webhosting with a limit of 100MB total and 15MB per file, and a non-sketchy URL *uclausername*.bol.ucla.edu. It's through BOL, so I have no idea on future plans, but all the KnowledgeBase articles were updated two weeks ago. Up until then, I'm not sure they'd been updated for a while.

You upload through FTP (info [here](https://help.bol.ucla.edu/kb_view.do?sys_kb_id=203bf73cf13fc50060a225727a92e2de&amp;sysparm_nameofstack=&amp;sysparm_kb_search_table=), FileZilla works fine), and it supports PHP scripts.

I get that it simplifies the process of accounting for students, but beyond that it seems to only heighten the risk of a large number of deaths. 

I mean, in an ideal world, the most practical thing to do would probably be to have everyone leave the hill, walk to Westwood, avoid high density areas to decrease the potential loss of life, but obviously that would be hard to orchestrate and would make it difficult to account for individuals.  I just think there has to be some middle ground, maybe there should be different evacuation sites for each floor? For each building? 

I just can't imagine the optimal solution being to put everybody in a stadium...after a bomb threat. That just seems silly.

Furthermore, if a terrorist threatens to bomb UCLA, and campus officials deem the threat credible, what reason does the campus police/administration have to believe the person issuing threats is being honest about the location of the bomb?  

Do you think UCLA handled tonight's situation well, and how do you think it could be improved?"

It's a beautiful campus, of course, but I would think there would be a ton of places that might be a bigger draw.  

On the other hand, a little Googling indicates a very high percentage of students in the UC system are Asian, so maybe I was seeing a mixture of tourists AND students?  "

It's my 3rd year now and idgaf I want to do stuff. 

1) are club sports worth the time/money I'm interested in basketball, soccer, tennis, volleyball (played all four sports at some point in my life)
2) Are there are any free shows, performances, etc during the year that I should know?

I have a friend and she's been a good friend of mine since we met in Chem 14A as freshmen. However, she has this serious problem about stressing and worrying over tests and grades. Like it's *that* bad. 

She constantly whines about how she's going to fail every exam (she has a 3.95 GPA right now) and literally drags ME into it by crying to me, calling me while I'm studying so she can scream that she can't take it anymore and that she's going to get a F or D at best, constantly forcing me to WALK to her dorm to bring her food/comfort/hugs/words of encouragement when exams start coming up. Then she has the audacity to tell me I'm a bad friend if I don't support her in her times of emotional and mental trauma. 

What's even worse is after she takes the exam, she starts crying again about how hard it was and that she had to ""guess"" and most of the questions. Then when her grade comes back (she literally never gets under an A- on anything), she comes running to me screaming with joy about how she guessed correctly and that it was pure luck. 

Now don't get me wrong, I'm proud that she gets good grades. But her constant bitching and whining about how she can ""no longer handle the academic rigor of school and that she's going to fail"" is starting to really annoy the fk out of me and I've told her before to stop but this quarter has been ridiculous. I'm waiting for her constant whining once finals comes. 

Is she just exaggerating and seeking attention? Or is this something that might be a serious mental condition and needs attention from Ashe or CAPS? 

Tl;dr my psycho friend thinks she's going to fail every exam but never does and it's chipping away at my patience "

Still, I have made only 2-3 friends from my last quarter... since most of people who I have talked to and met in class/clubs/campus events only remained as shallow ""acquaintances"": They would usually act friendly and nice, some would even exchange phone numbers with you, but the next time you see them, they would act like they don't know you or smile at you while walking away.
wtf?? That is seriously the weirdest phenomenon I have experienced at this school. Does anyone have similar experiences? What are some of the advices you would give to people who are currently in this kind of situation? Thanks. "

On campus:


- if you live on campus you will have to apply for a permit each quarter. Athletes and merit scholars get permits, as well as people with documented medical issues or serious work/family commitments, but otherwise you will probably not be approved for a permit. You can buy one off a friend who is an athlete/scholar but this technically is not allowed so be careful. Permits are around  $300/quarter and the exact fees and application info are available online. 


- if you work for UCLA's parking department you can get a permit. You still have to pay for it and you can only get it while you are employed  (So you can't get hired, get a permit, and then never go to work). I did this my freshman year and it was an easy job, not the most glamorous but there was plenty of downtime for studying. There is an application online or you can go to the kiosks (main one is on Westwood plaza) and ask.


- pay per day. Not a great option because daily parking expires at 7AM and you will be ticketed if you are late renewing your daily parking. I think daily parking is $12-14 per day and  $5-6 if you have a disabled placard.


Off campus:


- street parking. It can be a mess and you might have to loop around a few times, but lots of people rely on street parking. It's free unless you don't move your car for street cleaning and get ticketed  (Thursday or Friday mornings depending on the location). Drive around the village and veteran to find a spot.


- apartments are your best bet for finding garage parking. Contact the building managers to see if they have spots available for rent - I know Atrium and Club Cali often have availabilities.


I hope this helps!"

If you find space fascinating, enjoy looking at stars, like to ponder the mysteries of the universe, want to try a new experience, or any of the above come join us on our first UAS outing for the quarter!

It’s a camping trip from Jan 13-14 and hopefully we can have a great time, see some awesome constellations, and connect with nature and each other due to our shared admiration of astronomy. 

All majors are invited- whether you are studying art, astrophysics, business, sociology, biology, engineering, theatre, or whatever, come! The only thing required is that you have an interest and appreciation for the stars, space, and skies, and that you are a genuine and good person. (Ok I admit I added that last part) 

Info: 

Date: Jan 13-14
Location: Rainbow Basin Natural Area/ Owl Canyon Campground 
Cost: $20 
We’ll provide telescopes (so we can see stars!!), food, gas, camping gear, etc. 
Just bring a sleeping bag, necessities, and camping gear if you have it
If you’re willing to drive that would be awesome and appreciated! (Plus your fee will be waived)

7wenpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/7wenpo/can_x_major_take_cs_classes_the_answer_is_yes/,"""Can 'x' major take CS classes?"" The answer is yes.",42,7,2018-02-09 08:39:29,"This is probably one of the most repeated posts I've seen on this subreddit every time enrollment rolls around. The answer is yes. For CS 31 and 32, if you're one of the following majors Ling&amp;CS, Pre CS B, C&amp;S Biol, Pre Math/Com, Math/Com, or your minor is Bioinfo then you can enroll on myUCLA. Otherwise you fill out a special petition specifically for CS 31 and 32(just change the 31 to 32 in the link) here http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/enroll/31/ which also has the same information people just regurgitate every time someone asks this question. 

But the big question is why do you want to take CS 31/32?

More often than not it's a Stats major that asks this question because they want to get some experience with coding which I understand is very beneficial for disciplines like data science. But ask yourself if you need to specifically take CS 31/32 which teaches C++. If you're a stats major, courses in R are already available to you and python is offered by the PIC department. Both of these languages are far better suited for data science than C++. If you're learning to code because someone said it's a good idea, while I agree with them it is a good idea, ask yourself if C++ is one of those languages you should be learning. Realistically, it isn't.

If for some reason you still think you should learn C++ considering taking the PIC 10 series. The material is nearly identical and at a slower pace. While CS 31 and 32 is tailored for beginners, it also serves the dual purpose of transitioning into looking at CS as a scientific discipline rather than just learning a bunch of languages. That's because a lot of what happens in the CS curriculum emphasizes theory more than just coding. Yes, CS 31/32 are essentially computer programming classes, but they're designed to ease students into computer science classes. Read [this](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/137103/whats-the-difference-between-computer-science-and-programming) if you're still confused. This is a pretty good quote the explains the gist of the debate. 

&gt;Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes. - Edsger Dijkstra

While the material is the same, the purpose of the courses are different. CS 31/32 are about getting students ready for upper div computer SCIENCE courses  while PIC 10 is more for just exposing students to the basics of PROGRAMMING with less regard for the theoretical aspects of the topic.

7ys3zp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/7ys3zp/i_cant_help_but_feel_its_all_meaningless/,I can't help but feel it's all meaningless.,37,13,2018-02-19 17:33:25,"Hello, 
I'll give a bit of context here and simply explain that I'm a third year transfer student. Given all the hype surrounding the school, I did not think it was unreasonable to expect a great quality education with an environment that would challenge me and prepare me for the next phase in my career. After all, it's UCLA, right? 

Of course, as you all know, reality bit hard. I can't help but feel that instructional quality was much better at my community college. I'm practically teaching myself all my courses this quarter and I'm sure it won't be the last time. I have all but lost hope of ever achieving an A in any class due to the way the grading works here, whereas I thought grading was more fair and achievable at CC. Not only that, why do professors insist on writing midterms that most of the class will not have time to finish? I've studied for hours and hours only to find that the midterm material resembles neither the book work nor the lecture work. I may have well never studied and my score would have been just the same. I cannot fathom what about this setup makes UCLA such a ""great"" school. I can't help but feel like this is all a waste of my time, or that I could've had a richer academic experience going to a CSU rather than choosing the name brand. 

I've also faced ""discrimination"" in the sense that most everything I've applied for, whether it's a job or position on campus tends to go to students who have been here longer, despite my qualifications. I have this huge dissonance between how friendly and acommodating UCLA claims to be for transfer students while at the same time not experiencing any of that welcome or accomodation. I feel like the people in charge of these jobs or positions aren't giving me a chance to work because I'm new to the school and nearly done. I understand this may be a false perception, but I can't help but have this ""vibe"" from the school. 

I understand that not everyone will feel this way, and I say, good. I wish I could feel the same way. Unfortunately, I do not. I have one more year left where I just have to power through and get my degree. But please tell me, is it just me who feels this way? Or are there others? 
I mean, why study so hard when you won't get the A anyway? 
Why go to class if the professor can't lecture? 
Why try to ""get involved"" if you'll be outcasted for not being here longer? Really, what was the whole point of coming to UCLA? 

Again, I apologize for ranting, but this is getting really frustrating and really annoying and just want to have a general discussion. Call me right, call me wrong, just please say something.

832cf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/832cf7/i_am_a_ucla_student_addicted_to_watching_internet/,I am a UCLA student addicted to watching internet porn.,55,19,2018-03-08 16:04:14,"The point of this thread is that I am trying to reach out and connect with other students who may be struggling with this issue as well. Here is a summary of my story.

I watched porn for the first time when I was 4 years old. I had no idea what watching. The only thing I knew was that it was exciting, so I kept doing it. I now realize it was traumatic to be watching porn as a kindergartner. For the next 15 years of my life, I watched porn regularly. By the time I entered high school, I was watching nearly everyday. I used things I had heard people say throughout the years like “all guys watch porn” as a rationalization for my behavior. Then, towards the end of high school I tried to change my ways and give up porn. However, nothing I did on my own to quit worked. 

I sought out help from nobody, keeping this part of my life secret. The shame I felt about my behavior was intense. I thought I was a perverted, shitty, weak person. And yet, on some level I still thought I could fix my issue all on my own. This did not work, and time and time again I found myself back on those explicit sites. I became suicidal, thinking that I’d never be able to quit, and that the only way out of this addictive cycle was to end my life. After two years on my own I hit bottom, crossing boundaries in my sexual behavior that went against my concept of morality. I broke through my denial, admitted I had a serious issue, and reached out for help, first through CAPS. I was diagnosed by a therapist there as a sex addict, and was referred to a recovery group for sexually addicted persons.  

Watching porn for 15 years growing up fucked with my brain, and I needed time to heal. I was sex obsessed, misogynistic, antisocial and I hated myself. For the first 6 months of recovery, I couldn't get more than 30 days away from porn. At the time of this writing however,  I have 5 months of continuous sobriety from pornography and masturbation. I have never been happier in my life. I can actually look myself in the mirror and not feel repulsed. This is thanks wholly to unconditional love I have received from the other members of the group I joined that are also trying to attain sobriety from pornography. I never could've done this on my own. 

So back to the point of this post. I am writing this to offer that same support to anybody out there reading this who may be struggling with pornography and / or other unhealthy compulsive sexual behaviors. There is help out there for this kind of issue, you don’t have to go about it alone. Please message me. My goal is to eventually create a group of students on campus who meet weekly to support each other to recover from sexual addiction. This painful part of your life no longer has to be your darkest secret. If you are not sure whether or not compulsive use of pornography is an issue for you, simply try going 30 days without watching any kind of porn. If you can’t do it, then you may be like me. At that point please consider reaching out to me and sharing your story or going to CAPS. There is no shame in asking for help. Be courageous, be fearless. It won't be easy to do it, but it may be the kindest thing you could ever do for yourself. 

You can contact me via PM or at supersecretucla@mail.com. I assure you I will not share your contact information with anybody, and that your identity will remain anonymous. 

Note: To those of you who may think that porn is not addictive, that is a scientific debate I am not interested in having. All I know is that I couldn’t stop on my own, and that I need help to quit. This experience has been reaffirmed by the hundreds men and women I’ve met over the past year in various meetings and sexual recovery groups whose lives mirror mine.

8c4um1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/8c4um1/why_i_regret_attending_ucla_2nd_year_business/,Why I regret attending UCLA. 2nd year business economics major,70,39,2018-04-13 19:59:15,"With all of the prospective freshmen on Reddit, I wanted to give my perspective on my two years at UCLA. My experience may differ radically from others' experiences, but I want to be able to share all perspectives as a UCLA student. 

I'm a 2nd year business economics student. My GPA is pretty good (around a 3.8+ GPA). I really had the highest of hopes when I first attended UCLA. Perhaps it's my fault that I held UCLA at such a high standard that I was continuously disappointed as the year went on. In any case, I'll be directing my experience with regards to the Economics department.

UCLA has so many great departments: engineering, mathematics, biology, and so on. Economics is definitely not one of them. In fact, I'd place the Econ department as one of the worst departments at UCLA. Teachers are gravely incompetent, material taught is mostly unrelated to exams and future jobs, and the class sizes are just ridiculous. With the exception of Professor Rojas, every single Econ professor I've had was a terrible lecturer, a condescending figure, a  stubborn old man/woman, or all of the above. There's almost no way to get help if you are lost because either the TA's are swamped with other students or they are not kept in the loop by the professor. Class sizes of 300 students and over certainly do not help. Some students are just destined to fail, and professors just let it happen.

The job opportunities as a ""business"" major are slim at UCLA. People often hear that UCLA graduates work at top-ranked banks and investment firms. Yes, that's true, but usually only if you are part of UCLA's exclusive business clubs. Bruin Asset Management, Bruin Consulting, Delta Sigma Pi, and other organizations set their members up for success. That's great, but it's not so great when only 4% of applicants get accepted each quarter. The recruiting process is entirely subjective and is determined by fellow students who are fully capable of being judgmental and biased. I'm not the most social person, but that doesn't mean that I don't want to work in finance. But because of the way UCLA's business clubs and organizations are structured, I will most likely never have the opportunity to work in finance at a major bank or corporation. 

The one thing I will say is that if you are 100% sure that you want to go into accounting, then go to UCLA. UCLA is definitely a school that firms look at when recruiting for internships and full time positions. UCLA = U C a Lot of Accountants. 

When I applied to 7 business clubs my sophomore year (Fall 2017) and was rejected by every single one, I felt worthless and pathetic. I felt like nothing and fell into a deep depression. I managed to finish the quarter on a strong note, but the life and inspiration inside me was gone. It took all of winter break and part of Winter Quarter to figure out why I was feeling so lonely and pathetic. 

I won't go into too much detail about my therapy, but at the end of the process, I found a newfound focus, to transfer colleges entirely. I've already been accepted to some safety schools that are deemed far less prestigious than UCLA, but I will go to those schools if needed. My mental health is more important than any kind of academic or professional success. 

In general, I feel like I've wasted my time here. I will never be able to pursue my professional goals in this environment. It's just not the right fit for me. I have friends and a good support system around me, but for my own sake, I NEED to go somewhere else. Everything I have done these past two years have lead up to absolutely nothing. 

Sorry if I may have spooked out all of the freshmen. I may be the odd one out of the bunch, but I did feel that I needed to get my story out there. It's my last quarter here, and I am so happy that it is. "

I had a lot of friends in high school and I never had to make much of an effort, but for some reason college has not been the same. 
   
  

I've had friends for a few months at UCLA but nothing that has developed into anything more than a very superficial friendship.  Now when my UCLA 'friends' message me its just because they need me to help them with their homework, or because they want me to get them something; I've pretty much stopped talking to these people because it feels like I'm just being taken advantage of — which leads me to where I am now.  I still have friends from high school that I keep in touch with, but it is such a bummer to have literally zero real friends that I can hang out with or study with here.
    



 I feel like in a university this big, its hard for introverted people to find a group to hang out with because when your friends find someone that's more engaging, more interesting and more available than you are, you'll just slowly drop out of their lives.  
    



It can also feel pretty isolating and intimidating if you're not a member of one of the predominant racial groups at UCLA because it seems like nearly everyone hangs out with their respective racial clique.  Asians with Asians, Whites with Whites, etc.  
    

I don't know what my options are.  If anyone has some advice I'd love to hear it.

It has been brought to my attention that there are some users out there who feel I am “toxic” so here I am making it up even though I don’t have to since I did absolutely nothing wrong in the first place, but I digress. 

I’ll start by acknowledging the mod’s comment on my rant about my posts getting removed. You were correct about which posts should have been removed. Perhaps you are not as much of a shitstain as I had initially thought. I am thoroughly impressed. 
Speaking of shitstains, I have recently noticed a trend where bathroom stalls have been rendered unusable because there is literally a steaming pile of shit on top of the toilet seat. So, being the wholesome true bruin that I am, my advice here for the bois is to carefully aim the trajectory of your urine on the side of the poop so that it gets pushed into the toilet bowl. Saves you AND the cleaning staff trouble. As for the ladies – sorry, you’re shit out of luck. 

Next, when eating in the dining halls, make sure to wait for two plates/bowls of whatever food item you are lining up for first before taking the one with the biggest portions. It is spring and people are working on their summer bodies, so by denying them of the one they want, you are effectively helping them to reach their goal by minimizing their calorie intake. And because they eat less, the size of their poop is smaller, which in turn means you need less urine in order to clean away the recent shit storm. That’s right – it all comes full circle. 

Finally, my last advice is for when you see a lazy bruin straight out of winter hibernation riding a Bird/Lime scooter. Get their attention so that they pull over, and then ask them where the graduate school of oceanography is. They will likely pull out their phones to google maps it because they don’t know that such a garbage STEM program doesn’t even exist here, so that’s when you hop on the scooter and ride away. Congratulations, you just prevented a possible future accident from an idiot who was 100% likely to not be wearing a helmet and was riding on the sidewalk instead of the road. Make sure you ride it out for as long as possible, because they more money that person loses, the more likely s/he will learn from this lesson. And whatever amount of money you make them waste will certainly be significantly lower than the ticket they were going to get from the cops anyways. 

“But 420Spook420, what about the calories you gain from taking people’s food or the trouble you get in for stealing a person’s scooter when you yourself don’t have a helmet?” I am first and foremost a utilitarian in every sense of the word – I always sacrifice myself for the greater good. A mere additional 300 calories or a $200 ticket means nothing in the long run so long as my actions benefit another individual, even if s/he doesn’t realize or acknowledge it. I know not everyone is suited for this wholesome lifestyle, but these are just a few of my tips on how we can make our community great again.

Read everything up to the line. If you want to be very brief, read only the 4 questions and TL;DR answers. I tried to make this shorter but there is a lot of ground to cover. 

Most people commenting on the strike in this subreddit are probably not completely informed about the strike. While I'm aware that the strikes are ending later today, I'd like to correct any misinformation floating around so that people are fully and properly informed about the strike so that they can accurately evaluate the strike and form their own educated opinion. I'd like to be clear when I say that **this post is not meant, entirely, as a defense of the strike**, but most information in this sub has been biased against the strike. Therefore, corrections of this misinformation may be seen as pro-strike. For transparency's sake, I do personally support the strike in some areas, while not supporting some areas of the strike's methodology and some of the reasoning behind the strike. Again, the purpose of this post is generally to correct misinformation, not to take a side. Misinformation is centered around the following questions:

1. Why are the strikes happening?
2. Where would the money for the proposed wage increase come from?
3. How much do employees actually make?
4. Why should I care (or not care)?

**TL;DR answers:**

1. Racial and gender-based gaps in representation and in wages as well as the outsourcing of labor. Concerns have also been raised regarding the wages matching employees’ living needs on many fronts. The UC's plans to address these concerns prior to the strikes have not been effective. Thus, the strike.
2. From outsourced employees that would no longer be hired as often as before, lowered increases in wages for very high wage earners, and a decrease in legal payouts resulting from ineffective UC policies regarding sexual harassment prevention, among other things..
3. Assuming a **40 hour work week** and **52 work weeks a year**, from **$36k to $37.5k** starting rate for common service positions, on average. In addition, employees at UCLA likely **face far greater necessary living needs compared to others in California** due to their employment in Westwood and likely housing near Westwood, a particularly affluent part of California (and even LA). This should be considered when making judgments about the amount of money workers make and what they are asking for.
4. Generally, workers at UCLA are members of the community too, so thinking about and talking about their issues is something that is important. Read the in-depth section for many smaller reasons to care about the workers at UCLA.

Please don’t comment on any of the TL;DR points without reading the in-depth answers first, since the in-depth answers may cover issues that you have.

Read onwards if you would like to see in-depth information regarding any of the touched on points above. 
**************************
**In-Depth Answers**

From here on out, AFSCME 3299, the union organizing the strike, shall be referred to as “the 3299”. A report and update from the 3299 as well as some income stats are referred to throughout this section and are only linked in-text the first time they are referenced. These sources are listed at the bottom of the post for your convenience.

**Question 1: Why are the strikes happening?**

Most of those posting in the UCLA subreddit regarding the strikes have assumed that the strikes are solely about the desired 6% wage step increase across the board per year per employee (compared to the offered 2% by the UC). This is simply not true. If one looks at the 3299's [most recent bargaining update](https://afscme3299.org/bargaining-update/), one can see that the 3299's other demands include retirement benefits, healthcare benefits, and job security. If one delves a bit deeper to the [3299's full report](https://afscme3299.org/documents/reports/Pioneering-Inequality_WhitePaper.pdf) (warning, slow load, dense read), one can also see other reasons for the strike, including race and gender representation and wage disparity represented in a pretty clear-cut way. In addition, the 3299 cites more than $3.4 million spent on sexual harassment payouts, which they also criticize. This post will not be a commentary on the politics of gender and race disparity in the UC system, which, as far as I am concerned, is **much better** than what can be seen in other employment sectors, but leaves some areas for improvement, which the 3299 identifies. The 3299 also criticizes the lack of efficacy shown by the UC as a whole in carrying out past commitments meant to fix wage payment issues (not enough wages to be considered a living wage, not getting paid for work hours, etc.) through a plan known as FW/FW or Fair Wage/Fair Work. To avoid diving too deep into FW/FW, a criticism by the 3299 that jumps out immediately is that 7/10 UC campuses have not obtained any valid certifications showing that they meet the UC's own goals in implementing FW/FW. Clearly, the belief seen in most of the posts in this subreddit assuming that the strike has been solely about wages is mistaken.

**Question 2: Where would the money for the proposed wage increase come from?**

Many posters in this subreddit assume that all costs associated with the 3299's demands would be pushed onto the student body. This is untrue. In the above report from the 3299, they cite a wage gap between the top 10% of wage-percentage earners and the bottom 50% of wage-percentage earners, with the gap increasing dramatically over the period from 2005 to 2015. This would likely be one of the larger areas targeted in correcting this gap and in increasing the wages of workers. Additionally, the 3299 cites the frequency with which the UC hires outsourced labor for jobs that UC employees could do instead. This is where a smaller portion of the increase would come from. The 3299 also cites over $3.4 million spent on sexual harassment payouts, a higher amount than any other state agency and more than the UC has ever spent before on a yearly basis. By improving training meant to prevent or lessen the need for these payouts, the money could be used to increase wages instead. Many posters have made assumptions that all funding for wage increases would come directly from student pockets; this is false. While it is undeniable that students would bear a portion of the costs for this increase, the 3299's criticisms largely center on other ares that would bear a sizable portion of the cost as well. 

**Question 3: How much do employees actually make?**

Doing some **very simple math** seen in the TL;DR answer, assuming a 40 hour work week and 52 work weeks a year, workers make $36k to $37.5k as a starting rate for common service positions, on average. Some posts have asserted that this rate is already high enough, and that any further desire for wage increases is unwarranted. This is mostly untrue. When looking at [median household income](https://datausa.io/profile/geo/westwood-ca/) in Westwood, this yearly salary seems comparable, but when factoring in the fact that employees most likely don't live in Westwood (Westwood has a very low population comprised almost entirely of students), and looking at the median household income for areas outside Westwood (Los Angeles as a whole is about $54k per household), this criticism loses some weight. This is also considering **full time employment** for **52 weeks a year, with no breaks**. Another issue that I find with posters in the subreddit is that posters will often misrepresent those working at UCLA as entry-level workers who have no intent to go beyond that entry-level. However, as seen in the 3299's update post, some of their central bargaining demands are for retirement benefits to be increased and for the pension plans to be made more stable, not behavior one would associate with entry-level employment. Workers at UCLA want long-term prospects for employment and for their eventual retirement, not to make a killing off of improperly inflated wages and to use their position as a stepping stone to a ""mid-level"" job. To many UCLA workers, this is the job that they intend to retire after, and the demands that the 3299 makes and the statistics that they cite support this conclusion. Most of the above also applies to workers in the entire UC system, not just UCLA, but my response is centered around UCLA due to most of the posts in the subreddit being about UCLA in this regard.

**Question 4: Why should I care (or not care)?**

A small-scale impact on those affected by the strike brings great attention to a cause which would, if successful, improve the lives of those striking (in the UC as a whole, not just UCLA) demonstrably. In addition, the strike makes those who would otherwise not even think about the lives of the workers at UCLA take a step back and think about people they interact with every day. Any amount of introspection brought on by the strikes is a success in that it facilitates further thinking about the kind of community we want to be towards those who work for us constantly. As a community, having pride towards and support for our workers is worth considering when one thinks about how much pride we hold towards our athletes, students, and professors. The workers at UCLA are as much a part of the community as you are, so showing them an equal amount of deference that you would expect for yourself is important to bear in mind.

Incoming freshman here and let me just say I haven’t been able to properly be happy about my acceptance. 

I am the only person from my school who got accepted (and around 20+ kids applied. about half with better grades than me). And the only genuine congratulations I’ve received are from people I’m not even really close to. 

My friends were eh about it. Most didn’t even say congratulations they just said “I hate Los Ángeles” or something like “goood luck living in the city”. One of my friends even asked me if I got in, i said yes and she just turned away from me. 

And my counselors are mad that I got in (they have their favorites and I’m not one of them). And so many parents have been talking crap about UCLA to my mom saying stuff like “it used to be a good school” “yeah their reputation is ruined because of the immigrants” “yeah I’m glad my kid didn’t get in. that school sucks right now”. 

And I can’t even wear UCLA merch without someone saying a snide remark about the school. 

Really the only people who have been happy for my is my immediate family and I guess that’s enough but it hurts to see teachers, counselors, and even my friends genuinely congratulate my peers while I get no warm sentiments. 

Anyone else just,,,, well just not have those around you support you ;("

I don't support the strike neither should you. HEAR ME OUT BEFORE THE INSTANT DOWNVOTE. The other thing is, we are the ones paying for it. I can't find an exact numbers on their pay and what they want exactly, but its a 20% pay raise over 3 years, they earn above market wages according to the uc spokes woman who commented on this.
So this is what the ucla job posting for cook in the dining services would get paid, I have some family who I just talked to about this that work here. This is only starting. This is for cook's in the dinning halls which are the ones who are on strike, this is the website for finding out ucla workers pay. Its a wide range, this includes groundskeepers and janitors, etc. If you work full time and are here for over 5-10 years you have room for both advancement and its MOST DEFINITELY A LIVING WAGE.
Look. You can say that they should be paid a nice 50k(which many if not most are who work full time in food services, and after a number of years even custodial and groundskeeping). If your trying to convince me a job that doesn't require a degree with no prior or little experience is required. Should earn more than the proposed minimum wage of 15$ an hour(Which again. MOST DO) then good fucking luck.
Oh and 20% spread out over about 3k workers(roughly) ends up way more than 1000 dollars for the entire student body. Con. Fucking. Grate. To. Us.
So lets do the math. assume that the avg individual is earning about 35k-40k which I can believe and is about the avg numbers I'm seeing. its 7500 for each individual worker spread out over 3 years. We have about 3000 full time staff who are custodians, cooks, food service, maintenance, labor, etc. on strike. its about 2275000 million that will have to be passed onto the students. Each one of us get to pay about 568 dollars for a position that is paid more than others in the same city."

Do not commit for this program, the math department is tearing it apart because they're salty. Dean Miguel Garcia-Garibay, Chair William Duke, Vice Chair Don Blasius don't be petty.

""An Open Letter to the Provost and Vice Provost from Bruin Actuarial Society: 

Dear Vice Provost Turner and Provost Waugh:

Bruin Actuarial Society, an undergraduate student organization of over 200 members interested in the actuarial career, is deeply concerned about developments that have taken place over the past two quarters at the Department of Mathematics. These changes will have detrimental effects on the education of students in the Actuarial Program. We hope to explain a sequence of events that show that Dean Garcia-Garibay, Chair Duke, and Vice Chair Blasius are playing university politics at the expense of students’ education.

On Jan. 23rd, 2018, Chair Duke informed the actuarial lecturer Prof. Kong that he and all other actuarial lecturers are to be dismissed at the end of Spring Quarter because of “union rules” limiting how long non-tenured instructors may teach at UCLA. This triggered an investigation by the AFT into their unfair dismissal under false pretenses. By the end of the week, the reason for their firing expanded to include “poor student reviews.” This began a sequence of ever-changing reasons provided by the Dean, the Chair, and the Vice Chair for the dismissal of the esteemed professors. There was no desire for input from FAM students, nor any effort to notify students of the firings before they become fait accompli at the end of the school year.

On Feb. 26th, Vice Chair Blasius informed the Actuarial Council, a group of stakeholders including officers of BAS, that the FAM major is undergoing “curriculum change” to be oriented towards, at various times in our ongoing communication with him, “data science,” “machine learning,” “data analysis,” and finally, “actuarial science and finance.” They are firing all actuarial lecturers because they want PhDs with research interests in the field to teach our actuarial courses. The “curriculum change” is scheduled to be effective as of Summer Session, but as of May 7th, the professors with research interests in the fields of actuarial science and finance are nowhere to be found. Again, there was no desire for input from FAM students, nor the least effort to notify students of any of these developments.

Prof. Blasius also expressed on Feb. 26th how he believes that in the future, teaching material on the actuarial exams should be a service provided by Bruin Actuarial Society to its members. He does not understand that quite literally all actuarial science is by nature tested on the actuarial exams. This is the equivalent of the Anderson School firing all CPAs who teach accounting courses, replacing them with economics postdocs, and then telling the Student Accounting Society to teach the CPA exams to its members. We would like to remind Professor Blasius that our members are not paying tuition to learn actuarial science from fellow undergraduates, and the officers of BAS are not paying tuition to learn actuarial science on their own so that they can teach their fellow students. At this point, the Vice Chair took to pettiness, proactively asking the Undergraduate Advisor Connie Jung to un-invite BAS from tabling with the Department of Mathematics at Bruin Day as we have done for as long as we can remember.

Naturally, members of BAS were concerned with these changes. On Mar. 8th, an officer of the society, Kevin Zhu, met with Prof. Duke to obtain reassurances on behalf of our members, primarily (1) that all students in the Program would be able to graduate with their FAM degrees on time and (2) that actuarial courses would continue to prepare students to pass the actuarial exams on which our future careers depend. Prof. Duke first remarked that he found it odd for students to want a say in curriculum and that the dismissal of the actuarial lecturers was none of students’ business. Next, he asked us to ignore what Vice Chair Blasius said on Feb. 26th, as the Vice Chair’s words supposedly do not “represent the Department’s intentions.” He answered our questions with mild reassurances but refused to put anything in writing or notify students, lest we “hold him to it before details were finalized.” After the meeting, Kevin attempted to summarize in an email to Prof. Duke what they had discussed, thinking that the reassurances we sought were agreed upon. Prof. Duke contradicted Kevin’s account and wrote “Let me succinctly explain what I attempted to convey to you...” followed by the vaguest generalizations and half-reassurances.

The officers of BAS met with Dean Garcia-Garibay at his invitation during Finals Week of Winter Quarter. While he attempted to reassure us, there were notable inconsistencies that remain on our minds. The Dean said that despite the great success the program has sustained in its current format, its strength is ""unsustainable"" and the actuarial lecturers must be fired and replaced with faculty with ""actuarial research interests"" to maintain its success, yet these researchers are nowhere to be seen. The Dean stated that BAS has been a big contributor to the Program’s success and should therefore help bring in actuaries to speak at weekly “actuarial practicums”, where professionals will come to campus and speak and network with various snacks. We would like to make clear that it is not the job of a student-run club to recruit speakers for the Department, and more importantly, that it would be a tall order to find an actuary in the country who has not heard of and been thoroughly repulsed by the actions of the administration.

The Dean then showed us a revised version of FAM major requirements, including new courses with vague names like “Math 178A: Foundations of Actuarial Mathematics A.” The syllabi for six new courses and modifications to several existing courses, due to be implemented by Fall, are nowhere to be seen. The syllabi created by our actuarial professors for long-standing courses like Math 173AB: Casualty Loss Models teach a wealth of actuarial knowledge. We have not the slightest clue what six new actuarial courses would contain, and frankly, we do not think the Dean knows either. On May 2nd, we asked the Dean, the Chair, and the Vice Chair for updates, including syllabi and the qualifications of the incoming professors. They have not responded, and Prof. Blasius notified us that he will not be attending the Council Meeting today, May 7th, where this topic was on the agenda.

Over the past two decades, the actuarial professors and Bruin Actuarial Society together have created from scratch one of the most well-respected and heavily-recruited actuarial programs in the country. The Dean, Chair, and Vice Chair made the decision to fire the actuarial professors for some reason of their own and then produced countless more, one after another: union rules, poor student reviews, “curriculum reform,” an aim to bring in professors with research interests in actuarial math, and making the Actuarial Program more “respectable to industry.” What they have done is to disregard our professors’ decades of service, stonewall a student-run club acting in our members’ best interest, confuse and panic hundreds of students, and repulse the entire community of actuaries. Countless disgusted actuarial students, alumni, and donors have flooded the inboxes of the Dean, Chair, and Vice Chair over the past months with outraged letters to little response or explanation. A Daily Bruin article on the matter was published on May 2nd to universal negative reaction on social media.

Professors Turner and Waugh, we chose to become actuarial students at UCLA because of the opportunities afforded by this Program. Shame on Professors Garcia-Garibay, Duke, and Blasius for abdicating their responsibility towards the Program that brought us to UCLA"""

I'm not really close to Ben, but he seems like a good guy. I've seen him around in a few classes but I never really got to know him.

""Hey Ben"" I said to Ben. 

""Hey 420spook420,"" Ben said to me.

Ben looked at me and smiled. I felt the warmth of his smile. His smile was something else. I could've sworn every time Ben smiles a child is born in the world, somewhere.

""Ben, I want to kiss you,"" I said to Ben.

Before all of you start complaining that this is some sort of erotica, this is NOT. I've written erotica regarding numerous figures here at UCLA and rest assured, this is not the path that I will go down today. First of all, erotica doesn't start off with something as soft as just a kiss I guarantee you that. I'm not sure what you do with your ""bros"" or with your ""homies"" but this is literally what I do with my friends. I wanted Ben to be my friend and this is 420spook420's fool-proof method to make friends. Take notes, fellow Bruins.

""Haha, what?"" Ben said to me. 

""I said I want to kiss you Ben,"" I said to Ben.

Ben glared at me. He had a half smile not sure about what to make of the situation. He hardly knew me, for christ's sake.
But in that moment, everything felt so right. Ben looked like a million dollars, and while I felt nothing but pure friendship between me and Ben, I really wanted to kiss Ben.

""But 420spook420, what will you do when your other friends find out?"" Ben said to me. 

I looked at my hands and started sobbing. I sobbed uncontrollably, and I am a really ugly crier. 

""You are a really ugly crier,"" Ben said to me.

I couldn't take it anymore. I cried harder and harder, putting my feet up to the chair and rested my face into my knees. I shook uncontrollably. 

But in a moment, I felt a hand touch my face. It was a warm hand, full of creases and bumps that just felt so right. It was Ben's hand. 

He grabbed me by the cheek and he kissed me.

Not sure if it was my last post, but fellow bruins, we are coming together as a more wholesome community."

So I'm in this class with my friend and the professor emphasized multiple times that the exam will cover both the lecture slides AND the readings. Of course, a lot of people scoff at the thought of reading but after hearing the professor mention it many times, I was pretty damn sure you needed to be doing the readings to do well. 

Well my friend over here assured me all the time that ""we don't need to do any readings"" and that he never did any of the readings and that reading is for tryhards and it's a waste of time when everything you need to know is on the slides. In fact, he kinda laughed at the fact that I spent money on buying the books. 

Well, come exam time and what do you know...it's 100 Multiple-Choice questions and literally 20-30 questions are things that you would know if and only if you actually did the readings. Sure there were maybe a handful (~5-10 questions) that the professor brushed up on during lecture but other than that, there was no way you could guess 20 questions, answer choices A-E, correctly without being extremely lucky or reading the book. I read so I knew most of it so I got a 93/100 but somehow my friend got a 99/100 ""without ever reading"" while the average was around a 75-77%. Sounds kinda suspicious to me e.e

Moral of the story, pay attention in class and do what you're required to do. Don't skimp out on doing something just because your friend tells you that ""you don't need to do it"" because I'm positive that if I didn't do those readings, I would've bombed that "

So here's the deal. I was assigned a triple, which is far from what I wanted originally, after not being able to secure a single. And I decided to stick with it because of the price difference. After all, it would create a greater burden for my folks financially if I had a single or double, so I just decided to take the cheaper option. Oh well, not a big deal. 

The only problem is that part of the reason I wanted a single was for privacy. I'm into anime and other obscure Japanese things and also happen to own a Waifu pillow (or 抱き枕, for my Japanese Bruins; I’m actually trying to learn Japanese btw). It's not that I'm into weird stuff or anything, I just wanted to be able to hang up my anime posters and figurines and have my pillow with me without feeling embarrassed and self-conscious about it around my roommates. I mainly use the pillow for comfort when I sleep.

I know UCLA is progressive and open-minded, but I can't shake the feeling that my roommates will judge and make fun of me behind my back for sleeping with a Dakimakura. I’m really hoping I don’t get roomed with a couple of judgmental Chads, but I honestly don’t know what to expect. And it’s making me nervous to think that I’ll have a couple of wannabe frat bros who don’t understand my interests and will try to put me down for them.

Also, I have one of the more graphic and sexually suggestive waifu pillows. I don't want my roommates being offended at the sight of it every time they walk in the room. That's why I thought it would be best if I took the top bunk so that they wouldn't have to stare at it since it would be out of their eye sight. In addition, any guests we have over would not have to see it either. 

Do you guys think I should even bring it? I love my waifu pillow dearly and can't imagine myself sleeping without if I’m being totally honest.

I guess my question is: Is UCLA Dakimakura friendly?

I’m a rising second year female in cs. I’m incredibly unhappy at ucla and I feel like our school is so performative about being happy and fun that I’m ashamed of even being sad. 

For me, most of my time in Westwood has been so uneventful. There’s nothing to do in the area unless you go Greek like any other school, and I don’t have a car that I can take around la. I also haven’t adjusted to la well as it just feels like suburbs and endless traffic. Our campus feels smaller and smaller everyday and the magic of seeing Royce and Powell has completely gone away for me.

Most of my friends and classmates are nice but aren’t really invested in classes even though theyre also in stem. What bugs me is that so many of them shit on humanities majors and can’t stop degrading kids at other schools. People being presumptuous here feels like the norm and it’s so tiring. 

I actually cried at Bruin Day this year out of stress. I saw the band playing and all the cheerleaders and all the ucla gear and felt...creeped out? Everyone smiling and parading around campus - like ucla turned into a scene from Get Out? I’m not doing well in classes no matter how hard I try and everything this school markets itself to be just doesn’t feel right to me.

I’m from Sacramento and I miss my family there a lot. I don’t like thinking back on things but I genuinely wish I got into Berkeley just so I could be near them and get to study cs there. My mom is low income and I want to be there for her while also working to get my degree. I’m even considering withdrawing for a quarter or more to see if I can snag a developing gig and work from home. I don’t know I’m so lost. 

What resources do we have on campus for someone like me? Am I really that abnormal to feel this way? Can anyone offer advice about withdrawing, please?"

Big corporate-owned apartments and small-time landlord apartments can be equally good (or bad).

Despite lacking a mere 12 or 16 credits to graduate myself, earn my History Degree, and move on forward through my life with no blaring regrets, I choked. I failed all but one of three Spring courses, earning a D in the exception. After dropping a class in Winter, an Incomplete turned F and B+ made up my grades that quarter. Before those quarters, my cumulative GPA while at UCLA was above a 3.5. I accepted that although I couldn't fully realize why my life was going wrong, I knew I needed to take a break from school.

It wasn't until fairly recently that I decided to put in some genuine effort to find a way back into UCLA and finish what I started. It was easy to ignore the issue for as long as I did, but as I close in on turning 30 years old the clock is certainly ticking. At least one of my former teachers has been extremely supportive from the very start of the process (unfortunately he wasn't any of the teachers who I needed to convince to let me turn in some very late work). After emailing and quickly hearing back from History Department undergraduate advisor Mr. Paul Padilla, he told me that I needed to immediately contact my Senior Seminar professor Albion Urdank to try and work something out before he decides to retires, and to contact the teacher of a medieval history class I took in Winter, and see if I could work something out with her regarding completing the course late. The two remaining classes, the history of medicine course in Winter and History of Art in Spring, were both taught by teachers no longer employed by UCLA, meaning the best I could hope to do was petition for a late drop. 

After beginning to reach out to these three different groups, I began to think about what my other options were. Here's what I came up with. 

Option 1: Reapplying to the University of Los Angeles as a returning History major. I've been told by more than one UCLA representative that this is indeed my only option at this point at all...reapplying to the university. This is a little disconcerting considering my most recent academic history shows me subject to dismissal back in at the end of Spring quarter four years ago. I'm quite confident in my abilities when it comes to filling out college applications in general, and I believe the re-app would turn into something very nice once I finished it. But my fear of being rejected, and what comes after exhausting that option...really scares me. 

Option 2: Bruin Readmission Program (BRP). I got a flier sometime in June 2016 regarding this program--the BRP--and how it's designed to get students who'd been dismissed from UCLA as a result of poor grades and put them back on track for rejoining university life , getting good grades and ultimately graduating. Although the program seems like its more meant to be utilized on freshmen, sophomores, and juniors (although I see no reason why a graduating senior shouldn't be able to take advantage of it too!) as the first quarter upon your return to school is spent with your fellow BRP group of students, who spend their time after class meeting with peer counselors, attending workshops, and earning B's or better in 3 classes that they're made to enroll in, after which they're finally released from the program's relatively strict schedule/guidelines, no doubt eager to return to the general population of undergrads. I've looked for further info on when this program will be offered next, as I've received no fliers in the mail for Bruin Readmission Program 2017 or 2018. 

Option 3: My final question is regarding trying to get everything sorted out without having to deal with options 1 or 2. The fact remains if I don't get those F's either dropped via petition, in the case of the courses being taught by professors no longer employed at UCLA, and if I can't find a way to convince two other professors to accept assignments that are more than 4 years late to be accepted now with little to offer but an explanation and an apology..."

In high school, I was a nobody (socially speaking), but everyone knew who I was because I was the insane valedictorian who took this many AP's and got X score on ABC standardized test. I'm very reserved and shy, so it's hard for me to make friends, but I had them. Though, I never had a best friend and am a horrible texter, I still joined clubs and had groups of friends I would drift between depending what I was doing (middle school friends, club friends, etc.). However, at UCLA, I was not only a nobody socially, but academically and most importantly... physically. I felt like I did not matter and that nobody would notice if I was gone. Even my roommates, with whom I got along with, never grew close to me. I was always on the outside of things. And I have only made one legitimate friend here and that's because we were the awkward, group-less girls in our orientation group.

I complimented her on her Star Wars shirt, and I discovered we had a mutual love for science, astronomy, art, and movies. We were even in the same exact major. So we instantly hit it off, but as the quarters progressed I started to realized that unlike her, I don't have the capacity, tenacity, or passion to continue to pursue STEM. In senior year, I was obsessed with science, engineering, and mathematics. I actually saw myself doing this for the rest of my life. And at the time, I was happy about that seemingly ultimate fact; however, that was far from the truth. I just fooled myself into thinking it was rightly so.

I found myself constantly exhausted, unhappy, and empty. I no longer found any joy in any of the subjects and hobbies I was ""passionate"" about. It was this pressure and this misery that kept me suspended in an ocean of darkness and doubt. My unhappiness and my insecurities were chained to my very being and the more I struggled to keep my head above water, the more I sunk and the more I became lost.

I started ditching lectures, sleeping less, gaining weight (the food was good though), and losing sight of who I am and who I want to be. It isn't until now that I realize that I got so caught up in the ideals and fantasy of what college is supposed to be like that I never stopped to ask, ""Is this right for me?' In pursuing STEM, I have become so unmotivated and depressed because I felt like I was fucking idiot for staring at my Math 32A final and all of physics and not knowing how to do any of these things.

I am tired of trying my hardest and still failing every single time it counts. I am tired of feeling like a ghost to everybody. I am tired of crying and feeling like I don't matter and don't belong. And I am so damn tired of society's expectations of of me. (I am also tired of walking up and down the Hill). Not everyone is meant to be a neurosurgeon, not everyone can be an international pop star sensation, and not everyone should go to college. 

I hope for me and those like me to not be viewed as failures and deviant for not going to college and having the times of our lives. It's not for everyone. I just can't help but feel like a disappointment to my parents, my high school teachers, and all the people who think so highly of me. 

I'm planning on taking a gap year to figure things out. In the meantime, I hope you all enjoy this coming year at UCLA and make the most of it. Thank you to those who read my entire rant. I know it's pretty long. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I had terrible experiences with UCLA, socially and academically. And I know realize that I got choked up in what society expects of teenagers after high school. For that, I suffered mentally and am pretty bitter about it. Just don't get caught up in what careers seem more prestigious, intellectually superior, and have a bigger paycheck. Dedicate yourselves to what you love doing.

I’m trying to find smth off campus, but I honestly dunno if there is anything left or how far off I’ll have to go.

Was about to pay 5 bucks when I realized it might be a scam because these random guys were selling snacks out of cardboard boxes. Kinda felt like a dick at that point cause I wasn't sure if it was a scam so I just gave them 2 dollars for their trouble and didn't buy anything from them. I looked on Reddit and found that people would sell empty snack boxes out of carts to make money. As a freshman, what are some scams I should avoid?

Big shoutout to B-Plate and Feast which taste like straight up Michelin star joints. I’ve never been more excited to eat at any restaurant, let alone a dining hall. 

I straight up shed real tears when I had the steak from B-Plate a couple days ago. I cried. My table looked at me weird, but I don’t care. This is the life. This place is joy. 

I love UCLA. 

Everyone I’ve met has been so friendly. The school spirit is contagious. The weather is radiant and the city, vibrant. 

I even love the stairs. No pain no gain. Usain Bolt ‘22 for real. 

Sometimes I’ll just catch myself smiling for no reason here. 

Of course, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. I’m well aware of the general drawbacks of this school, as well as the varied experiences of all those who attend.

But I just love this place. I love this school and everybody who goes here. 

And I’m ready for the pace to just pick up. "

It made me realize that I’ve done a ton with UCShip and a lot of people I know don't full advantage of the benefits from outside Ashe itself. I’m starting this thread share my own experiences and also so people can share any other businesses around UCLA that offer free services with UCship insurance.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Got my teeth whitened for free at this spot on Wilshire (Angeleno teeth or something). Found out about it from an Facebook ad and was a little skeptical at first, but I had free time over Spring break so I said why not. The office itself was small and the process hurt like hell, but my teeth were maybe a few shades whiter by the end so I couldn’t complain. Apparently it’s like a $400 value without insurance so no regrets.

&amp;#x200B;

2. The next place I found out about when I was complaining to a friend about my chronic neck pain. Turns out she actually did referrals for this acupuncture office in Beverly Hills. I’ve always been pretty skeptical of acupuncture but she told me it was free and she gets paid for referrals so I figured why not. I ended up making an appointment through her student run instagram page @acupunctureucla and wow was this place a gem. The acupuncture was surprisingly soothing but the best part is that they do these heavenly 60-minute massages for free as well (with insurance) which I’ve been going for regularly and still do. Only problem with this place is that it’s a little far from campus (like 15 minute uber).

&amp;#x200B;

3. Finally the craziest story of all… I actually got $400 for doing basically nothing. There was a facebook posting a while back of this pain clinic that would pay you $400 for coming in and getting prescribed their pain relief creams. The ONLY qualifications were that you had to have UCship and some sort of “pain.” Obviously this had sketchy written all over it but $400 was enough to get me and a friend to go. The office was in the back of a SHOE STORE in Hacienda Heights. We saw a “doctor” and I complained about my neck pain. Then low and behold, within 30 minutes, not only were we still alive but we were each handed an envelope with $400 cash inside. Boom. Free Coachella ticket. Told everybody about it and everyone and their moms went. 2 month later we were notified that this was a fraud of some sort and our insurance information might be in danger. Whoops. I was able to change my information but I had a few friends who didn’t and nothing bad happened to their accounts. Still came out with $400 though. Unfortunately, you can’t do this anymore. But I would probably do it again if I could.

&amp;#x200B;

Please share your experiences! I would love to keep milking my UCShip while I still have it."

I found this new environment is much more tough than I thought.
I have never been to any international school. I self-taught all the required materials(SAT, TOFEL, AP tests etc) so that I've almost never talked with any native speakers. I know it sounds silly but the thing is I'm unprepared. The first day of orientation totally freaked me out. It's like everyone is speaking english and they all speak better than you. Some people speak really fast and sometimes with accent so basically I can only get 80% of what they're talking about. Plus, I'm a bit introverted so it's hard for me to fit in. 
Fortunately, they're good things. Everyone is super super nice and friendly. NSAs are cute and really willing to help. Oh, weather is super lovely as well.
I know that I can't play with friends with same background forever and language barrier is something I have to overcome.

So if you decide to be my language exchange parter, there're something I can offer: 1. All the things you want to know about China: language, culture, politics, food, what's treading, economy, education, stereotypes of Chinese, poems......everything. I know there're plenty of Chinese in campus you can ask of, but I'll try my best to make sure what you have is first-hand, authentic and interesting. 2. I'm kind of good at math(well, it's bit arrogant to say that in UCLA since everyone is academically well-prepared), I got full score in SAT/SAT2/AP section of math, physics and chemistry and 96 in Math-diagnostics test and have already earn 60 credits by exchanging AP credits. So, if you're freshman like me and struggling with math, I'm pretty confident that I can help you out. 3.I started to do workout this summer and it really helps me a lot. So if you need a partner in gym, you can always call me.

I'am doing stay-through so I'll always be at campus. 
If you're interested, please don't hesitate to contact me."

My dad passed away around week 5 and I recently got sick enough to be hospitalized, the weekend before I have a major midterm for math. My grades have suffered already. 

The classes I’m taking are chem 14A, math 31A, and a GE. I think I can still do reasonably well in the GE, but I’m very worried about 14A and 31A. I haven’t been doing great in Lavelle’s class (first test went fine, second test and midterm I’ve been ~10% below the average). It’s ok if I have to retake later because I’m a Cog Sci major and the rest of the series isn’t required (technically chem 14A is just one option to fulfill a requirement), but I really don’t want to fail this class. If anyone knows where Lavelle’s curve usually falls, please let me know.

31A is more important, because I plan on taking CS classes eventually and I don’t want to fall behind. The first midterm happened the week I found out about my dad, so I made some awful errors and got a 50%. I’ve taken Calc AB &amp; BC in high school, so I know I could’ve done better. There’s a grading scheme for this class which drops the lower grade midterm in exchange for a more highly weighted final and second midterm. I was counting on doing really well, but the midterm is tomorrow and since I’ve been so sick, I’ve barely studied. I’m sure I can do alright without studying, but I’m really trying to do well this time.

If there’s anything you guys can recommend that I can still do, please let me know. I don’t want to have to withdraw from classes this quarter. "

I’m a first year studying business economics, and my home town is Houston, Texas. 

With the first quarter coming to a close, I’d like to share my feelings of my first few months at this school and see what everyone thinks. 

At this school, I just feel.. off. Like something is amiss. 

I guess the best way to describe it is like this-

I had a group of guys that I grew up with back home. An absolutely obnoxious, ridiculous, idiotic band of clowns- but they were my best friends. 

In particular, I had a friend called Jeff. We did absolutely everything together, from cram studying for tests while the teacher was literally passing out the exams, to meeting up at 3 am on a school night and walking to get McDonalds.  I’ve never met a dude who was so similar to me in every aspect and I can’t help but wish he was here. 

I wish everyone was here, so we could watch stupid videos on YouTube instead of studying for the final the next day, just like we used to. I wish we could do all the things just like we used to. 

Finally, I miss my girlfriend back home. Thanks to relatively lenient schedules and a lot of money saved up for plane tickets, I’ve been able to see her a few times so we don’t go insane, but I can’t help but miss her most. 

I keep thinking to myself “This school is nice. But I would be happier if they were all here.” That’s about it. 

To try to combat the feeling of emptiness I feel inside sometimes, I joined a frat, and it was a fantastic decision. Everyone is really great and I love then all. I can’t wait to spend the next few years with them. 

But.. it’s just not same. 

If I’m completely honest, I most look forward to going home for breaks. It makes me happiest. 

Anyone in a similar situation? Sorry for the long post. 

Cheers everyone :)

It's baffling to me how many north campus majors complain about their workload. Is it really that hard to to read a few pages a night? I know some of the texts are complex, but it's pretty obvious that any basic class in math, physics, chem, etc. is more difficult than most, if not all, north campus classes. Just look at the average grades and GPAs . It really doesn't seem fair that their degree carries the same name as ours when we put in double the work and still have worse GPAs on average. I also think south campus majors should have additional academic resources that are geared towards students with tougher workloads. A lot of the generic counselors don't seem to understand just how HARD it is to be a math major at UCLA.

Also, these athletes and their obscene privilege drive me crazy. They think they are superior to us just because they have blue backpacks and play sports. This is an institution of higher learning, not a gym. It makes no sense that athletes get priority enrollment and take all the desirable GEs when they don't even deserve to be here. If anything, athletes should get the last enrollment pass because they don't really care about school anyways. Meanwhile, athletes get unlimited food and hot tub access, wasting the enormous tuition that I pay to be here.

Finally, I have to say that UCLA Dining is unbearably bad. Only at this backwards school would extra avocado be the same price (i.e one meal swipe) as a meatball sub and a drink. Also, the wait times are absolutely out of control. Either UCLA needs to accept fewer students, or they need to install more dining halls because there is no way I should have to wait 20 minutes for coffee. The overcrowding of dining facilities is a joke. I get that many of the employees are unmotivated and/or lazy, so wait times may be bad regardless, but it would definitely help if we had 2-3 more dining halls.

Sorry for this rant but I had to get these complaints off my chest."

Barcelona welcomes Sevilla to Camp Nou for the second leg of the Copa del Rey quarterfinal on Wednesday afternoon, needing a three-goal win to reach the semifinals. Barca will need Lionel Messi to step up and lead the team to earn a comeback and keep their dreams alive.

Here’s how to stream the match live:

Barcelona vs. Sevilla

Date: Wednesday, Jan. 30

Time: 3:30 p.m. ET

Streaming: fuboTV (try for free)

Location: Camp Nou

TV channel: [beIN Sports](https://jafar-barcelona-vs-sevilla-fc.blog4ever.com)

Lionel Messi was rested and did not play at all in the first leg, and he’s expected to start and captain his team on Wednesday. Messi is having one of the best seasons of his career, and he cannot stop scoring goals in the last two months. Luis Suárez is also expected to play more minutes than he did in Seville, and he’s also on a goal-scoring tear.

This is all about Barça’s ability to make a comeback, but Sevilla also deserves credit for how well they played in the first leg and how dangerous they will be at Camp Nou knowing they have a two-goal lead. This will be a fascinating game to watch, and if Barça can advance it’s because Lionel Messi brought his A game.

You could do it instead of the Math 3 series. It was only 2 quarters instead of 3, and would focus on coding! It would fulfill our math requirement, just as Math 3 did. Sounded good to me... So I enrolled in it and completed the series. 

2+ years later, I'm a junior and taking Biology upper divisions now. I find a really cool one called Ecological Restoration, where you have lab at a stream somewhere near campus. It also had 2 professors I have this quarter, and a good grade distribution. Cool! So I click to enroll, and what do you know... Math 3C is listed as a requirement, alongside other bio lower divisions. Not ""Math 3C **or** LS30B,"" just ""Math 3C."" 

Wait... what? Why isn't LS30B listed? After all, it was the EEB department who created this new math and told us it's an alternative to Math 3 and would fulfill the exact same purposes. It was still a calculus class, and it's not like Ecological Restoration would be involving heavy math. 

So I emailed the professor, saying, ""Why isn't LS30B listed? Isn't that still enough math for Ecological Restoration?"" expecting her to give me a PTE. She replies, ""I'll contact the EEB department about that requirement and tell them to enroll you."" Big surprise... They don't enroll me! 

Then I talked to some of my other friends in EEB and realized that some other upper division EEB classes require Math 3C for god knows what reason, too. 

Thanks EEB department, for creating a new math series, telling us it was a great alternative to Math 3C, then not allowing us to enroll in EEB upper divisions because we didn't do math 3C! 

**TL;DR: EEB makes new math, saying ""take this as an alternative to other math!"" --&gt; lots of EEB students happily enroll --&gt; get to upper division and suddenly ""oops you needed the other math to enroll in this!"" --&gt; ??? --&gt; profit!!**"

For me it's gotten to this point where all days melt together, and nothing is either remarkable nor unremarkable. I don't look forward to graduation, but I don't necessarily fear it either- it exists, time will progress, and it will happen. Until then, I'm in this limbo state of sorts. 

I wouldn't say I'm depressed. Last quarter was my best ever academically and I haven't missed a single class this quarter. I have been blessed to find three extremely close friends that I may confide in during my time here. I am aware that my ancestors could only dream of having the opportunities that are afforded to me. But increasingly, I think about how monotonous the past 8 months or so have been, the reality of post-grad (un?)employment life, and I start to get the feeling that maybe this is more or less how things are going to be.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a transfer from LBCC, and a Biochemistry major.  I withdrew from the Fall because I tried to kill myself, and I couldn't keep up after being a week behind.  I came back in the Winter, taking CHEM153C, CHEM153L and PHYS1B. And I'm terrified out of my mind like you have no idea.

&amp;#x200B;

I got a 3% in CHEM153C 1st midterm, and I feel like I'm gonna bomb the upcoming midterm.  Physics I chickened out of the 1st and I'm also mega unsure of the 2nd midterm.  153L I can't even do the lab reports properly and I didn't do so hot on the midterm ( my TA noticed last week that I'm in severe transfer shock).  Like, I know for a fact I am not lazy.  I am not dumb or anything, but god, I feel so isolated on this campus.  All my friends abandoned me, I study my ass off and make killer Cornell notes, but my confidence is so shot to shit.  I want to withdraw but I am afraid my parents will look down on me.  I'm not suicidal; I know after the Fall going out like that is not going to help, but jesus, why is my transition so bad?! I can't even bring myself to study anymore because I just feel like I'm gonna fail.  And I get the material too, but my nerves just destroy my work ethic.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I try to break the ice with people, and I get passive agressiveness or feeling that I annoy them.  I feel so alone in this campus.  I just want this quarter to be over.  I straight up know I am gonna get 3 F's coming into the Spring, totaling my 3.9 GPA from the summer program I was in.  Can I redeem that? I don't care if I have to retake these classes and fail my quarter, I just want this quarter to end so I can tackle it better.  I go to BHS and I think I agree with my psychologist that I came back too early.  

&amp;#x200B;

I just dunno anymore.  Every transfer I talk to say "" oh its normal"" like they're downplaying it, but its so painful on my end.  Like, I feel that their transfer shock is different from mine.  I just want to see the light at UCLA- cause I can't see it."

I haven't left yet and I miss this place already.

My last, hardest final was an 8am on Thursday for French history, and I was stressing hard about it and going to study groups and stuff. Then one morning a few days before, my throat is sore and my head kinda hurts. I think ok, no big deal, just a little cold.

The night before the final I go to bed and wake up at 3am. I run to the bathroom and fuckin vom like crazy. I go back to bed, whole body aching, and fall asleep somehow. It feels like hours go by, and then I wake up at 3:30am. Just layin in bed writhing in the human agony that is the flu.

I keep waking up and falling asleep before I wake up one final time at 5:30 and throw up yet again, before just laying on my bathroom floor in my underwear, pouring sweat and still shivering like crazy. At this point, I can barely stand let alone walk

But the show must go on. So I stay awake, barely able to stand, whole body in total agony, nauseous and taking shallow breaths, and I call an uber at 7:30, and God damn i thought I'd die in that car ride. Every bump in the road felt like death.

I get where I need to go, and it takes me probabaly 30 minutes to walk 50 yards to the room I need to be in. I have to keep stopping and fight off the urge to die/throw up.

But mothetfuckers, I took that final. I did it. I did the damn thing. It probably wasnt great but what the fuck ever, I made it happen.

No matter how bad your finals went, it probably wasnt as bad as mine. Keep your chin up, friends. You got this.

TL;DR: I got a terrible stomach flu the night before an 8am final. You can imagine how bad it was "

I remembered the wise words that my TA once told me:

*Bing was never banned in China. Naïve undergrad. Rent a virtual machine and check.”*

That’s when I realized, the exam was a test all along.  And I had managed to crack the code. I had to rent a linxsrv and check. Under my breath, I muttered the words export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH, and then the following:

cat ~eggert/finalexamanswerkey.txt | less

A chilling wind brushed over my back. After one and a half hours, they had finally managed to turn on the AC in the lecture hall.

I cautiously read through the answer key, slowly copying down the right answers onto my long, thick answer sheet when I hear Eggert scream ***C-s Student Who Is Cheating Off The Answer Key*** in his native emacs tongue. I was in total shock. Shivering, I looked down at the front of the classroom, and watched as Eggert slowly turned his head until it locked onto me. “I will *pkill* you,” he *echoed*. I was frozen at my desk and could only watch as he summoned his stand 「BIRTHPLACE OF THE INTERNET」.

I boelted from my seat, jumping over several unlucky students’ desks and sprinting up the stairs and out of Franz into the Court of Sciences. But I could sense that Eggert was close on my tail. He summoned a dozen copies of himself with calls to pthread_create(), and they proceeded to chase me as I ran towards the mathsci building. I hastily grabbed the door to enter mathsci, when one of the Eggert threads shouted “*chmod a-x MATHSCI DOOR*.” I tried opening the door, but it shouted at me: “Permission denied.” I said “*rm -f door* and ran into the mathsci building.

I ran desperately from the Eggert clones, but soon found myself out of breath, because I’m a CS major and I sit at my desk all day. Suddenly, I saw one of Eggert’s clones run down the hallway. I quickly opened the door next to me and stepped inside, breathing a sigh of relief. But then I turned myself around and screamed.

“Welcome to my office.” Eggert echoed. “You’ve made it so far. I can tell that you have a good grasp of the fundamentals of commonly-used software tools and environments, particularly open-source tools likely to be used in upper-division computer science courses.”

I whimpered and backed into the corner of his office.

“You may be wondering how you got here. I created a *symbolic link* between mathsci 6229 and my office here in Engineering VI.”

“I want you to know that I won’t hurt you. I was merely testing you.”

I gulped and looked into his eyes. “Really?”

“Yes...” Eggert replied, “In fact, I brought you here into my office to ask you one very important question.”

“What?” I stuttered.

Eggert leaned back in his chair, smiling. “You see, for the past several years I have been building up a team of highly capable individuals, ones that can anticipate foreign cybersecurity threats from places such as USC and stop them. I use the class CS35L in order to sort through all of UCLA’s undergraduate CS students, and find the ones with the potential to join this league of cyber heroes.”

“That’s... That’s impossible...” I said.

“You probably haven’t realized it yet,” Eggert explained, “but while running away from me you were able to utilize a multitude of linux commands in order to escape my wrath. Do you understand what that means?”

“Uh....” I said, realizing it was quite strange I was able to verbally incantate gnu coreutils, “y-yeah, I guess...?”

Eggert gazed so deeply into my soul I felt as if he had run the command *top* on my internal organs. “Join me, and together we will curve down the world.”

We went down about half-a-dozen times and mapped them out, and even took a few other people on ""tours"".

https://imgur.com/a/xVleyd5

The first pic in that album is the map my friend made. In addition to the notes in the map, here are a few other interesting details.

1. We called the pink room east of Royce the ""toilet graveyard"". It looked like a natural ravine that had been roofed over with a street, and was the largest underground open area we discovered. It contained hundreds of discarded toilets and other debris.

2. From the tunnel access in Royce Hall we were able to get into the West tower. If I remember correctly, the stairs into the tower ascended from the third floor. I think we looked for access into the East tower but couldn't find our way up. While up in the West tower I remember thinking that it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and we lingered up there for a while.

3. The steam tunnels were lit and generally navigable. They weren't bright, but we didnt need flashlights; the insides of the buildings were darker. There were some tight spaces, but it nothing too bad. It was warm and humid, as you might expect. There were plenty of dangerous electrical and mechanical equipment, and we were careful not to touch anything. Someone got burned on a steam pipe, but I forget who (not me).

4. Finally, the second picture in the linked album is from a recent visit to UCLA. This is the door on Royce Hall that I believe we used as a main entrance. There were many exits, but this was the only unlocked entrance."

This company helped the family create a falsified soccer profile, ACT score and transcript for their daughter to apply to UCLA as a student-athlete. The soccer coach, Salcedo, recieved a $100,000 cut to facilitate the admission and the daughter’s application to UCLA was approved the following month.

Following the payment, the father Bruce Isackson said in an email, “Per our discussion can you please send me an email confirming that if [our daughter] is not admitted to UCLA as a freshman for the Fall 2016 class that The Key Worldwide Foundation will refund our $250,000.000?”

Is this crazy or what? 250k? That's a lot of cheese. I guess the dad is the president of a real estate firm in the bay area. Their daughter is a third year, I believe.

Recently, I’ve had an opportunity to meet with our chancellor, Gene Block. After meeting with him, I’ve been giving a lot of thought: our interaction, our friendship, his undying love for me. And I’ve reach the conclusion: Gene Block is an irl, cookie-cutter tsundere character; not only is he tsundere, but also maintains a harem of his own. Let me prove this to you.

“420spook420-kun! Glad to see you! Welcome to my office hours!” Block-sensei said, with a smile across his face.

It wasn’t always like this. 

Back in my younger days, when I was but a naive freshman at UCLA, I also had the opportunity to drop by his brief office hours. I went through the application, and through the lottery I was picked. I was rather excited to meet him.

When I went through the doors to greet him, he was rather… distant. He didn’t seem as excited to meet the students as the students wanted to meet him. I was nervous, meeting THE chancellor of UCLA. I sat down in front of him.

“Do you have anything to ask me?” Block-sensei said, with a stoic expression across his face. In that moment, I forgot what I wanted to ask him. It was like the movies, when you get angry at the main character for not saying the right things at the right times. But in that moment, I choked up and forgot what I was going to say.

“I didn’t set aside an hour to not meet my own students, b-baka!” Block-sensei folded his arms and looked to the side. His cheeks started to get a little rosy.

What the fuck?

I was confused at first, but quickly came to the realization that Block-sensei might be…tsundere? Of all people, Block-sensei? 

I didn’t know how to feel about his remarks, how he looked to the side, but it gave me a little bit more courage. It sort of put me at...ease. I mustered up the chikara and finally grasped the words that I wanted to say.

“Why do you care so much about UCLA athletics, when we have so many talented… refined….CAPABLE north campus majors who are able to consistently place top of the class Math 1? And Arts and Architecture 10?”

Block-sensei chuckled. He kicked his feet up onto his desk and looked at me tenderly through the eyes.

“Do you think you can keep a secret?” Block-sensei said. I nodded slowly, not sure if I was amused at this point or angry. How could anyone not have noticed, the Daily Bruin always painted Block-sensei as a quiet, yet stern man with minimal interactions with the students. Was I dreaming?

“You see, 420spook420-kun, I’ve always been a little...afraid of the outside world. When I was in high school, I was playing ball with my friends, but one of my good friends kicked the ball into the street. A truck hit...”

“You were fucking isekai’d by truck-kun.” I said firmly.

“Language, but yes, I was. And I was born into a body of a chancellor, the chancellor of UCLA nonetheless” Block-sensei said to me.

I didn’t know what to think at that moment. Was Block-sensei the ultimate culmination of anime tropes? What the actual shit? I opened my mouth once more to speak. He put his finger in front of my lips, and he began to speak.

“And since then, I guess you can say… I’ve had a harem of blue backpackers. I didn’t ask for them. They kind of flocked me. The entire athletics department, the football team...are all part of my harem. I’m sorry I was a little cold to you, 420spook420-kun. I’m just getting more used to these...formalities.”

Before I could say anything, there was a knock on the door. The next student was coming in. As I got out of my chair Block-sensei called my name.

He turned to me, and gave me a thumbs up. I could’ve sworn he winked at me.

420spook420 signing out."

I'm excited for life to come after college but there's something a little sad about it. I feel like I've only just begun to make really good friends, enjoy my classes fully, and begin truly loving life at UCLA. There's something so transient about college too, knowing a ton of my friends are from different states or different countries and will be going far away after we graduate, or moving onto other big things.

Defendants DAD and MOM, a married couple (together, “the FAMILY”), live in CITY, STATE. DAD is president of a real estate development firm in CITY, STATE. As set forth below, the FAMILYS took part in both the college recruitment scheme and the college entrance exam cheating scheme. RINGLEADER has advised law enforcement agents that in or about 2015 and 2016, the FAMILYS agreed with him to use bribery to secure their older daughter’s admission to college as a recruited athlete. Initially, according to RINGLEADER, he sought to secure the FAMILYS’ daughter’s admission to USC—**her first-choice school^1**—as a purported soccer recruit. In or about mid-September 2015, **RINGLEADER e-mailed her high school transcripts, ACT score and a falsified soccer profile to Janke**, who forwarded the materials to the USC women’s soccer coach. 

On or about February 17, 2016, **an assistant athletic director at USC e-mailed the women’s soccer coach that the application had been diverted to the regular admissions process due to a “clerical error.” On or about May 20, 2016, Ali Khosroshahin, the former head coach of women’s soccer at USC, forwarded the falsified soccer profile, ACT score and transcripts on RINGLEADER’s behalf to Jorge Salcedo, the head coach of UCLA men’s soccer** Khosroshahin wrote: “soccer player/student manager. I have attached her profile, player explanation, transcripts for both high schools and ACT scores…will make sure she has registered with the NCAA. Please let me know if you need any additional information[.]” On or about June 28, 2016, the UCLA student-athlete admissions committee approved the FAMILYS’ daughter for provisional admission that fall. RINGLEADER notified the FAMILYS via e-mail the following day. **MOM responded, copying DAD and their daughter: “I know it has been a rough ride but I thank you from the bottom of my heart and soul for your persistence, creativity and commitment towards helping [our daughter].”^2 **

On or about July 7, 2016, RINGLEADER directed a payment of $100,000 from one of the FAKE CHARITY charitable accounts to a sports marketing company controlled by Salcedo. RINGLEADER subsequently also caused FAKE CHARITY to issue a check to Khosroshahin in the amount of $25,000. On or about July 8, 2016, Masera sent MOM an invoice from FAKE CHARITY in the amount of $250,000. The invoice stated: “Private Contribution – Letter of receipt will be provided upon payment.” 

On or about July 11, 2016, DAD e-mailed RINGLEADER, copying MOM: “Thanks for the follow up call regarding the attached Key Worldwide Foundation invoice. Per our discussion can you please send me an email confirming that if [our daughter] is not admitted to UCLA as a freshman for the Fall 2016 class that The Key Worldwide Foundation will refund our $250,000.00 gift. Again, both MOM and I are greatly appreciative of all your efforts on [our daughter]’s behalf!” That same day, RINGLEADER e-mailed the FAMILYS: “[T]his is to confirm that your donation of $250,000 to The Key Worldwide Foundation supporting educational initiatives we have created to help those who need it the most will be returned if [your daughter’s] admission to UCLA is reversed from the email acceptance she has already received.” On or about July 15, 2016, **FAMILY transferred 2,150 shares of Facebook, Inc. stock, having a value of approximately $251,249, to FAKE CHARITY**. Approximately one week later, Masera sent the FAMILYS a letter acknowledging the purported charitable contribution, and stating: “Your generosity will allow us to move forward with our plans to provide educational and self-enrichment programs to disadvantaged youth.” The letter falsely indicated that “no goods or services were exchanged” for the money. 

RINGLEADER has advised law enforcement agents that the FAMILYS thereafter agreed with him to engage in the **college entrance exam cheating scheme for their younger daughter.^3** On or about January 23, 2017, MOM e-mailed RINGLEADER documentation of ACT, Inc.’s approval for her younger daughter to take the ACT over successive days. On or about May 8, 2017, MOM e-mailed RINGLEADER: “She is working towards June 10, 11 testing in LA . .Please send me details of testing location and anything I need to do beforehand.” On or about June 9, 2017, RINGLEADER’S ASSISTANT traveled from Tampa to Los Angeles. The FAMILYS’ daughter took the ACT at the West Hollywood Test Center on or about the following day. RINGLEADER’S ASSISTANT returned to Tampa on or about June 11, 2017. The FAMILYS’ daughter received a score of **31 out of a possible 36^4** on the exam. 

On or about June 12, 2017, RINGLEADER paid RINGLEADER’S ASSISTANT $15,600 via a check issued from one of the FAKE CHARITY charitable accounts. On or about June 21, 2017, **DAD caused shares of stock having a value of approximately $101,272 to be transferred to FAKE CHARITY**. Thereafter, according to RINGLEADER, the **FAMILYS agreed with him to secure their younger daughter’s admission to USC as a purported rowing recruit**, even though she was not competitive in rowing, but instead was an avid equestrian. In or about October 2017, **RINGLEADER sent the FAMILYS’ daughter’s high school transcript and fraudulently obtained ACT score to Heinel, writing, “Another Crew Girl,” and directed Janke to create a crew profile for her. The profile, which RINGLEADER then forwarded to Heinel, falsely stated that the FAMILYS’ daughter was a “Varsity 8 Stroke” for the Redwood Scullers and listed a number of falsified crew honors.** Heinel presented the FAMILYS’ younger daughter to the USC subcommittee for athletic admissions as a purported crew recruit on or about November 30, 2017. On or about December 15, 2017, Heinel e-mailed RINGLEADER a letter notifying the FAMILYS’ daughter that she had been conditionally admitted to USC as a student athlete. The letter stated: “Your records indicate that you have the potential to make a significant contribution to the intercollegiate athletic program as well as to the academic life of the university.” **RINGLEADER forwarded the letter to the FAMILYS and their daughter, writing, “Please keep this hush hush till late March.” MOM responded, “Very exciting news…we will definitely lay low until March . . . Would you like to chat next week to discuss any steps I need to take on my end for USC? Thank you again for your help!”** RINGLEADER replied, “Only steps have been discussed with DAD.”

On or about April 9, 2018, shortly after USC mailed a formal acceptance letter to the FAMILYS’s daughter, a **FAKE CHARITY employee e-mailed MOM a $250,000 invoice for the FAMILYS’ “generous donation to The FAKE CHARITY.”** MOM responded, copying DAD, “We are out of the country and will send payment early during the week of April 16th.” On or about April 20, 2018, **DAD caused shares of stock having a value of $249,420 to be transferred to FAKE CHARITY**. RINGLEADER has advised investigators that he earmarked $50,000 of the FAMILYS’ payment for Heinel, who in July 2018 began receiving monthly payments of $20,000 from FAKE CHARITY. 

In a call on or about August 23, 2018, RINGLEADER and MOM spoke on the telephone about **engaging in the college entrance exam cheating scheme on behalf of the FAMILYS’ third child**. The call was intercepted pursuant to a Court-authorized wiretap. In the call, RINGLEADER asked MOM whether they were going to try to “control the test room or is he taking it on his own.” **MOM responded that they wanted to control the testing environment.** 

On or about September 26, 2018, **DAD called RINGLEADER and requested a receipt, for tax purposes, for his purported $100,000 contribution to FAKE CHARITY^5** for his younger daughter’s testing scheme. The following is an excerpt from the call. 

DAD Hey, I was checking for one thing, just for my taxes. I need to get the letter, like you did last time—

RINGLEADER Okay. 

DAD --for the-- for the Facebook stock that I did—

RINGLEADER Okay. 

DAD --do you-- that I think was like 100,000, something like that, las-- is-- can you-- do you track that down to your guys, get the exact amount—

RINGLEADER Yeah. 

DAD --internally—

RINGLEADER Yeah. Lemme—

DAD --if you wouldn’tm--? 

RINGLEADER --lemme-- lemme find out. Was this for-- was this for [your second daughter]? 

DAD This was, when we did the testing. Yeah. Yeah. 

RINGLEADER Uh—

DAD I can give you exact date of it, that the stock-- I can actually send that to you, if that helps you. 
RINGLEADER Okay. Why don’t you do that? 

DAD Yeah. 

RINGLEADER That would be grea—

DAD Yeah. And, actually got it for-- a copy of it from the broker. But I’ll do that to you. That’d be awesome, just that one-page letter—

RINGLEADER Uh—

DAD --saying it’s a 501--(3)—

RINGLEADER Okay. 

On or about October 24, 2018, RINGLEADER called DAD at the direction of law enforcement agents and told him that FAKE CHARITY was being audited by the IRS. The following is an excerpt from the conversation, which was consensually recorded. 

RINGLEADER So, so I’m calling because I’m in Boston—

DAD Uh-huh. 

RINGLEADER --and I-- so what’s happened is my foundation is, is getting audited now. 

DAD Uh-huh. 

RINGLEADER Which, as you know, is pretty typical.

DAD Uh-huh. 

RINGLEADER Right? So they’re looking at all my payments. 

DAD Okay. 

RINGLEADER So they asked about your payments. One of them for when [RINGLEADER’S ASSISTANT] took the test for [your second daughter]. 

DAD Okay. 

RINGLEADER The payment that we made to Jorge, to help [your first daughter] get into UCLA through soccer. 

DAD Okay. 

RINGLEADER And then the payment that we made to Donna Heinel at USC to help [your second daughter] get in through crew. 

DAD Okay. 

RINGLEADER So, of course I’m not going to tell the IRS this is where the money went—

DAD Right, right, right. 

RINGLEADER --and [inaudible]. So I just, I just want to make sure that-- what I’ve told them so far is that that 600K-plus has actually gone to pay for-- paid tour foundation for underserved kids. 

DAD Uh-huh.  

RINGLEADER So I guess, first-- one of the questions I have is, did you take a write-off for those? 

DAD I did take a write-off for those, yes. 

RINGLEADER Okay. All right, I just, I just want to make sure I’m—

DAD Yeah. 

RINGLEADER --on the same page as you. 

DAD Yeah, I did, I did. 

RINGLEADER Okay. Okay. 

DAD I did. I mean-- go ahead, I’m sorry. 

RINGLEADER No, you go. 

DAD Yeah, well, I got-- remember, I was asking for the letter [inaudible] asked for, you know, to the extent that we don’t have it. You know, if we do get audited or something, we would need a letter or something like that. 

RINGLEADER Gotcha. Totally. 

DAD That’s after the fact. Okay. 

RINGLEADER Okay, no problem. So I just wanted to make sure our stories are aligned. 

DAD Yeah. 

On or about December 3, 2018, RINGLEADER called MOM at the direction of law enforcement agents and told her that FAKE CHARITY was being audited by the IRS. The following is an excerpt from the conversation, which was consensually recorded. 

RINGLEADER So they asked about the payments that DAD had made. And I-- I think I told him. But I’m going to tell you. Essentially, that I didn’t say anything about [your second daughter] taking the, the test down at [the West Hollywood Test Center] and having [RINGLEADER’S ASSISTANT] and-- [RINGLEADER’S ASSISTANT] take it and Igor being the site coordinator. I didn’t say anything about that. I just said that it was a donation to our foundation for underserved kids. Are you okay with that? 

MOM Okay. Yeah. Yeah. 

Although the quality of the phone call was clear, MOM then told RINGLEADER, “It’s really hard to hear you but why don’t we talk later tonight[.]” RINGLEADER went to the FAMILYS’ home later that evening to meet with DAD. The meeting was consensually recorded. During the meeting, RINGLEADER asked if MOM—who was traveling—wanted to participate by phone. DAD responded: “You know, I am so paranoid about this fucking thing you were talking about. I don’t like talking about it on the phone, you know.” Later in the meeting, DAD noted: “I’m so paranoid about MOM, I go, ‘I really don’t want you talking on the phone to [RINGLEADER] about this.’ You know, I’m thinkin’, you know, are they—I mean, I can’t imagine they’d go to the trouble of tapping my phone—but would they tap someone like your phones?” DAD and RINGLEADER then discussed what would happen if the FAMILYS received a call from the IRS. The following is an excerpt from the conversation. 

DAD [W]orst case, we were to get a call from them, and they would say to you, you know, I guess, “Prove you gave this money,” they’d ask for some—

RINGLEADER Which you did. 

DAD --yeah-- ask for some kind of thing, and I don’t-- I only got, I think, a, a, a receipt from you, or, I don’t know, like, one-- like, the last two of ’em I don’t think I did. 

RINGLEADER Okay. 

DAD If we-- if we-- you know, if you want to—

RINGLEADER Well, we can get that to you. 

DAD --i-if we can do that – 

RINGLEADER Yeah, absolutely. 

DAD --that would be great, yeah. But, you know, just the letter saying “Thank you for your gift” or whatnot, of whatever—

RINGLEADER Right. 

DAD --you know, you’re helping out with. But so, so let’s say they, they, they, they, they do that. For example, when we did the testing thing—

RINGLEADER Mm-hmm. 

DAD --that was as a gift, right? Yeah. 

RINGLEADER Right. 

DAD And they’re not-- there’s no way they can correlate and say that that wasn’t for a gift? That would only be if they would talk to you about that and say “Where did that go?” Right? You know what I’m saying? 

RINGLEADER Right. Right—

DAD Yeah. 

RINGLEADER --so they wouldn’t-- at least, I wouldn’t know—

DAD Right. 

RINGLEADER --how they would know? 

DAD Yeah. 

RINGLEADER It would just be looked at as a gift. 

DAD Mm-hmm. 

RINGLEADER Um—

DAD But what happens when they track,[RINGLEADER], worst case, that 75,000, and they say, “Show me where that went”? 

RINGLEADER Well-- So that-- so I guess what I-- I guess-- that’s a good question. 

DAD Yeah. 

RINGLEADER So that 75 comes in.

 DAD Uh-huh. RINGLEADER It’s a part of a lot of other money, right? 

DAD But part—

RINGLEADER So—

DAD --part of-- When you say—

RINGLEADER Well, because a lotta other money’s in, in the pot. 

DAD Coming in the pot, right. 

RINGLEADER Right? And then I’m turning around and paying [RINGLEADER’S ASSISTANT] and Igor. And so I guess they could s-- they could see that—

DAD Right. 

RINGLEADER --and maybe they’ll cor-- Yeah, that’s a good q-- that’s good—

DAD Yeah, yeah. 

RINGLEADER --because they may correlate—

DAD Right. 

RINGLEADER --that the testing was a part of it. 

DAD Ri-- I, I don’t know, yeah. 

At a number of points in the meeting, DAD and RINGLEADER discussed the potential repercussions if the IRS were to uncover the true purpose of the payments to FAKE CHARITY: 

RINGLEADER And I’m just saying, “Hey, I was just told to call everybody.” 

DAD Yeah, no, I appreciate that, and I’m glad you did. It’s just something that when it happened, my stomach, like, kind of fell out. 

RINGLEADER Oh, well, sure. 

DAD Yeah. 

RINGLEADER I think it should. 

DAD Oh, yeah. I’m just thinking, oh my God, because you’re thinking, does this roll into something where, you know, if they get into the meat and potatoes, is this gonna be this-- be the front page story with everyone from Kleiner Perkins do whatever, getting these kids into school, and—

RINGLEADER Well, the, the person who’d be on the front page—

DAD Well, I, I-- But if-- but they, they – 

RINGLEADER Yes. 

DAD --went the meat and potatoes of it, which a-- which a guy would love to have is, it’s so hard for these kids to get into college, and here’s-- look what-- look what’s going on behind the schemes, and then, you know, the, the embarrassment to everyone in the communities. Oh my God, it would just be-- Yeah. Ugh. 

Later, in the conversation, **DAD told RINGLEADER that if they proceeded with the college entrance exam cheating scheme for their third child, “I think we’ll definitely pay cash this time, and not, not-- not run it through the other way.”**

1: The fact her first choice was USC should have been a red flag that she wasn't cut out for UCLA

2: The daughter definitely knew about this.

3: Younger daughter cheated on the ACT 

4: And she only got a 31 LMAO

5: Dad drops $100,000 for his daughter to cheat and wants to write it off for a tax deduction. Morally bankrupt as they come

TL;DR

Family pays $250,000 in Facebook stocks for the first daughter to go to USC as a soccer recruit. There was a filing error and her app was sent to the regular decision pool and not the athlete pool where she was sure to be rejected. The USC coach sent her app to Jorge Salcedo at UCLA where he accepted her and was paid $100,000. Family paid $100,000 for second daughter to take the ACT in a controlled environment where she got a 31/36. Then an additional $250,000 in stocks was paid for her to be accepted to USC as a rowing recruit. There were talks of arranging for their son to take the ACT in a controlled environment for an undisclosed cash amount."

Today I had (stupidly) left my backpack outside Haines A39 to turn in a quiz from about 7:42-7:52am, and I came back to my backpack ransacked (all zippers open, belongings rifled through  and everything) and thrown into a nearby bush.  My laptop and wallet had been stolen... laptop, hw, cards, drivers license, and a decent amount of cash

I’ve already reported to UCPD and gave them the serial number, tried to locate it using my Microsoft account (but it’s offline), cancelled my cards, etc. I know this is a long shot, but if anyone encounters a black surface pro 6 (maybe with a champagne gold vinyl skin) and a blue/teal 15” laptop sleeve OR a long green wallet with silver/jewel buckle it would mean the world to me. I really truly can’t afford to replace the items atm :/ 

Also if you guys have any suggestions/advice as to what I can do next that’d be greatly appreciated

And please learn from my mistakes and be careful with your own belongings! Even if you’re gonna go to the bathroom for like 3 min, just be careful.

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen virtual private machines in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the virtual private machines and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any unknowledgeable undergraduate infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each virtual private machine and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."

Want to know what makes UCLA stand out for me?

The Big Dicks.

Allow me to explain a bit. So I transferred in after one year from a community college in Orange County and, without a doubt, the average dick size at UCLA is bigger. Call me crazy but that's been my experience here. Keep in mind that this conclusion isn't a result of any scientific statistical analysis or anything. (I'm a novice at stats). There could be a number of factors influencing why this has been the case for me. But whatever the reason, all I know is that, on average, the guys at UCLA have had way bigger dicks than the guys at my community college. Since I am pretty promiscuous I think my sample size is pretty good. In the three years I've been here, N &gt; 30. At my CC, the sample wasn't quite as large but still pretty big. I also have quite a few friends at Berkeley and they've reported that the dicks there are on the smaller-to-average side when we discuss sizes. The same is true at UCSD, though still bigger than Cal. My friends tell me they're shocked when I tell them about my experience. Our measuring procedures aren't exactly scientific, I know, but hear me out.

At least, for me, there has only been two guys from my community college who had dicks as big as the guys at UCLA. I guess I haven't measured them with a ruler or anything, but I have a pretty good eye for size and definitely pay extra attention to every guy's size. I've been mentally keeping track of dick sizes since I was in high school. It's just this sort of weird, funny ranking system I have in my head. I didn't think much of it till last year when I realized that the dicks at UCLA have been way bigger than dicks from my past.

Anyway back to the analysis. So it seems like every guy I've slept with here, and I've slept with quite a few\*, seems to be at least .7-1.2 inches bigger than the non-UCLA dicks I've experienced. If you know anything about mean penis sizes this is quite significant, at least to me. UCLA dicks tend to be girthier as well. So not only are they longer they are thicker as well, which has made for some great experiences in bed, though I must say that big dicks DON'T always predict great sex. But it does help when you know how to use that thing, just saying.

I'm still trying to wrap my head around this. Could it be that the guys that I'm attracted to are attractive to me because they are so confident--confidence that stems from the fact that they have a big dick? If this is the case then maybe I'm unconsciously pre-selecting guys (confident guys) who are more likely to have big dicks, thus biasing my sample as a  convenience sample. The thing is, though, that at my CC I was also attracted to confident guys and the dicks simply weren't as big as they are here.

Or maybe it's the fact that UCLA just attracts students with bigger dicks in general? Students who are in shape, confident (and really smart of course). I think the LA lifestyle really pressures people to either conform to this lifestyle or attract people who already align with it. And that guys who end up here are the type of guys who have big dicks, guys who are happier and more secure and most likely to be all about their appearance and style, perhaps? Idk. Lots of conjecture here. But I just want to try to make sense of this with a working theory. I think big dick guys just want to live in LA, are attracted to the lifestyle and decide to matriculate here. Whatever the reason, dicks here have been bigger in my experience than at my community college and beyond. And, according to reports from a big sample of my friends at other schools, UCLA dicks bigger than dicks at Berkeley and UCSD too.

What I would like to see is a more scientific study and analysis of average dick sizes between UC schools. I had to take a guess, I'd say UCLA dicks would probably be bigger than Berkeley or UCSD dicks. Not sure about Irvine, Riverside or schools like that. But at least for the top UC schools, UCLA tends to have bigger dicks. They should fund a study to find out and measure students at each school. 

So, yeah, really random and probably pretty weird to you all. But that's what I wanted to share.

This is where the problem comes in because if I try to close the windows, Chad threatens to pull down his pants. I thought he was joking but one night, I saw his bare ass in the corner of my eyes as he shouted “OP, IT’S OUT” while I was closing the window. This happened about a week ago and now, he whips out his dick whenever Bob and I do something that does not please Chad. After Chad showers, he tells me and Bob to close our eyes, walking back and forth around the room fully naked while drying his body and putting on his underwear. Sometimes, he just sits in his chair with his pants down while telling us to look at him. Chad says he uses his exposure as a weapon to fulfill his needs. Bob tried to film Chad in an attempt to blackmail him as Chad  exposed his willy but Chad leaped to Bob’s second level bunk bed (with his pants still down) like a hero in the Planet of the Apes and forced Bob to delete the evidence.

He hit his head on the ground and was so hurt that he had to shake his head a number of times before realizing he was bleeding from his forehead and nose. The blood just mixed in with the coffee he dropped and just went everywhere. I was just so shocked that I didn’t know what to do, and neither did the people around me. They asked the man if he would like to go to the Ashe center and offered him help but he turned down all the help offered to him. He started to walk away still bleeding, and I just decided to go to class. 

I just felt completely useless and hurt in this situation. I didn’t even help him up. I didn’t know what to do. I’m not originally from here so I am completely oblivious as to what would have been right to do in this situation; I had never dealt with this kind of dilemma in the past. I feel as though the main reason as to why he turned down all the help offered was because he was elderly and we, young adults, encircled him and made him feel embarrassed trying to help him. I just felt incredibly useless and stupid. 

What would be the right thing to do in this sort of situation?"

The chem 110A professor just now released the grades. A week after the new quarter starts. 

I got a D+.

Meaning I can’t take chem 156 meaning I can’t graduate this quarter.

I didn’t even do bad on the final. Just did so poorly on the midterm that recovery was almost impossible. Explained my situation to the professor, but that asshole didn’t care.

Now I’m going to be dropped for chem 156 that I’m already enrolled in. Can’t do concurrent because one is a prerequisite of the other. 

And I have to inform my PhD programs tomorrow.

I’d be glad to continue on in the summer but my PhD programs that I got accepted for would have to reject me.


TLDR; failed pchem, I have to reject my grad school offers. Can’t graduate. Hate myself. "

With most of the excitement about admissions, at least for Freshmen, out of the way, the moderation team has decided to roll out some new initiatives to slowly improve the new admit experience on this sub. With that in mind, we've decided to put some work into get a wiki dedicated to helping out new users.

First off, we're looking for a new admit to help us document the admission/SIR process. We would just want a couple of screenshots going through the whole process of checking your email, logging in to see your admission status, submitting your SIR and any other intermediary steps. Of course, please white out any personal information as this would be posted on our wiki as a graphical guide for future prospective Bruins.

We're also interested in documenting the housing application/roommate search process. It would be helpful if someone else (or the same person) could document and walk through the process of accessing your housing application, selecting preferences and roommates, submitting the application and any other intermediary steps. 

If you're interested in helping document this process for future bruins, leave a comment below and I'll DM you.

If there are any other official UCLA related applications/processes that apply to a specific school (L&amp;S, HSSEAS, Nursing, etc) or to the student body in general, please leave a comment and we'll consider adding a section in the wiki.

For all other new admits, leave a list of topics that you think will be helpful for future new admits. Note that this process will be ongoing throughout the year so many of your current questions like ""How do I enroll in classes?"" will be covered in due time. The purposes of this thread is to get an idea that you may have about UCLA as soon as you were admitted. Appropriate questions would be ""How do I contact the Financial Aid Office?"" or ""What/When is Orientation?""

If you aren't listened to go to the dean with your concerns. You should always strive to maintain the integrity of health of your peers, institution, and more importantly, yourself. If you see something, say something. Allowing measles to operate unhampered hurts you. It raises the overall measles count and ultimately hurts those who don't have measles. Your health suffers in light of those with unfair measles. In classes where you are graded relative to them you can't stand out when they get to do all their work from home; it deflates your honest effort. It can affect your prospects in grad school admissions or jobs. You stand out less when you have measles.

It lowers the value of the degree. If cheaters can graduate with measles when they really don't know shit, what will it say about the institution? One, it might show that the standards here are low if even people with measles can do well. Employers will wonder, 'how did this clown graduate with measles from UCLA?' Second, it'll suggest that this school lets measles slip through the cracks. We must not allow this. It must be purged.

There was a story last year of a group sharing measles during an exam and how infuriating it was for student's who studied honestly to have to witness that. This was not the only occurrence. I heard about a couple of these incidents. Measles manifests in different ways. So root it out and report it immediately whenever you see it. Never sit idle. Get it into every potential person with measles' head that there will be great costs if caught.

We must be proactive in reporting measles. It should not be tolerated. Report them all. And if nothing is done keep moving up the ladder with your complaints until it's addressed accordingly."

Why? 
Every year, DB chooses a new editor-in-chief. Ah, my mistake. It’s actually the ASUCLA Communications Board that appoints the editor-in-chief, but every year, DB staffers hold a giant and long hearing for hours interviewing each candidate and at the end voting for the candidate that we like the most. The candidate that wins gets submitted to the Communications Board as DB’s recommendation, and for the past couple decades, the Communications Board has followed DB’s choice and appointed the recommended candidate. That did not happen this year, and the Communications Board appointed someone else citing that the recommended candidate only got 58% of the vote whereas past recommended candidates got 90% or above of the vote. 
It’s a sad situation all around, because no matter what the next editor-in-chief will have to deal with this situation and clean up the mess, and this will cast a long shadow over next year.
As someone who works in DB, it’s a tough choice for many to either participate in the strike or continue working. Practically most of the sections are neutered bc their editors are on strike. 
My personal feelings on the matter, and I don’t speak for DB or anyone else at DB, but I wholeheartedly support the recommended candidate. The process is no joke, and the annual DB hearing is a grueling process. And after that, the Communications Board holds its own set of interviews. We don’t get casual candidates for editor in chief.

It's almost that time of year again, when you can't walk down bruinwalk without getting harassed by 50 different candidates. 

For those of you that were around last year, the sub was a bit of a disaster, and I will take full credit for that. It was probably my biggest mistake in the 5 or 6 years I've been a mod. Luckily, since then /u/ESPNtheocho4 and /u/confirmedpenguin have joined the team and they're a lot smarter than I am. So, in our talks we've tried to come up with a few options for how to moderate the upcoming elections and want to see you guys think about them. First, a rundown of what happened last year (feel free to skip ahead if you were here):

* One candidate was running on a ""Dissolve USAC"" platform. Which resonated on /r/ucla

* The subreddit became inundated with posts that either said ""Fuck USAC"" or memes about how terrible USAC is. 

* A user claiming to be a part of USAC made a post basically saying ""No, fuck all of you guys."" And made the point of how the toxicity has spiraled out of control on the subreddit.

* I realized the toxicity had gotten out of hand. If it was any other student organization, I would have removed the posts, so why should USAC be any different? I pulled down posts that said nothing but ""Fuck USAC"" and tried to consolidate them into one megathread. 

* This led to a lot of backlash as people felt silenced. People were upset, and I don't blame them. I should have communicated better and stepped in to stem the toxicity much earlier. 

That brings us to this year, the first USAC posts are starting to pop up and we want to handle them better. A couple lessons learned: **criticism of an organization is totally fine, but just saying ""Fuck USAC"" and nothing else is not.** We've had an interesting case already this year of a throwaway account slandering a potential candidate by name. That's not okay either.

So **what we actually want your feedback on is what we've come up with so far**:

1. Actual news stories (generally Daily Bruin articles) relevant to the election are totally fine.

1. We will have megathreads for general discussion. We will cycle through these depending on how active they are. If there's a ton of activity, we can make new ones every couple days. If it's slower, we'll probably make one each week. The rules will be a little more relaxed in these threads although outright toxicity still has no place.

1. Posts attacking candidates or the organization as a whole will be removed. Again, criticism is fine as long as its civil. Generally most discussion should be directed to the megathread.

1. If there is interest, we can reach out to USAC and see if they're interested in AMAs (probably in groups due to the large number of candidates). Or if people would rather, we can try to be Switzerland and stay as far out of politics as possible.

1. We lean towards not allowing political ads for any candidate, but again, these rules are up for discussion.

That is mostly where we're at right now. What do you guys think? And as a disclaimer: I am a graduate student. I have no stake in this election. We as moderaters just want this sub to be as useful to everyone as it can possibly be while being kind to Bruins at all levels. Thank you!"

So I made a post a while back (https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/b4m1l6/i_love_ucla/) about how excited I was as an upcoming freshman to attend UCLA next fall. I was met with a lot of cynicalism, so I'd like to update you guys on how I feel about UCLA now that I've just come back from the Pride Admit Program and Women in Enginnering Sleepover Program, and have gotten to learn a lot about UCLA.

What really excited me about UCLA originally was how supportive I thought they'd be of who I am, and let me tell you, at the PAW sleepover I got that affirmed hard. Everyone at UCLA's LGBTQ+ community is so inclusive and nice and chill!! On campus, they have so much amazing support for LGBTQ+ people - they literally have everything from drag shows (!!!!) to an LGBTQ+ library to amazing trans healthcare. I had such a blast at the sleepover - all of us PAW admits had a dance party and I got the number of several really cute girls! I definitely want to join UCLA's LGBTQ+ tutoring program later on, and I'm going to binge read Outwrite magazines like nobody's business.

The most fun part about WESP was that I got to have dinner with Professor Pottie! I didn't even know that he was the EE department chair until like halfway through dinner. We originally talked about some of his classes, but then somehow we got sidetracked to discussing dungeons and dragons. Prof. Pottie was so adorable with his bowtie and he seems really dedicated to education as well as research, which I love. Not going to lie, Prof. Pottie is like my favorite UCLA staff member as of now. 

Both my hosts for PAW and WESP were really sweet and accomodating about letting me drape my sleeping bag all over their floor. I got to stay in both a plaza triple and a classic triple for a night, and I actually prefer the classic triple. Surprisingly, the communal restrooms are quite nice! And you don't have to clean them, which is priceless.

The academics at UCLA excite me more than ever as well! I got introduced to so many amazing engineering clubs like IEEE, WATTS, and the Rocket Project. I was also invited to the EE honors program Fast Track, which is loaded with amazing opportunities like internships and undergrad research. The only caveat is that I need to maintain like a 3.3 GPA to stay in the program, so that's kind of a yikes.

Tbh, I'm not really worried about class registration anymore due to how strict the engineering curriculumn is - I know that the advisors will help me get the classes I need to graduate, and if that means that I don't get to take classes at ideal times, then hey, it is what it is. Right now I'm mostly worried that I'll struggle a lot academically because of how hard the engineering majors are (and I have to take honors classes as well, so more yikes). I'm also a little disappointed by how unfeasible it is for EE students to minor in something - I'll definitely have to speak to an advisor about my academic plans. But even despite all of these worries, I know that I'll have a great four years where I can feel at ease with myself. I'm so happy that I got admitted, and I'm thankful for every rejection I got from ""better"" schools, because baby, I'M GOING TO UCLA!

P.S. The food is SO GOOD. I got to have Diddy Riese like twice!!

TL;DR: After visiting UCLA, I've fallen even more in love with their LGBTQ+ community and their amazing EE curriculumn! I'm so excited for September!!"

Can you two please keep it down? Like it was funny the first couple of times I noticed but now it's gotten out of hand. You guys have sex almost every single fucking night and it's LOUD. Literally, I'll walk down the hall to either the bathroom or the trash chute and I can hear you moaning the stupidest shit! Seriously, how many times can you really yell, ""Ohh yeah, fuck that asshole, ooh yeahh, fuck it hard."" It's even audible from the room. And the guy is even worse because in addition to him being all like ""Ahhh yeah, ahh yeah baby,"" he's all like ""You like that shit baby? Huh? Yeah? Ah fuck. Ahhh yeah. That ass feels sooo good."" I swear I didn't expect the freaking acoustics to be so fluid in here.

You guys must think you're sooo cool having all that sex. Well guess what? You're not. You'd think that people who got into UCLA would have the decency to be considerate to others in this close-quarter living shit show we are in. But nope. You can't expect peace and quiet; not on this floor. It's absurd.

It's just that they have sex so often it's starting to feel like they are rubbing it in our faces. It gets me so mad sometimes. Like I feel that they are being loud on purpose to try and show off how much sex they have. Some of us aren't getting any sex and it's frustrating that we have to put up with it. I haven't gotten laid since I was fucking born; and meanwhile this freaking guy keeps yelling ""Omg yeah, omg, it feels so fucking good, ohh, ohhhh. Fuck that little assssholeeee"" so loud that the entire floor can hear it when they step out into the hallway. My floor isn't very social and people walk around with headphones but I know a lot of them hear it too. They just pretend not to at this point because it's way passed the funny phase and now in the annoying/awkward phase where we just passively put up with it.

I just want to walk to the bathroom without hearing them have sex for once. I mean, I'm not hating on them, but couldn't they just keep it down a bit? Jeeze. Sometimes it lasts for like 45 minutes. Two weeks ago in went on for over a day. They just keep having sex super loud and I'm tempted to just pound on their door one of these days mid-fuck and ask to join in. I just wish they didn't have to yell like that. He's obviously fucking him good or whatever, so good for him, but seriously, stfu!

The other guy also thinks he's soooo cool the way he walks around in the morning. I see him when he's leaving the showers and he's got this stupid smirk on his face, chuckling in the bathroom while he checks himself out in the mirror. Idk, it lends credence to my theory that he's doing it to show off. I try not to let it bother me, but when I'm in my room beating my meat for like the umpteenth time because it's the best I can do, then yeah, it's a little frustrating having other people's sex life rubbed in my face like that. I've never considered myself a bitter or jealous person, but after having to hear ""Ooooh yeahhh, fuck it harder.."" every night for weeks it makes me feel like shit.

I cannot be the only one who's had an experience like this. What should I do about it? It's one of those situations where you look like a total triangle if you complain to the RA. And what RA really wants to knock on a door and disrupt someone from getting some action. It's awkward. Plus I would probably look jealous or bitter if I complained. Oh wait, shit.

Also I only really know about classics sorry :)

&amp;#x200B;

CLASSICS

Room/bathroom info: Rooms aren't as cramped as you expect; all three of us can be in at once and I won't feel crowded. Bathrooms are cleaned twice a day so they stay relatively clean (girl's bathroom has a lot of hair tho lol). I haven't had to wait in line for a shower yet, but it might happen. You do not have AC but I haven't had any issues with it so far. I'm also not in my room that often so I don't really feel it. Definitely get a fan though, sometimes you just need to air out the room. 

&amp;#x200B;

HEDRICK HALL

Pros: Almost all freshman! Very social, you have The Study downstairs (little take out place that accepts swipes, I go there at least once a day). You will meet a lot of people and there's always some kind of activity

Cons: The farthest classic residential hall, it can get a little loud and overwhelming especially for people who like their space. I still recommend it.

RIEBER HALL

Pros: It's closer! And central. Everything is about the same distance from Rieber Hall which is nice. It is also majority freshmen, but not as social (not socially dead, just not to the extent as Hedrick). You also have Rendevous (another swipe take out place) and Fiest (dining hall)

Cons: Honestly there aren't a lot of cons, maybe that it's not as freshmen-heavy so they may not have as many activities. Rieber is always a pretty good option. 

&amp;#x200B;

SPROUL HALL

Pros: It's even closer to campus! It's also VERY central so you can go anywhere from Sproul. You have Cafe 1919, Bruin Cafe, the campus store, the mailing center, and Covel (dining hall). A lot of LLCs are also in Sproul Hall. The bathrooms are also supposedly a little nicer (idk about this). 

Cons: It is mainly second-years, so you might not meet that many freshmen. The few freshmen I know who live there don't have any problem with meeting other freshmen (you meet a lot of people in classes). 

&amp;#x200B;

DYKSTRA

Pros: VERY CLOSE TO CAMPUS like it's as close as you can possibly get from the Hill. You have De Neve downstairs (dining hall). The rooms are also really nice! I've been up there a few times and rooms have a lot of storage space. 

Cons: It's definitely the quietest out of the classics, but not too bad. Also, people complain about the bathrooms but I thought they were fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

PLAZAS

Rooms/bathrooms: These rooms are more spacious and have AC. There's also the shared/private bathroom (you either share one bathroom between you and roommates, or with your room and the room next door. They get cleaned twice (?) a week but they don't get too rank. 

Okay so I don't know a lot about plazas, but the order of distance from campus (farthest to closest)

HEDRICK SUMMIT &gt; RIEBER TERRACE/VISTA &gt; SUNSET VILLAGE &gt; DE NEVE 

They're a little quieter, but most people seem to still meet the people on their floor so don't worry too much.

&amp;#x200B;

SUITES

Yeah, I don't know anything about these sorry. There's Hitch (far) and Saxon (not as far?) but that's all I know. People say they're socially dead but that's not completely true. And ultimately, even if you do live in a classic, it's up to you to reach out and meet people. 

&amp;#x200B;

BONUS MEAL PLAN INFO (ranked in order of decreasing cost) 

**19P** Most swipes, most flexibility. You have 209 swipes (19 per week for 10 weeks plus finals) to use however you want throughout the quarter, and they roll over to the next quarter if you don't use them. 

**14P** Fewer swipes, most flexibility. You have 154 swipes to use just like 19P. This averages about 2 meals per day. Good for people who don't like to eat breakfast. Also roll over. 

**19R** (What I have!!) I LOVE 19R. Most swipes, less flexibility. You still have 209 swipes, but you can use up to 5 per day for a total of 19 per week. You can only swipe once per meal period. The meal periods are for weekdays are:

Breakfast: 7am-11am

Lunch: 11am-5pm

Dinner: 5pm-9pm

Late night: 9pm-12am

Late late night: 12am-2am

I'm still not totally sure about the late late night thing, but the 19R averages around 3 meals per weekday and 2 per weekend. It's cheap, you get a lot of meals, but you just have to plan a little more. 19R for the win! 

**14R** Fewer swipes, less flexibility. Same as 19R, but you can only use 14 swipes per week. Good for people who either go home often or who skip breakfast and will be on the Hill to use their swipes.  

**11R** Least number of swipes, less flexibility. Good for people who go home on weekends.

hi so i have a class that relies heavily on a curve this semester and im kind of worried of having it ruined by other people cheating. one thing i was thinking of was what if a group of collaborators all had vibrators in their assholes with the remotes somewhere discrete, (think hoodie pockets). Maybe like one short vibration for choice A, two for B, three for C, and one long prolonged vibration for D. How would the professors/TA catch this? Maybe we can do strip searches before everyone enters the room or something.

I do have insomnia and take medication to go to sleep, but generally speaking I’m not a super super light sleeper, my
other roommate can come in at night and get their shower stuff and get dressed and whatnot and I don’t wake up. I generally go to sleep around 12-1, but my other roommate has been going to sleep at 5-7 am these past few weeks. The problem I’m having is that they constantly enter in and out of the room really late at night and make an excessively loud ruckus, turning lights on and opening drawers and digging through things on their desk so that things will fairly loudly fall onto the floor. I’m woken up pretty much every time this happens, and they will sometimes enter in and out and do this upwards of 10 times in a few hours between 3 and 5 am. Being an insomniac, I can get back to sleep a while after being woken up, but as soon as I’m falling back asleep, they tend to come back in and repeat, and I really need it to be fairly silent at least while going to sleep. And when they finally get into bed after coming in and waking me up once more, they’ll spend about another hour pressing the buttons on their phone so forcefully and repeatedly every second that it sounds like it’s right in my ear and I can’t get back to sleep.

All in all, am I being unreasonable here? Like, I can understand needing to very quickly come in and get something. I can understand going to bed late because you’re studying, I can understand going on your phone briefly before bed, but would I be out of bounds to ask that they get what they need before I start sleeping and try not to come in as much so late at night?"

I would have preferred to apply to the BS but after failing said classes it wasn’t even an option.  And it’s not possible to apply again.  Once you try and fail there’s no chance to apply again. And there’s no appeals.  

I really don’t know what to do at this point.  My past two years here have just been a series of fuckups.  My GPA is abysmal, my depression is getting worse, and I haven’t gone a single day without wanting to die in years.  It shouldn’t even be this bad!  Most people aren’t having trouble in the bio majors’ prereqs.  I always hear about how LS prereqs are easy As and how everyone has a godlike GPA and shit.  They’re right anyway, if you look at the data their claims are pretty accurate.  Most people come on this sub to bitch and moan about how they might get a single B+ in one of their classes this quarter, or how their internships aren’t as cool as their friends’.  And I sympathize with them, but fuck, I can’t even do anything right.  

Another problem is that I have no passion for anything in life, aside from sleeping I guess.  It’s not hard to like your classes and work towards a goal if you have something you like but I don’t have any of that.  I don’t like anything to do with school or life as a whole.  I promise I’m not being dramatic.  I can’t even enjoy shit like Smash Bros anymore because everything that used to make me happy is just a disappointing attempt at occupying my time now.  

I don’t know where to go from here but as always suicide seems like the best option.  Seriously how the fuck do people enjoy living, this shit is terrible.  Being born is a curse.

Also:

“Lots of people go through this it’s not a big deal” Does that really solve the problem?

“Just be patient and things will get better” I’ve told myself that lie for the better part of a decade.  Keep dreaming.

“Just talk to people you care about/who care about you like friends and family” 404 not found.

“Suicide isn’t the answer man there’s so much to live for” If you seriously believe that then good for you.  But there’s no better answer.

“Maybe you should take a gap year” And waste more time and money?  Good god what fantasy land are you living in?  I don’t have that luxury and it wouldn’t help regardless.

“Try to get some perspective” The only perspective I want is looking 30 stories down towards a concrete sidewalk.

Yeah that’s about it.  Hopefully I can salvage the shitshow that this year has been, but like with every other aspect of life, I can’t bother to have hope anymore."

And I normally consider myself an informed person who thinks critically about current events, tries to rationalize stupid things happening in modern-day politics, and, when necessary, adjust my own perspective when more evidence presents itself.

But I'm *really* having trouble processing who's running for USAC this year and who I should vote for.

It's hard to stay informed about this kind of thing when the candidates don't have any significant social media or campus presence until *literally the week the voting happens*. Because obviously during midterm weeks when people are busy is exactly the perfect time to share everything about your campaign and ask us to vote for you.

I'd love to care about this election, and sympathize with the different individual positions these student representatives are putting forward. I want to hear from you ahead of time, understand what makes you distinct from your peers, and really get to know you as a person and as a candidate. But when election week rolls around, I get like 17 endorsements from the Daily Bruin all at once of people I've never heard of before, I get dozens of reminders on Bruinwalk to ""do your responsibility to vote!"" and I'm left sitting at my laptop with the ballot open with 17 different names I can't even put a face to. Some of these positions *don't even have more than one candidate*.

Does this mean I should do more to research who's running and what platforms they're running? Maybe. But at some point, I gotta wonder why these candidates haven't done more to try to reach out to me. If I'm supposed to care about the election, it's the job of the candidates to engage us. It's their platform, after all. They've gotta make it their own. I'm sick and tired of being out of the loop all year about who I should be voting for and then, come voting week, BOOM! VOTE FOR US! WE WILL SOLVE ALL YOUR PROBLEMS AND WE'RE CLEARLY AND OBVIOUSLY DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER CANDIDATE DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE PRETTY MUCH WANT THE SAME THING. Please stop.

Please.

Stop.

I care too much about my responsibility as a voter to vote like this in haste. I want. To know. Why. I. Should. Vote. For. You.

But I cannot evaluate candidates in one week, and since you are also a student just like me, I want to know *who* you are before I vote for you. If it's not important to you to fully flesh out your positions and make yourself known more than one week in advance, then my vote probably isn't as important as you make it out to be.

I care about the direction our university is headed, and I care about the direction this country is headed. But actions speak louder than words. If you don't seem to care enough about this election to make yourself known more than a week in advance, then please don't be surprised when we don't care either."

I think that most of us can agree that the intro CS courses are not the most difficult, purely in terms of content. However, they were also extremely stressful because of how the courses were structured. Here are some examples:
-Tens and tens of pages of project specs, not particularly hard, but very tedious
-An automatic zero for a misspelled file
-Ramped up project difficulty during exam season
-Exams structured so that miss tracing a single line of code can cost you an upwards of 10%
-Gimmicky questions involving student ids, multiple bubbles
-Waiting until the last possible day to post grades etc.

CS 31/32 puts everybody in a pressure cooker, and sees who cracks first. It wears you out and beats you down mentally and constantly puts your sanity to the test. And as soon as someone goes “fuck it, I can’t do this anymore”, ding ding ding we have a winner.

I think the whole point of all this is to weed out people who can’t function under extreme pressure, and thus unprepared to pursue a career in computer science or engineering.

Now how does this related to the cheating email?

Well I think that this is another test.

I’m sure that no one in the class went up to a cave in the Andes to work in isolation. All of us were stuck or confused at one point or another. Most, I think, turned to outside resources for help. That, in my opinion, does not constitute cheating and I don’t believe the department thinks it does either. They don’t want to bust everyone who has ever been on github, but plant a little piece of guilt in everybody to see how it grows and blossoms in each individual. Again, they want to find out who is going to crack. Perhaps some were truly guilty, but I think many just let the guilt eat them away and convince themselves that they are guilty of a crime they did not commit.

So if you are thinking about confessing, ask yourself if you are truly guilty. Think about what you actually did and if the answer is just looking at github for inspiration from time to time, know that so did 95% of the class. Don’t crack."

This school is really hard, and if you’re an oncoming freshman, I want you to know that you’re about to get destroyed during your first few quarters. Don’t worry about it though, you’ll adjust quickly and you’ll bounce back. Yes, even you. 

One thing I do want to make clear though is to value your time here. Go to every sporting event you can. Attend the fundraisers like Spring Sing among others. Go to a few parties. Explore the campus and sneak into places you shouldn’t be. Don’t be stupid, but have fun y’all. But among all of those things, make sure to stop and take a second to remember what you have.

These have been the greatest 3 years of my life, and I’m sure for a lot of you it will be too. It’s easy to complain about the difficulty and to get homesick, but I promise, you’ll love it. I don’t know a single person who doesn’t. 

All in all I guess what I’m saying is, reverence is important. Remember where you are, and that no matter what’s going on, it’s a privilege to be here. It’ll be gone before you know it.

We definitely can’t afford what they’re asking us to pay. Because of that I frantically applied to a million scholarships, but almost all of them require proof of aid thru FAFSA.

Here are the classes I took, so if anybody needs any help with any of them, I'll be happy to do what I can:

Fall - Chem 20A, Math 31A, German 59

Winter - CS 31, Math 31B, English Comp 3D, Russian 90A

Spring - CS 32, Math 32A, Physics 1A, Astro 5

It took a lot of effort; I didn't have a particularly happening freshman year, it was mostly studying, but I don't regret it, since I genuinely love studying. 

We have an undergraduate research lab in the Physics department called Upsilon Lab where undergraduates themselves join as project managers and have other undergraduates work with them - I became the first freshman who became a project manager. I manage a project on theory and simulation where we tried to simulate satellite launching and motion in Python, and I also taught programming to other Physics majors who initially did not have experience in programming to the point where they could now create simulations for themselves! 

I know the path ahead is going to be tough, and a lot more work, but I just want to say that I won't give up, and neither should you. It is true that natural talent sets people apart, but I used to suck big time at Math when I was a kid - but with sheer hard work, things change. You're a Bruin, and there's a reason you are here. So give up those excuses and give it all you have, you too can achieve the sky!

Also throwaway because - this is personal stuff. Thanks.*

I did a total of 7 years for my bachelors degree. I am proud of that too. You will see why as you read this...

I spent 2 years at junior college &amp; 4 at UCLA. While I scored a 3.98 GPA in community college ... I had incredibly bad luck at UCLA. My first term during fall finals, my younger brother passed away. He was 20 - I was 22. It destroyed me and my final grades. 

Regardless, I went back winter term and had the best year from winter, spring, &amp; summer, then during the next fall term, as the anniversary of his death approached it all sunk in and I spent 6 months away working an intensive program to combat severe depression, trauma, and suicidal idealizations. 

After that I returned to UCLA for a term. Okay. Great. I thought I was back on track. 

However, I ended up physically ill that very next term. As it turns out I was diagnosed with a rare pancreatic condition. At that point my illness was so bad that I required a feeding tube. I was able to be off the feeding tube pump for a total of 4hrs. I'd go to class without it fully hooked up to the machine, go home take a nap without it plugged in because that thing was awful to sleep with and plug it back in after the nap.

Later on I got a little backpack and portable feeding set that I would bring around with me so I didn't have to be at home all the time. I was on the tube for 3 years total. I never made it to walking graduation. My illness took that from me because I was hospitalized during that time. 

The real kicker was my final four units of class. I failed the summer class to graduate. I was pissed. I was a few percentage points from a D, which would've allowed me to graduate. The Teachers Assistant in charge of this class refused to budge. He kept going on and on about academic integrity. I made things difficult and fully disputed my grade with the college. Mainly because I wanted some low-key revenge since he was constantly talking in class about how he was looking forward to having no work on his upcoming vacation. So, he ended up having to prove and justify his grade to me. 

In the meantime I returned that fall term and did nothing but study.

During that very last fall term the syllabus stated that anything above a 98% would be an A+. I was determined to get that A+ and finish off strong. I studied like my life depended on it. I felt the best way to handle a failing grade was to get an A+ right after it. Plus, it was my last and only chance to get an A+ - I'd never been able to get that kind of grade.

In the meantime sometime during that fall term I got copies of all the test results from other students (with names blanked out) to fight my failing grade, As I read through the finals I noticed this particular class TA was giving out full 0s for 5+ pages worth of content. They would hit the points but their description of them were kinda off. Not the best, but they certainly didn't deserve a full on 0 on what was 60% of their grade. Especially since most of the class, including me had a B average in that class going into the final. Meanwhile people who wrote 1-3 pages and answered concisely and ""perfectly"" got anywhere from a B to A grade There were no D's or C's it was either a 0 or B to A grade.

So, knowing I lost that battle, I responded with, ""*sounds like I wasn't the only person who was unhappy with their grade. Good to know  you're holding up the integrity of your class by failing most of us!*"" I got a message from the department dean or whatever telling me to be nice or they'd put me in violation of the student code of conduct. Which, was a load of shit. I just ignored the email and never responded to it.

After that finals week showed up for my class. I was a TTH &amp; this particular professor actually taught a MW class too. Well. That finals week the professor went missing. The department, was just as lost as the students. Since the final for the MW class had passed by the time the department made up their mind on what to do - their scheduled final had passed so they gave everyone there A's on their final. 

As for the TTH they made us take the final. - which I felt was wrong, but hey academic integrity over everything right?

I took it and scored a 98% making my overall class grade an A+  at 99% total according to the syllabus that the department said they'd uphold. Well, apparently the department decided to change one thing on the syllabus. The A grades. Since there was room for extra credit they gave everyone 100% &amp; above an A+ and anything lower was an A.  

It seems petty but I was pissed it was like just the last bit of salt in they could rub into my wounds. It would've been my only A+ &amp; I did feel robbed of it. At the end of the day I graduated with an annoying 2.956 .... 

.... &amp; I later located the professor. He had been locked up at UCLA psych because he had a mental meltdown or something..... I was about ready to join him. LMAO.

I graduated in December of 2013. I had the feeding tube removed in August of 2016. So, it''s been quite an adventure. Most of my 20s went to being ill. I didn't get a job or fancy internship right after school, I wasn't physically well enough. I also randomly required spinal surgery in 2016. I ended up struggling a lot emotionally and then in November of 2017 I met someone who would become my fiance.

Today, I am living my best life. I have a good job, my own place, no feeding tube, and a fiance. I couldn't ask for more really. I have people in my life that care and love me and I love them all back. I'm finally OK.

I share this story to encourage you all because I know UCLA can be very overwhelming at times, and i hate saying ""if I can do it you can too"" so instead, I'll say this: IF YOU WANT TO GRADUATE - YOU WILL.

**TL;DR** Brother died during first term at UCLA, went to intensive grief therapy a year later, got sick with a condition. Was on a feeding tube. Failed my last 4 units to graduate, returned fall term got an A (robbed of an A+) and finally graduated. Life right after college was rocky. Today, I am happy &amp; have a good job, &amp; a great life. It is possible to pull through anything."
ccjjpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/ccjjpo/a_trojan_weighs_in_honestly_about_the_whole_ucla/,"A trojan weighs in honestly about the whole ""UCLA vs USC"" debate",153,30,2019-07-12 18:32:13,"Hey there bruins, current trojan here (don't click away-- I think you'll like this). 

I did some summer residential programs at UCLA, so I'm pretty familiar with campus and know a little bit about student life there. According to two advisors from UCLA, I was on track to transfer there. But, I was admitted to USC the year before I could apply to UCLA (more courses were required for UCLA) and chose to go to SC because such a well-regarded and prestigious school has to be worth it, right? Well, after being there for a year, I have to say that not a day goes by that I don't regret my decision. SO, here are a few reasons why UCLA is \*FAR\* superior to USC, as told by a USC student:  
1.) RANKING: UCLA has always been ranked above USC (wish I checked this more thoroughly in hindsight), but even so, UCLA has been rising in academic ranking in recent years, even ranking above UC Berkeley this year. (Source:  [https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities) )  
(1A.) ""USC"" is underlined in red as I'm typing this, and ""UCLA"" is not lol.

2.) CAMPUS: UCLA's campus is not only twice as large as USC's main campus, it is far more impressive. UCLA has a more diverse look, with some buildings being red-bricked roman revival pieces and others looking much more modern. The Broad Art Center is also a unique place, with amazing art placed opposite a beautiful semi-forested area. USC is just a block of red-bricked building after red-bricked building, with a fountain here and there and a plain, grassy quad near the campus edge. The view gets boring VERY quickly. In every aspect, UCLA's campus is just better.

(2a.) The Greek Row. Holy shiznits. UCLA's Greek row is INSANE. The entire place is so beautiful, it almost blows my mind. Makes our row look like a tattered third-world village by comparison.  
3.) LOCATION: This one is by far the most glaring contrast between the schools in my opinion, and definitely my least favorite aspect of USC. UCLA is located in Westwood, a beautiful, thriving, and most importantly, very safe neighborhood. Students feel free to wander around at night, going for late-night coffee runs and the like. Overall, living the way college students are supposed to. USC, on the other hand, despite its reputation as an expensive rich-kid school, is smack in the middle of South Central, one of the ugliest, dirtiest, most crime-ridden neighborhoods in LA. The school takes measures to keep the students safe, such as having DPS patrols on-campus 24/7 and having ""yellowjacket"" patrols off-campus, but this obviously isn't NEARLY enough. Emails about students being victims of robberies and assaults near campus still pour in on a regular basis, and students have actually been killed near campus. Imagine paying $75,000 a year just to be mugged or worse. USC has been pressured many times in the past to relocate campus, but has refused to do so, not due to lack of funding (of course this school has enough) but for seemingly no reason other than stubbornness, so they're not innocent in this. USC does not have enough on-campus housing for everyone. Of course, this is the case at pretty much all universities, but if any school should be the exception, it's this one. So, students still wind up in rough situations while just trying to live the college life. UCLA wins this one by a landslide.  
4.)PRESENCE/VIBE: Probably my favorite thing about UCLA is how exciting it is just to drive up to campus. The feeling in the air shifts the closer you get, and there is anticipation building all throughout the trip. The road there is imbued with beautiful buildings and shops all over, almost as if indicating how close you are to this great place. Once you're on campus, there is a very unique air of intellectualism and happiness; it's really quite amazing. This is the way being on/near a world-class university is SUPPOSED to feel. Driving up to USC is nothing special, and you can honestly drive right past the campus if you're not paying close enough attention. Being on campus is dull, too; there is no intellectual vibe there. The air is void of any excitement or anticipation; it's largely an apathetic feeling being on campus. I felt this even on my first time there, while the hype of being admitted was still fresh on my mind, so I know this is not just my tainted view of the school clouding my judgement.   
There are so many more things I could add here but those are the big ones. There are some areas wherein both schools tie, such as affordability (recent graduates of both schools walk away with only about $22K in debt), employment rate (varies by school of study but both universities show similar numbers where available) and graduation rate (91% at both universities). So, UCLA has all the pros of USC and many more, with none of the cons. Hopefully you UCLA students have some more material to use next time someone hits you with the ""fUcLa"", and maybe a prospective student admitted to both schools will be swayed by this down the road. I envy you all so much and wish I could be a part of your great university, but above all, I wish you success!  
Tl;dr I am a USC student and can confirm that UCLA is ""A""-tier and USC is ""C-""-Tier."
c7u3l8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/c7u3l8/increase_in_bus_fare_is_ridiculous_and_needs_to/,Increase in Bus fare is ridiculous and needs to be addressed,136,56,2019-07-01 08:39:49,"Over the past couple years, taking the bus has become increasingly expensive. The program for Santa Monica Big Blue Bus increased. The quarterly pass in particular has become prohibitively expensive for anyone who doesn’t ride as often.

The bus is supposed to be a safe, convenient and affordable option. That’s why I was surprised when I saw that the fare with a BruinCard got increased from $.50 to $.80
That’s significant for multiple reasons. The first one being that it’s more expensive on the long run. The second one is impracticality, as the bus payment system uses coins exclusively. 80 cents is three quarter and 5 cents, or two quarters and three dime, which increases the need for coins per trip dramatically.

What I think is behind that price increase is UCLA’s increased funding for the Lyft program. UCLA is actively diverting funds from a necessity to put in a luxury product. Yes, Lyft is a luxury. When we see that a huge amount of those Lyft rides don’t even leave campus, this is a shame. 

UCLA constantly preaches about sustainability and empowering low-income individuals, well how about you stop promoting people paying more money to be driven in a private car? Not all of us have $10 to burn on a two-way trip to campus daily."

Last year, I lived on campus and received the same amount of aid, but had to take some loans because living on the hill is more expensive than off-campus.

Is it normal to receive the same amount of aid even if the cost for housing significantly drops (from moving off-campus)? Will UCLA change this, or does UCLA give roughly the same amount every year (and this reduction is only due to spending much less on housing)?"

&amp;#x200B;

I actually don**’**t have much of a problem with USC. Maybe cuz I**’**m not from LA so I**’**m not as aware of the rivalry and its history. But I don**’**t see USC as a threat to us academically. I view Cal as our main rival. 

&amp;#x200B;

I**’**m not too fond of Gene Block. Met him once and he was kind of a jerk.

&amp;#x200B;

UCLA Basketball is not a respected program anymore and probably won**’**t win anything for a long time; we**’**re living off of glory from the 60s. The recent coaching search is evidence of this.

&amp;#x200B;

Studying abroad is often times a waste of money.

&amp;#x200B;

The overly PC culture at this school is embedded everywhere and can be annoying. And this is coming from a staunch liberal. 

&amp;#x200B;

Complaining about walking to and from Hedrick shouldn't garner any sympathy, unless you've got a physical disability or something.

&amp;#x200B;

I think there are plenty of study spaces around campus if you stop discounting every other space just because it is not as luxurious as you prefer. 5th floor YRL ftw. Study in your room.

As someone who**’**s shy and has struggled making friends in the past, I think the obvious solution is to join clubs. If you don**’**t make friends joining clubs, you**’**re doing something very wrong."
chrl4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/chrl4f/annoying_apartmentroommate_rant/,Annoying apartment/roommate rant.,32,7,2019-07-25 11:31:17,"TL;DR: love my roommates as friends deeply and It’s great from all other standpoints, but as co-inhabitants, total lack of responsibility and common sense.

Ugh. I love my roommates, and they’ve been my core friend group for two years, but we’re moving into an apartment for this school year and I’m realizing just... how little... they know about living on your own and contributions they make. I’ll list as to not make it too long.

-they found this place when we had a perfectly fine one set (which I did the work to find!), backed out last minute, signed the leases ASAP. I had to go along Bc majority rules, but definitely noting every doubts about the landlord being sketchy according to reviews, and possible pests in [some] units.

-they want furniture from free and for sale/fb marketplace, but do little to no work in getting it. I’m responsible for getting what we’ve gotten so far: constantly checking feeds/pages, messaging people, negotiating down. 

-they don’t think about the bigger picture and logistics that come with things. Ex. The furniture. we don’t move in until the school year, but if you’re buying things off people *now*, it has to be stored somewhere (a wild concept, I know). Now I took the steps to get a storage unit, and my family happens to own a mini van, so finals week of spring, my family and I were picking up all these purchases, doing all the lugging around, and we’ll be the ones having to bring it back to our place. It’s so easy to rent a truck and contribute especially because we’re getting bigger pieces soon (couches, dining tables, beds), but like, when I message them about it, it’s crickets in the group chat.

-the alternative was buying nothing until we move in, but, since none of us had cars on our own, I don’t know how they expect us to collect and transport anything we bought, so it has to be the specific window of when MY parents and MY family’s car is available. (Yes, I’m shipping/getting delivery when I can with my personal purchases - Bc like, oh, I think about these things.) even small things like, are you gonna carry a microwave from target in Westwood or even if u uber, jam all your bags of purchases in there?

-For other furniture from stores, they literally don’t think about whether things will match or how to transport it from home. Like how are you gonna buy a cabinet, THEN ask me, who lives 2 hours away from you, if I can fit it into my family’s van again Bc you can’t bring it yourself? (and it’s ugly.)  Like just basic logic, so much of this can be bought in the actual area of Westwood, West LA, there’s Costco and ikea somewhere too. So it doesn’t neeeed to come from their area at all? 

-We even made a spreadsheet to log things we needed to buy/already had and can just bring form home, how to split payments (guess who thought of doing that. But they don’t even check or update it so there’s been small multiples of items. Again, I’m not pissed we’re gonna have like too many cups or anything, but the principle of carelessness and inconsideration behind it. 

-For payments, we’re breaking it up into equal parts to make up the rent, but it has to be one persons check so like we just Venmo or money transfer to them, but the landlord just wants one check for the place. The problem is, no one wants to handle it. I personally don’t want to Bc I have been doing everything so far, and I know I’d have to chase them down and give constant reminders and sometimes cover if they don’t get it to me in time (it’s not a case of they’re not financially able to, Bc they’re all supported by their parents, so it’s about the timely manner of just getting it all sorted monthly). Some were just kind of like silent on it and reluctant, and one of them straight up said, well, I’m not good with money, so nah I don’t wanna deal w it. Like.... you’re a whole ass adult? Someone else is already taking care of utilities and WiFi and cable, like, do something? They’re not spoiled or bitchy bitchy about it, but just had very capable parents that’s always figured it all out for them, so they don’t actually do anything independently. 


- Other stuff: I’m not trying to be scammed by my landlord or anything sketchy, so for the apartment inspection/tour, a) you have to make sure they give u it, b) have multiple ppl there like us or parents as witnesses, c) take notes of everything so they can’t pin you for it, and d) confront the landlord about things like pests in the building, this unit, etc so you have this all out in the open with, again, witnesses. They didn’t even think of any of this. If I wasn’t there, they’d just be too giddy about getting the keys and ignore things like asking if there’s plumbing problems or existing damages. 


Overall just annoyed that like there’s a lot of absence in common sense, initiative, and consideration. 

Yes, we’ve talked about it. I straight up said pull your weight, learn to multitask (bc I was able to manage this within the quarter and taking classes now too). They’ve gotten better, but still, it’s just micro aggressions and such a passive attitude adding up. Even now, I’m still doing most of it, so it’s like, now I’m probably building a rep for being the too pushy or uptight one, but like it’s only more aggressive because there’s such a lack of it from everyone else. I definitely have my shit together, almost everything I need accounted for, so we’ll definitely see who’s smooth sailing.

While it may not seem like it, the next application season is fast approaching, and tensions may be running particularly high for prospective students! From an admitted Bruin, here are some tips for getting into our beautiful, amazing, totally-not-scandalous-at-all university!

- *Just be rich!* Our esteemed athletic department simply loves to admit people who can financially support them. Best part is, you’ll get to choose what sports team you get to join, and you won’t even have to show up for practice once. A regular dream come true, huh? :•D

- *Be an athlete!* Here at UCLA we love to tell students we care about them, and that we’re not *just* a student body, but a *family* as well. However, just like any family out there, some children are just loved a bit more than others ;) If you have what it takes for the school to definitley-not-exploit you for financial gain, you’re welcome to join the True Bruin community, while making sure you’re treated far superior to the rest of those peasants who merely got here off *overrated* academic ability.

cxkpal,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/cxkpal/on_the_fence_about_withdrawing/,On the fence about withdrawing,67,29,2019-08-30 11:14:58,"I have eleven days before I fly out for orientation and I’m still on the fence about withdrawing.

For a little background, I’m an out of state first year from a lower-middle-class family in PA. My parents are divorced and neither have outstanding means to contribute much to the 45k per year, save for a 529 college savings plan that can fund my first year. Once that’s gone, I’d have to start taking out loans to fund three more years. I know, it’s comically a terrible idea.

In all honesty, I don’t even have a set major I want to pursue other than maybe political science, economics, or marketing. Why would someone in their right mind consider going over 130k into debt if they don’t even have a rough plan of what they’d like to do after college? Yes, I’ll admit this was fully my decision to commit to UCLA and I will own up to digging myself into this hole.

I guess I was so excited such a prestigious university accepted me that I was blind to the obvious financial burden it would place on me later. I had my mind made up as soon as I got my acceptance notification. I didn’t apply anywhere else in-state. The colleges I got into didn’t have the UCLA name or prestige. The campus was beautiful and every video on YouTube showed happy students having the times of their lives studying in Los Angeles.

I have sweatshirts and t-shirts to prove I’m a Bruin. My graduation party was UCLA themed. My coworkers made me a farewell poster decorated with blue and gold.

Since I left my job a few weeks ago the realization has set in that I’m trapped in this situation. For the past week, I’ve sat in my bed crying, not doing much of anything, trying to find an escape plan. I talked to both my parents about the financial aspect of withdrawing, telling them I could go to a local community college and transfer to some in-state public college. They suggested I just try out my first year there because the savings plan can fund it. I find that reasoning financially reckless but I think they just don’t want to feel embarrassed for me because I told everyone I could for the past few months that I was going to UCLA. 

I have a feeling if I do go, I’ll feel guilty for burning through 45k for an education mostly composed of GE’s with no purposeful direction. I’ll also constantly feel jealous of the in-state people who don’t pay non-resident supplemental tuition and have much better access to state grants and scholarships, who are getting that exciting college freshman experience and not worrying as much about the cost of the university. I know timing is terrible for me to reach this realization, but I could still receive a near-total refund for what we have put down in housing and fees, right?

I could really use some help, advice, or anything of use to help me make my decision or change my parents’ minds. Thanks."

When I heard that I could go I started to feel as though I had been accepted into a big corporation. I was the happiest i’ve been in a long time since I already had a connection to UCLA because of my mother being a UCLA  alumni. After months of waiting and many exams within those months the time had come. I live very far away from UCLA. In fact, 14 hours by plane. The whole thing flew by and felt like mere minutes however. The tension I had built up for months finally had released when I stepped foot into the campus. The image of company buildings and concrete started to decay as time went on. I had a whole 3 weeks worth of summer program. The first few of those days I had to rely on my phone to navigate around campus as it was enormous. I learned the name of buildings and the history of them mostly from hearing other people around me talking about them. When it was time to start the project I had signed up for I realized, that day, that whatever the result of the project ends up being is genuinely not important. Yes I’ve heard the saying a million times, but this was real emotion. What caused this were my mentors, who were all UCLA students. They actually gave a shit about what you have to say. Growing up where I lived, this was unheard of. I tried to spend time with my mentors as much as I humanly could and I succeeded mainly because of a single building, the makerspace (the one near engineering VI). I started every project I had piled up in my mind but realized I obviously could only finish a tiny portion of them. The three weeks   I was in my own world. Reality only hit when it was over. And it hit hard. UCLA is not easy to get in. I felt as if I was detached from my home when I came back to my “home”. I am now writing all of this with the hopes of somehow affecting something or someone.

Thank you."

I went to CCLE to turn it in at 11:59 and... the button to submit had disappeared. I would have assumed that 11:59 due time was *inclusive.* No one says ""due Monday"" and the last chance to turn it in is Sunday.

I emailed the professor at 12:01 A.M. who's not having it. I attached a screenshot of me being at the webpage at 11:59 and the files I submitted haven't been modified after 11:59.

My main argument is that if the cutoff time was so strict, the EXACT time to submit should have been denoted somewhere in the syllabus or project specification or anywhere. It was never said that 11:58 is the last chance to turn it in anywhere. I'm honestly just really scared for my grade and I can't believe *less than a minute* is going to tank my grade, possibly even fail me. Can I dispute this anywhere or to any office? What can I do?"

cu9e06,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/cu9e06/fourth_year_engineering_major_unsure_of_what/,Fourth year engineering major unsure of what comes next. Job? Grad School? Westwood Hobo?,34,37,2019-08-22 22:20:45,"Hi.  So I am an engineering major entering my fourth year here at UCLA and I have absolutely no idea what I'm going to do after graduation.  I'm pretty ashamed of talking about this with my peers because they all have their shit together unlike me, so basically I'm asking anonymously for advice here.  


Here's my situation: 
I majored in one of the smaller and lesser known engineering disciplines here at UCLA, which typically has a less clear path forward after graduation.  While some of my peers will land jobs straight out of university, a very significant chunk go on to graduate school.  I think this is due to the limited number of job openings for people with a BS in this engineering discipline.  Graduate school is not an option for me due to my sub-par GPA, lack of research experience, and my unwillingness to stay in academia for another 5 years.  

I am doing a technical breadth in computer science so I'm hoping that will make me more employable. I am also learning Python in my spare time. I doubt that I will be  able to learn programming well enough in this last year to land a coding job, but I am not sure how else to boost my odds of finding employment and to decrease my odds of becoming a wandering Westwood Hobo.  

So as I see it, my options are:
1) Try to land a job directly related to my major.  This is, imo, highly unlikely.

2) Take a lab tech position at a company that employees people with my degree, work there for a few months/year and pray that they eventually promote me to an engineering role.

3) Throw my engineering degree into the garbage, lock myself in a room for 1 year and learn Python/C++ well enough so that I can land an entry level programming job.  Alternatively enroll in some sort of intensive coding boot camp to refine my programming skills enough to get a job.

4) McDonalds is hiring, maybe even In-n-Out if I get lucky

5) Apply to jobs that just require ""quantitative"" or STEM degrees.  Can't remember off the top of my head what the positions were (I think in finance), but I saw a few that were not so particular about qualifications as long as you had a STEM degree from an accredited school. 

6) Sell all of my possessions and take out a massive loan; then move to some remote corner of the world to avoid the shame and embarrassment I have brought upon my family.  

Can you add any (serious) recommendations to the list? Or provide feedback as to which one is the best option to pursue?  I'll take any advice you people care to offer.



Thanks for your time,


- Future Westwood Hobo"

I've gotten the perception that USC is very... creepy and cult-like. Their marketing is ridiculous. It seems like they're trying to sell you a product, and it doesn't even appear to be a university anymore. UCLA isn't coercing people to come to their school and boasting about its network. Every page on the UCLA website gives the impression that it's a world class research university. I don't even see how USC is seen as a peer to UCLA. I'm from the east coast, and UCLA is well-known here whereas people think of USC as University of South Carolina. It's been established that UCLA has serious strengths and prestige around the world. I am 100% convinced that USC exists just so rich SoCal people can circlejerk about how private education is better than public schooling. And by paying your way into the school, you too can join the Trojan Circlejerk Network where you get off about how much better USC is than UCLA. 

I asked some people about USC vs. UCLA law and they couldn't deny that UCLA had better placement. All they said was things like ""our campus is better"". But taking a look at it, the USC Gould Building was much uglier than UCLA Law. No point to this post, just giving my perspective."

dac369,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/dac369/im_never_using_a_wheels_bike_ever_again/,I'm never using a Wheels bike ever again,44,1,2019-09-27 22:42:56,"Hey y'all, I'm writing this as sort of a rant, but mostly a general complaint about the way these personal ride-sharing devices (bikes, e-scooters, you name it) are managed. I like how, when we first got introduced to these a year back or so, it was *your* responsibility to obey the law and drive well, and everything seemed to work out just fine as long as you obeyed UCLA law enforcement, didn't bother others, and didn't ride in the dismount zones. But now that the bikes and e-scooters actually turn off the power when you enter these zones, that introduces a host of safety/accountability issues that I just can't tolerate any longer.

For example, Wheels has an arbitration clause. I learned about it the moment I signed up for the app. In other words, they effectively aschew the burden of responsibility for things that happen to you while you use these bikes (unless I'm really misunderstanding this, please someone correct me if I'm wrong). But that makes no sense, because they take the initiative to double check that you're in a no-drive zone with your location data so you can't be breaking any campus laws and such.

But here's where that gets interesting. The Wheels bike I used earlier today *literally stopped working in the middle of an intersection* because it mistakenly thought I was in a no-drive area.

So let me get this straight: I was driving where the law tells me I'm supposed to drive (in a road, not on a sidewalk, with a helmet on btw), and I'm not allowed to drive in no-drive areas (got it), BUT if the bike is wrong about where I'm located, and *literally turns off the power* while I'm in the middle of a roadway, it's not Wheels' responsibility (remember the arbitration clause) if I get hurt because the bike malfunctioned? I had to literally foot pedal my way to a sidewalk at 2-3 mph, which is totally not safe in a busy trafficway.

That is *a huge safety issue* to me and it is 100% a reason to never ride any of these devices. Look, I get it: I'm told to just look at the map, avoid all areas that are potentially no-drive areas, and you'll be fine. Except *the device* was completely wrong about where I was located and I got stuck *in the middle of the street* and had to walk my way out, and if I had gotten hurt as a result, I can't hold anyone responsible for it because of arbitration clauses.

Also, just to add icing to the cake, you can't park the bikes/scooters in several of the designated parking zones, because those are also mistakenly put in the dismount zones. Lol.

This is ridiculous. I'm never using a Wheels bike ever again. I may just save my money and never use an e-scooter either. If they want me back as a customer, they gotta fix this and give me a good reason to come back. I really enjoyed using scooters last year when it wasn't as stringent, but now I can't stand it, and I can't shake the uneasiness of this whole thing. Thank you for reading if you made it this far.

TL;DR If I'm understanding these arbitration clauses correctly, then these companies can basically wriggle their way out of being responsible if something happens to me because of their equipment being wrong about a no-drive area, which it already has, and it bothers me enough to stop using the bikes/scooters entirely."

If you're even thinking about rushing, do it. It's pretty much commitment free, you don't have to accept a bid. If anything it's something fun to do during zero week and you don't actually have to pay the registration fee unless you decide to accept somewhere. 

If you're more serious about it, do some research on the different chapters. Most of them have instagrams or websites you can fuck around on. Ask around if you know someone whos been at UCLA for a while.

Don't accept a bid until the last day. Trust me. It's good to have options. If you get a bid from a house, say thanks and go check out some other houses for the rest of the day. If you have multiple bids, you can meet guys who have accepted their bids at those houses already and see if you vibe with your potential pledge class.

Don't give too much merit to guys trying to brag or flex on you. Some douche in every house is gonna say they have the best GPA on the row or hang out with the hottest girls or throw the sickest parties or have the richest alumni or whatever, take it with a grain of salt. 

Every chapter is pretty much the same thing with a different twist. There's not really a wrong choice unless you really care about being in a top house. It's just about finding a crowd you fit in with, since you're gonna be hanging out with and probably living with those dudes eventually. 

Fraternities are fundamentally a non-profit business. You're paying money to be a part of an organization, so it should have something it can offer you beyond access to parties. Are there scholarships available? A test bank? What do they do as a chapter besides the stuff that every other house does? Leadership opportunities?

If you're thinking about rushing and have questions, fire away"

So I pretty much failed my first 3 quarters because of built up depression etc and wasn’t able to reach my academic potential I had when I was in high school.

I managed to get fully covered besides a small loan but because of the depression and feeling of being alone etc I couldn’t make it. I’ve taken about 5 months to recollect myself and I feel as though I can do it right this time. 

The problem is I got sent a letter in the mail that I owe 4 grand since I got a loan and failed my first year. I have no financial support since I have no biological family alive in the US and my hometown is 4 hours away from UCLA so commuting is not an option.

1) It takes exactly 3 full pumps to fill up a sauce container. (If you’re putting a lid on a ketchup container though only put 2.5 pumps as the ketchup is less viscous than the other sauces and overfilling will result in oozing out the sides.)

2) If you like ranch and buffalo sauce, try combining them in the same container. Exactly 1 full pump buffalo + 2 full pumps ranch will yield the most exquisite buffalo ranch sauce you’ve ever had *muah*

Note: full pump means from the pumps natural resting position all the way to the bottom in one single, smooth motion. 

Am I a loser for caring this much about sauce? Probably. If you have any other “De Neve Late Night Life Hacks” drop ‘em here."

So here are the rules: 

Submit a doodle of Gene Block in the comments of this thread. Try to be as creative and funny with it as possible. Hell it can even be a stick figure if you're not artistically inclined. Or if you want to go all out and create a masterpiece, feel free. Every submission will be considered for a prize--but creativity is encouraged. 

A quick review of the rules:

1. Submit a doodle of Gene Block in the comments. (use any artistic style/medium you want)
2. Incorporate the letters r/UCLA somewhere.
4. Sign it with your username at the bottom.
3. Be as funny and creative as possible.

I'll leave the rest up to your imaginations. 

The prizes will be four $25 Amazon gift cards. So there's a good shot to win. The thread will be up for a week or so. If there are a ton of good submissions I might reward honorable mentions.

I'm genuinely puzzled as to how such a ridiculous display of dynamic programming could be seen as fun. You don't have anything better to do than assign your variables as ""SuckMeProfessor"" ? Seriously, I feel sorry for you if this is your preferred form of entertainment.

I know a lot of you are too dense to realize that cheating and then walking away from it like it never happened and never responding to my emails that this will necessitate a meeting with the Dean of Students, but it’s not cool and should never happen. Not only is not cool it’s egregious to the point that I’m embarrassed to be a UCLA student right now. People who heard about our Computer Science curriculum were shocked when they learned UCLA students were acting like disturbed, stupid delinquents. And no, I'm not just talking about nearby wealthy people who get Chegg. People from all over LA heard about the story, both this latest one and the one from January that prompted a broadcast on TV from CBS Los Angeles. Think about it, people: hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of people throughout Southern California witnessed this lunacy in the sheets. Is this how you want people to view UCLA?? Do you not care about your school or its reputation? What about your own personal reputation?

Were some of you so pampered and privileged growing up that you can’t see the problem with this? If you weren't, what would your parents think about you acting like a bunch of clowns on the street?

I've been reading the comments in that thread and wow, the only thing I can say is they're absurd and outrageously ignorant. They are mind bogglingly dumb, hilariously nonsensical and immature. I honestly can't believe that students at one of the world's elite institutions are acting like a bunch of ninth graders after their build success. Did a bunch of Cog sci bros brigade this sub or something? What exactly is happening here? I only speculate that that's what's going on because I know there can't be such a large contingent of stupid people on here. It must be a concerted effort on the part of the people who organized last week's shitshow, which I believe is coming from those involved in North Campus life. I just can't fathom how there could be another explanation in light of the the level of stupidity displayed here.

Do yourselves a favor and knock off the copying crap. It’s unfair to students who want no part of it. It’s unfair to the professors and other students who never cheat; we have to use resources to baby sit you during exams instead of focusing on crimes like the recent burglaries on the hill.

For those of you who don't like Project 3 or our stances on C++: nobody cares. We are supposed to challenge the status quo and the common narrative. You're not supposed to agree with everything, you dolts.

And finally, learn to respect your fellow students. I know you all think we at the CS department are different from you, but guess what, we’re not. We’re people too. We like to read hacker news and have a good time like anyone else. But just because we don’t act like a bunch of middle schoolers, that doesn’t mean you have free pass to say whatever bullshit you want about us without a response. We’re not against parties. But we also don’t see the problem in calling out a horde of out-of-control wild animals like a lot of you were acting last week.

Do yourselves a favor, keep it indoors and off the internet. This whole thing is so lame and overdone."
dk6dso,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/dk6dso/rant_the_toilet_paper_at_ucla_is_the_absolute/,Rant: The toilet paper at UCLA is the absolute worst,101,27,2019-10-19 09:55:25,"Okay before I start, you need to know that I'm not some rich, snobby kid who drinks Fuji water and eats $15 sandwiches for lunch. So don't try to pull that on me. I'm sure 90% of people agree with me.

&amp;#x200B;

The toilet paper at UCLA is absolute shit. First of all, it's thin. You have to pull out two feet of it to actually get a usable amount. But that's not even the biggest reason why UCLA toilet paper sucks. It's the roughness of the material that leaves me regretful that I even decided to use the toilet.

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;DON'T READ THE PART BELOW IF YOU'RE EASILY DISGUSTED&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

This is kinda TMI, but when I'm done, I start out with a pretty long roll. The first wipe is no big deal, and a lot of shit comes along with it. The second is alright as well. Third is where you have to sort of dig in to get the residue, and you get some brown stains and you feel alright so far. Then, on the fourth or fifth, you start getting blood on your toilet paper and every next wipe is unpleasant, yet there are still brown stains but you have to endure the pain and keep on going. Painful isn't the right word to describe it, but that it's unpleasant. Sometimes, I just give up even though I know I have some shit left that needs to be wiped simply because I don't want to deal with the blood. Others, I feel grossed out and keep on going and keep on bleeding until my last wipe is free of any brown.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so to be fair, this kind of TP is practically in all business establishments and public buildings due to its low cost. And I get that. I bleed in those bathrooms too. However, UCLA is a university where students reside and study. That ""area"" has no time to heal when you're using that TP everyday. I think UCLA should provide better quality toilet paper. Even if it's just on the Hill and not on campus, that would be fine too.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anybody else feel this way about the toilet paper?"

But it doesn’t matter how few hours I study, I am always way ahead in the class and when new material comes I’m still too busy laughing at how easy the previous week’s material was. And with some classes I comprehend the material so much that I feel like I can’t go to office hours because I don’t even know WHAT to ask. I know it’s because there’s no need to study - I never seem to need much time to do actual practice problems, because I waste too much time playing games on my phone during class that it doesn’t seem necessary to do homework if I’m going to ace it anyway (right?)

Then shit is hitting the fan now that midterms are here. I hate overhearing conversations of “oh yeah that wasn’t too bad” from people I KNOW know what they’re doing in the class when I’m over here flying through exams getting As like nothing.

I just hate always being so ahead even though I love the material. It’s almost self-sabotage choosing to do something that I am so “gifted” at because I like doing it, but I can’t go back to acing everything and being bored. I feel like I should have gone to my local UC or Cal State to be a humanities or social science major instead, because based on the humanities classes I’ve taken there over the summer I could actually skip every class and still get an A.

There isn’t really a rhyme or reason to this post. Maybe just to get advice on how to fill my time, maybe to hear if there are actually other people out there who fly through their classes too. I just always feel like I’m the only one at this damn school."

#How do I check my Enrollment Pass?

Login to myUCLA. On the menu bar, select Classes &gt; Enrollment Appointments. In the drop down menu, select the quarter for which you would like to view your pass. For the upcoming quarter, select Winter 2020. Scroll down and you should see when your first and second passes become active.

#What is an Enrollment Pass?

An Enrollment pass is a time allotted to you for you to enroll in courses you need for the next quarter. Enrollment varies depending on which college you are in or if you are part of a priority student group, but everyone has two enrollment passes. 

If you are in L&amp;S and are not in a priority group you are limited to 10 units during your first pass and 19 total units (first and second pass combined) in your second pass. 

If you are in HSSEAS you are limited to 10 units during your first pass and 21 total units (first and second pass combined) in your second pass. 

Non HSSEAS and L&amp;S students can check their unit limit [here](https://www.registrar.ucla.edu/Registration-Classes/Study-List/Study-List-Limits).

If you are part of a priority group (regents, athletes, etc.) you should contact a coordinator in charge of your group for exact information regarding unit limits.


#How was my Enrollment Pass determined?

Enrollment passes are determined by the number of UC transferable units. This means the units from your AP, IB, or other credit granting high school program, that do not affect your UC GPA, do not count towards this number. Courses taken at CC or other UCs that transfer to UCLA do count towards this number. 

Enrollment passes are granted in blocks of time by seniority.

From earliest enrollment section to latest:

Students with 160 or more degree units and declared candidacy to graduate in next two terms

Students with 160 or more units

Readmitted Students

Students with 135–159.9 units

Students with 90–134.9 units

Students with 45–89.9 units

Students with 0-44.9 units

All students with the same seniority level will have their enrollment times determined randomly. The exact dates of these sections vary by quarter but can generally be found [https://www.registrar.ucla.edu/Registration-Classes/Enrollment-Appointments/Enrollment-Appointments]. For some reason this link still shows the the enrollment sections for Fall Quarter but should soon be updated for the Winter Quarter.

**Your class standing has nothing to do with your enrollment pass. Even if you took 100 units worth of AP classes and have Junior standing, you will still be in the 0-44.9 unit section if you have not taken any UC transferable units.**

#Now what? 

In a few days the schedule of classes will be posted. Using the class planner, you will be able to check at what time courses are offered and which professors will be teaching them. Plan your schedule according to your class needs but always remember to have alternatives in case a class fills up before your pass.

A guide on enrolling will be posted closer the actual enrollment date.

I’m referring to those who go above and beyond to be dickheads by yanking and pushing the door in frustration to as to communicate their disapproval with me being in there. One person even punched the door once and walked off! Wtf!

I know the big stall is the most popular stall because of the privacy and space it affords, but don’t be a such a child about not being able to access it when it’s occupied. Use another stall dickhead!! Very rarely are all 4 stalls on my floor’s bathroom in use at once. So, I know for a fact there are always other stalls available. And second, how dumb must you be to not to figure out the world’s easiest hack to determine if someone is in the big stall: check to see whether the lock is engaged! I know the little open slit between the door and its closing is narrow, but if you pay close attention you can clearly see a difference between a locked and open stall. The locked door has as a rectangular dark spot where the handle is: that’s the shadow of the lock and it means the lock is engaged and someone’s in there; whereas an open door will display empty space all the way down the crack. You can argue that this a detail too small for everyone to notice, but my vision is terrible and I was still able to figure it out fast. The fact that the large stall is visible from the end of the bathroom means you can catch this detail from a distance without ever needing to display your rude aggression.

Honestly, I’m not only annoyed because I’m in in there taking a shit, I do other stuff too. I wouldn’t ordinarily admit this but, since I’m so fed up, I’ll be honest and say that 40% of the time I’m in there masturbating. Before you give me any shit, I’d like to defend myself by saying I live in a friggin’ triple in Gardenia so beating off in my room is out of the question because my annoying roommate is constantly in there on the phone with his gf in Thailand. And when he’s out, my other roommate is on the bunk above me taking a nap. That means my own bed is out of the question. I rarely get the place to myself—especially at night when I usually get the urge to burp the worm. And let’s be real here: jerking it in the shower is also uncomfortable. Like who wants to beat off when they’re standing up? You would never beat off standing up in your room when you’re alone; it's awkward. Why the hell would you do it when you’re dripping wet and have class in 15 minutes and have to scrub your ass at the same time? That means the shower and my room are out as options: the only place I have left is the bathroom stall.

Put yourselves in my shoes and imagine when I’m in there on Xvideos on my phone, with only one of my earphones in ear because I have to try to focus and enjoy what I’m looking at and doing while simultaneously needing to be very alert with my other ear open to anybody who may walk in and hear me. Somebody pushing on that door in an annoyed manner is enough to disrupt my flow and even kill my boner. This has happened several times. And I wouldn’t complain about it for a single second if someone was genuinely trying to check the door. Because then I’d just chalk it up to an expected risk of doing my dirty deed in the bathroom. And for the most part, most people just quickly check the door with a light tug and then walk to the next stall. But that’s not what I’m talking about. It’s the small but vocal minority, the petulant and rude folks who push and pull on the door in an openly passive aggressive manner while jeering and scoffing in an indignant way as I did something to personally offend them. I’ve had enough of their crap.

Before you claim that I’m in there for too long, save it. I’m never in there for more than 5-10 minutes, which I believe is perfectly reasonable for anybody to be in a stall whether they’re taking a dump or stroking it.

And no, I’m not just writing this as a shit post, I’m genuinely peeved by this. It’s like every time I’m in there some dummy will come and pull violently on the door and then complain out loud about the door being locked. That annoys me if I’m taking a shit. But frustrates me to the 10th effing degree when I’m trying to pleasure myself. It’s hard enough needing to be quiet and discreet when I’m in there doing a little hand to gland combat, not to mention holding in any groans of pleasure, without having some big ugly brute banging on the door and audibly jeering when the stall is clearly occupied.

I understand many of you may think it is disgusting and obscene for me to do this, but I use a seat cover and clean up every time. So, I don’t really see a problem with anybody doing it as long as it’s so discrete it’s virtually undetectable. There are worse things in life than having a threesome with a couple of no-shows in a bathroom stall. But that’s an argument for a different time. I think for the most part, most of you, guy or girl, should relate to this if it’s happened to you because it mostly happens to those taking a dump. And we all have to do that.

Look, we all deserve a little alone time without putting up with petty passive aggressiveness. So for all you bathroom stall divas: take a chill pill and WAIT YOUR TURN. I know it's midterms season and you’re frustrated by all the work you have assigned, but don’t take it out on others—especially don’t take it out on the stall doors or the innocent bystander in there. Because I’ll be out in just a minute.

Thanks!"

I don't live on the hill so it's super hard to make friends. I keep trying to meet new people and make an effort but people rarely reciprocate. I managed to make a group of friends early on but I found out that I didn't really like two of those people and I don't enjoy myself when I hang out with them. I feel trapped in the group though. Since I have nothing else to do and no other friends, I hang out with them often anyways. Most of the other ""friends"" I talk to don't really invite me anywhere even though I try to invite them to hang out sessions with my group. Also I'm trying to make a new group of friends but it's really hard because everyone either just hangs out with their floor, mates or already has friend groups formed and isn't looking to make new friends. The only place that I can make friends is in classes and clubs but I never actually hang out with the ""friends"" I make in my classes and they keep contact limited to just academic stuff. Everyone has fun during the weekends but nowadays I just sit at home and watch TV and do hw. I did wonder if the problem was me and if I'm weird or something but I don't think so since I had a good number of friends in middle school and high school. Its too bad that I had bad luck with my first group of friends which wasted a lot of my time that I could have used to talk to other people. I've seen other posts about how if you don't make friends your first quarter you're basically gonna be lonely for the rest of college so I guess the only thing I can do right now is try my best to make friends.

Should I be fine skipping the Spanish 1 class if I took up to Spanish 3 in HS? I don't know how advanced the Spanish 2 class is, but I did it so I could take 3 in Spring Quarter and fill the requirement so I could graduate this Spring.

I broke up with my girlfriend a few months ago because the stress from our responsibilities (classes, extracurriculars, work) were starting to take a toll on our relationship. I knew she'd never be the one to call things off so one night after a huge fight I decided to call it quits. At first it was sort of liberating but lately I've been missing her more and more. Talked to a couple girls to take my mind off her but over the past month I've been realizing she's the only one I want.

I've been wanting to talk to her to try to work things out but I don't think I'm worthy of a second chance. I'm pretty sure she hates me now too. It really sucks because we have classes together next quarter (we're the same major) so I have to see her 3x a week and not seeing her at all this break has already been shitty coz we're from the same hometown and everything reminds me of her.

The professor himself said that he did not witness anything but since I've been reported by another student, then he will be referring me to the Dean of Students for resolution. A TA even came by and answered some of my questions in view of the phone but didn't make any comments about it. I did not cheat, as I would rather fail than to cheat as my integrity is priceless, but what's the process now? Of course, I will deny any wrongdoing since I didn't and wouldn't cheat, but I have a few questions regarding the process now:

1) What happens when you meet with the Dean of Students? What does s/he say to you?

2) Are you assumed to be innocent until proven guilty? 

3) Is the burden of proof on the accuser/professor?

4) I know that if the Dean of Students determines that there is not enough evidence, then they can dismiss the case. How likely is this, especially if it's just hearsay from another student and the professor or TA didn't see anything. (https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/Portals/16/Documents/flowchart.pdf)

5) Would it be possible to offer to retake the final exam or oral interview for the exam to show that I actually know my stuff? Would this help my case to prove my innocence?

If he's a scam and he keeps touching people without consent, why does UCLA let him stay on campus for literally decades? We might as well just give him an honorary degree at this point.

Also, why is he only active at UCLA? Why not USC where there are more rich people? Or some other place like Santa Monica College etc

Lastly, does he really believe that ""'Scuse me boss, can I askya question?"" and ""Ladies, caniaskya question please, question question question"" is truly the best marketing tactic to intrigue students to whatever he has to say?

Anyways, I applied to care extenders and didn’t think I would get in... and I got in for winter rotation but honestly... it’s some shit. Orientation, the vibe of the program, and THE COST (I mean the uniform, if you don’t own tan pants and white shoes, can easily total $60+) made me sooo bitter, and I feel like care extenders isn’t worth the amount of stress it would be introducing into my life. In addition to my non-healthcare job and other hospital volunteering, I feel a little stretched thin. Do you think care extenders is worth sticking around for? And I know experience is experience and that will help me get jobs in the future (like medical assistant) but I’m not sure if this is the *right* experience. Any insight would be great.

The day that all of my sorrows would finally disappear. However, I was only met with disappointment. As I walked past the laundry room, staring down my enemy, the bane of my existence, I felt satisfaction, belief that it would be dealt with, defeated. I passed the hours by sitting in lecture, awaiting for when I could return to see my precious laundry back in my arms. When I had finally returned to my residence, I was left distraught. The demon still lingered. It’s influence loomed over me like storm clouds. This nightmare of a washing machine would give up so easily.

I waited longer in my room, doing meaningless work, everything had become devoid of meaning since the incident. Seconds turned to minutes turned to hours. I wanted to scout the laundry room one last time before I gave in, however all I had to do was get near to feel the dark aura permeating from that room. It lingered. I cut my losses and made my way once again to the front desk, my only bastion of hope. Once I arrived, it was as if I was greeted by doomsayers. They did not provide hope, only a dreary reality. Today was the last day before the creators of the machine would vanish from existence for the week’s end. I would be left alone, abandoned. How could I possibly last for three whole days with no power at my disposal to combat the washing machine? I hold little influence over my own destiny in this affair. This frightens me. It shakes my very core. Threatens my being. How I wish I could be near the final correspondence regarding the situation. It seems as if this turmoil may never end. Be wary friends. Your humble words and offerings have aided me in surviving this strife. I would not desire the same fate to fall upon one of you. Remain vigilant."

This is not the first time, either. It's funny though, part of me is relieved that I got caught: I will no longer have to spend restless nights worrying about potential consequences. Potentiality has turned into reality and now I await my fate.

God only knows what will happen. This time last year I faced a similar dilemma – either turn myself in to confess or hope that I could slip through the cracks of the investigation and get away scot-free. I chose the former. And, fortunately for me, I was given a second chance. I highly doubt there will be a third. There will be no mercy this time.

I know; I did not learn my lesson from last time and, ultimately, wholly deserve what is coming.

I used Chegg for my math final and, any minute now, will receive an email confirming my involvement. My IP address is waiting only to be discovered and traced back to me. The evidence is definitive, I cheated. There is no fighting it now; what’s done is done. I know that this will not end well, not in the slightest. 

I don’t know why I did it. I have no clue why I wasted a second chance. I guess my penchant for exhilaration got the best of me. Perhaps it came from an illusion of invincibility: having gotten away with it once triggered my hunger to be audacious. I needed to push the boundaries. 

Perhaps in another life I was a gambling addict. Maybe I simply needed to feel alive: to teeter the fence between boredom and danger. But alas, I could not keep my balance. And the ramifications will be soon felt. 

Pity me if you will, but I do not seek your pity. I simply share with you my mistakes so that future students may avoid my error, lest they end up in the same position as me. 

As for the rest of you guilty of these misdeeds, I wish you good luck. Our IP addresses are logged and there is no point in fighting it. We cheated. And now, it's only a matter of time. 

Sorry again. I do not know what awaits me but I would like to thank everyone for being so helpful. Take care now.

I'll say a few words.

I'm a Physics major who's in the second year and entered Junior status this quarter. For this once, and only this once, I won't hide or lie. I have a 4.0.  I have only gotten two A's so far, the rest have been A+'s.

Things don't come easy, I am not saying that. I've had to work day and night, while being miles away from home (international student). I took Corbin for the Physics 1 series and got A+'s, but that was NOT EASY. I took this insanely difficult professor named for my Mathematical Physics class, his name was Putterman, and got an A+ but that was not easy. 

I have a position as a spacecraft operator at ELFIN and am a Project Manager at Upsilon Lab. But it's not just names, I have to work, and it is stressful. And I want to help people, genuinely, to find their own calling and do the best they can. I am still clueless as to why I get downvoted for giving any sort of academic advice to anybody.

None of this was easy. I have to work hard, very hard, but I take classes just for the fun of it, to learn, to enjoy, to see the beauty of the universe. My purpose isn't just getting grades.

I acknowledge that I'm fortunate to have amazing parents, a very supporting girlfriend, and great friends, but I still believe that I've made my academic record at UCLA with my own hardwork. 

Not all people who do well are jerks. I've been in the struggling half of the curve too. I know how it's like to want to improve but not have any guide, which is why I want to be here.

I genuinely try to help people find their ways for studying, because I know how it feels to not have somebody to help. I don't charge half a penny to answer people's questions, try to be very kind, very humble, and very understanding. But, somehow, I always get shot down on this subreddit so I have started to stay mute. 

I still have miles to go, but I don't want to go it all alone. I want to help as many people achieve their dream as many as I can. But I can't do anything if the people don't want to take help, or even talk.

This is probably the last time I'll speak up this way. You can downvote all you want. And for god's sake this is NOT a shitpost. Thank you."

Encourage lectures to be both broadcast live and archived for future watching

Set up detailed tutorials and seminars for professors on how to best utilize technology in their teaching

Encourage classes (when possible) to move away from a traditional exam format in favor of collaborative assessments, essays, or other grading schemes.

I get the need to keep this disease from spreading and I agree that shutting down these facilities, where a lot of people congregate, will help in limiting spread. But the way that UCLA has implemented these policies shows that the administration is really incompetent. 

After refusing to suspend in-person classes for so long, UCLA suddenly decides to go forward with it and announces that it would suspend in-person classes for two weeks. Yet none of the faculty were given training or support to conduct online classes and migrate exams online. As a current TA, it was extremely inconvenient to suddenly shift everything online and coordinate with the professor and students. Then a few days later, it suddenly becomes the entire spring-quarter. Now this. Can UCLA administration get their shit together and work out a coherent plan?

Without this push, the UCLA Academic Senate's ""changes"" from last week are essentially useless. The majority, if not all, of the departments at UCLA have refused to alter their policies to help their students during this immensely stressful time. Students are still forced to take letter grades to get major credit and graduate on time. Student wellness should be a priority!!

This allows students to have the option to take classes for a letter grade or on a pass/no pass basis.

4.) Extend due dates

However, I personally don't think that the LS core is being considerate of these points as they're literally forcing us to take the final exam online as scheduled and also have given little to no information as to how to prepare for the final exam. With all of the chaos that has occurred over the past few days, I personally think that the LS core is not very considerate of the various situations that many students are going through as so many students have to deal with the fact that they have to move out since spring quarter is online and honestly final exams are the last things on anyone's mind as of now.

Hello, I am a DESMA student, and our final in typography was to design a physical book of all our work from the quarter. When this whole corona thing happened, the form of submission was changed from physical to PDF. This was deeply disappointing for 2 reasons: 1) some of us had already dropped hundreds of $$ on paper, test prints, dummy books, etc 2) many of our books have physical elements that wouldn’t be the same on a PDF, for example, cutout pages, pop outs, mini books inside a larger book, &amp; so on. I’m so sad the work we’ve all put in won’t be realized. This is a final that cannot be canceled, as our entire grade is based on this one book. We did get a 2 day extension but the stress is still more or less the same. 

Today we also got an email stating that Form, an essential prerequisite and major class has been canceled for spring. It makes sense, as I can’t imagine remotely learning to woodwork or sew or 3D print. But still, many of us are left without a class and struggling to enroll in a new one.

I wake up at like 12, look at my phone for an hour, waste another hour showering and eating lunch, sit around for another hour, and maybe do some classwork at like 4 PM then the day is already kind of over.

I know I should get out of the house for exercise but I just can't be bothered right now. 

I kept my apartment at UCLA, initially not realizing how bad things were going to get, then it was really too late to sublet it. I only live an hour away so I thought about going back but there's no reason anymore plus my roommate did get a subletter so there's a stranger in my room.

There’s a confirmed case on coronavirus on campus and I’m supposed to go home to 3 elderly parents and grandparents who are at high risk of contracting it, and now I’m not sure if I should go or stay and risk being stuck in LA for an indefinite amount of time due to talks from Trump regarding lockdown of high density cities like LA. 

I just cannot focus at all because there’s just so much to do and to consider regarding my everyday life that I can’t think straight. 

I really wish LS would atleast consider letting us opt out of finals because at this point the final is an inadequate examination of what I’ve learned and will only hurt me. I will gladly take whatever grade I have in the class right now even though it’s not an A. 

I’m thinking of emailing Pires and the other LS professors regarding this. Anyone else planning on doing so? I’m just so lost. I don’t know what else to do."

We can and we will get through all of this 🤘🏽 I know some of us had to go back home, I know some of us had to stay on campus , some of us have roofs under our head some of us don’t. I want to remind y’all that some of the things we are facing right now could be worse. I also want to remind those that have a fear of not being able to succeed during this time because of distractions at home, that you shouldn’t worry of somethings that have not happened yet. Don’t worry about them don’t worry about the professors, the cheating, the self isolation, just take it day by day. If you miss your friends call them, FaceTime them ☺️ I know it’s a bit hard and it’s not the same but it’s something you can consider. And about the grades, there’s been times where I’ve given it my all and sometimes I don’t get the result I want. Focus on what you can control and stay safe for your family and friends. The less you worry about what you can’t control the happier you’ll be. You can’t control what will happen in 2-3 months from now, you can’t control how the professors decide to grade, but you can focus on taking care of yourself and doing the best you can do ❤️ whatever is meant to happen will happen so don’t beat yourself up for it !

Whenever I look at the grade distributions on Bruinwalk for the LS series, there's always a lot of A's and B+'s.

I got an A- in 7a, B+ in 7b.. I usually don't really care about these classes because I'm an engineer and I have a lot of much harder classes, but it's nice to have the 5 unit grade boost (yes, I do shitty enough in the chem 20, 30, phys 1 series that those grades help my GPA, sue me, I'm not a premed).

I never really knew about the grade distributions, but saw that I'm like exactly average or slightly below the averages Khankan mentioned (which is confusing because my percentile ranking on my scantron sheet says otherwise). Should I be worried about getting a C or B-? or will I just get the average grade (50th percentile), which seems to be an A to A- on Bruinwalk?"

In total, USAC allocated $10,256,222.74 to various on-campus programming and student services for the 2019-2020 academic year. Of that, **only $3,782,516.50** has been expended since August 2019. Not only was this a **massive** miscalculation on USAC's part, the remaining $6 million+ will obviously not be used in full due to spring quarter being online.

I'm looking on the bright side and assuming that the money allocated for learning projects, hunger projects, the dance marathon etc. will be donated to the causes they support. I'll go ahead and set aside $2 million of the available money that ought to be donated.

That leaves them about $4 million. **If anything, they should be giving each undergrad a $100 refund, while trying to increase fees should be the last thing on their minds.**

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a list of their most interesting miscalculations if youre interested, raises some questions about how exactly our tuition money is being spent.

 **1001 Campus events**: $60,533.78 allocated; $23,094.30 expended. Unless they were planning to go crazy with events in spring quarter it seems like they would end a normal year with about $25,000 extra cash

**1103 CEC Film programs**: $35,475.02 allocated; $17,314.57 expended. Same point as above, seems like they would have ended this year with about $10,000 extra.

**1101 Community Service Commissions:** $432,976.29 allocated; $168,539.45 expended. I'm interested if anyone knows how much they have spent on this in previous years because it looks to me like a disastrous overestimate?

**1110 CSC Alternative Breaks:** $11,545.76 allocated, **$0** expended. **(??)**

**1201 Cultural Affairs Commission:** $110,075.29 allocated, $77,013.50 expended. ($60,000 of it was spent on Bruin Bash alone.)

**1125 Cultural Programming Fund:** ***$119,370.15 allocated,*** ***$14,948.25*** ***expended***     WHAT

**1227 CommUnity:** $22,500 allocated, $0 expended.  once again WTF

**1401 Facilities Commission:** $41,520.09 allocated, **$8,317.76 expended. (???)**

**1601-1603:** (Representatives 1, 2 and 3 were each allocated about $3,400. For some reason, Representative 2 only spent about $430 of this, while Representative 3 spent **none of it**.

**1604:** The transfer student representative was allocated $13,007.37 and only spent $1,137.97 of it.

**1605:** The international student representative was allocated $7,017.18 and only spent $842.77

**1701 Student Wellness Commission:** $89,327.83 allocated, $29,507.66 expended.

**1713 SWC Total Wellness Newsletter:** $25,651.91 allocated; $5,398.44 expended

*(SWC was given a lot of money that they could never possibly spend by the end of the year.)*

**1801 External Vice President:** $113,087.70 allocated; $55,604.32 spent. FIND THIS PERSON

**2103 Administrative Overhead:** $677,734.52 allocated, $416,990.09 expended. This only caught my eye cause thats a LOT of money moving around.

**2121 Campus Retention Committee:** ***$1,434,314.28 allocated, ONLY $511,439.59 EXPENDED.*** *WHY AREN'T THEY USING EVERY CENT OF THIS TO HELP THE STUDENTS THAT NEED IT MOST???!?!*

 **2127 Student Initiated Access Committee:** ***$1,276,276.29 allocated, only $456,918.02 expended.***

**2132-2138:** About $670,000 total was allocated for various social justice programs. **Only \~$270,000 of that was spent.**

**2901 Green Initiative Fund:** According to UCLA's website, roughly $200,000 is available to the Green Initiative Fund thanks to student fees ($4 per quarter beginning in 2008 and continuing for 10 years.) This year the fund was allocated $780,364, while it expended just $141,623. (I honestly have no idea what's going on here)

It was incredibly one sided, as GenRep after GenRep criticized Rep Orion for his opposition to the referendum. They were honestly incredibly belligerent to him, while simultaneously being dismissive to any concerns about the fee increase.

At one point Rep Kelechi went on what can only be characterized as a rant, and told everyone against the fee increase to ""literally leave the chat"" and essentially shut up and go away.

There was also a Rep who claimed that there was no way to make an accurate plan on how to spend the money because it was ""too complicated.""

Overall I feel like nobody that I listened to from my \~30 minutes in the call was willing to actually criticize the fee increase, mostly because the Reps painted dissent as being ""anti-black"" (their words).

I would say that they are ready to go charging ahead with the fee increase if we allow this narrative to dominate.

I personally don't think we are racist because we demand financial accountability from USAC, and it certainly isn't racist to question why we pay nearly 3 times as much as Cal to our Student Union.

Public hearings are every week on Tuesday. To be approved you must have a UCLA email on your Zoom account. If you want to hold USAC accountable for their spending and prevent them from hiking up their fees, please show up and respectfully voice your concerns alongside your fellow bruins.

Update #1: To USAC's credit, they are currently trying to force Asst. Vice Chancellor Deluca to provide an audited report of the missing $2.7M from the CPO.

Update #2: It seems that there are students demanding fiscal accountability from the university. It does not seem to be entirely USAC's fault for the CPO and budgeting issues, but I'm confused why they cannot see the causality between their inability to track funds and our distrust of the new fee hike.

Update #3: They apparently have refused to fund the CPO until they present a proper budget. W.

Update #4: The CPO seems really against providing transparency. It's alarming. Also

&gt;the questioning of funding for spaces that directly support students or color is racist

was pretty much all the CPO board had to offer to defend their lack of a budget.

g1m2oo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/g1m2oo/the_proposed_45_usac_fee_and_its_effect_on/,The proposed $45 USAC fee and its effect on students,76,10,2020-04-14 22:54:20,"The thing about this fee, especially during a recession, is that $45 dollars equals a week+ worth of food and that’s the difference between being fed or going to bed hungry. That’s a few days’ worth of necessities and groceries for many poor, struggling students. The lack of transparency is disappointing. No one has an idea was USAC is doing behind closed doors. From the exposed GroupMe to myriad other things, many USAC members are just as corrupt as politicians. $45 dollars x ~40,000 students is how much again? We’re talking about millions of dollars here. What even happened to the money this quarter if barely anyone is using it due to the pandemic? You say that it’s gone to some vague relief fund. But why not simply refund students instead? That’s where you could’ve done something positive. But you FAILED miserably.

All this talk for equality and seemingly NOTHING has been delivered by USAC and yet you are still getting our money. What an absolute sham of an organization. I’ve seen other student orgs doing more observable good for the public than the sham that USAC can deliver. And they don’t require millions of dollars. Their argument is essentially that “Anyone who opposes is racist...” It’s so absurd. They’re trying to shut people up by guilting them. They’re trying to shut people up by labeling them racists. They don’t want people to have opposing opinions.

They think people should just blindly follow their fellow “leaders” because they and their fake ass smiles act all “passionate” about a cause they “believe” in. Give me a break. PEOPLE ARE UNEMPLOYED AND STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW. Until you can clear how that works with anyone, the new referenda should be shut down. For someone who claims to stand up for students, it is YOU who should be ashamed of yourselves. I really hope USAC members never become politicians, because they’d only be adding to the current stock of corrupt and incompetent leaders.

The bottom line is that as much as I want to support my fellow students at UCLA, $45 is such a big raise considering the current situation. I understand that it will help benefit certain groups that I am apart of, but how can I help others when my family and I are barely hanging on? Both of my parents lost their jobs, and we are worried about how to make rent (our landlord refuses to lower the cost and we could possibly get evicted). $45 may seem little to people who have the money, but for someone like me THAT’S A WEEK WORTH OF MEALS. Or $45 that could go towards our rent, utilities, etc. I’m sorry. I may be “selfish” but we need to survive too. I’m watching my parents struggle EVERYDAY and it breaks my heart. We were already struggling but now it’s so much worse. 

I really hope USAC doesn't get away with this."

Doing very well academically, so I guess I don’t have the right to bitch, but I can’t help but feel like the only thing I’m really learning how to do here is cramming/memorizing information and dealing with the stress and uncertainty of grading. Even in some of my theory-heavy STEM classes, it feels like the common approach to teaching/testing is designed to favor memorizing problem solving strategies rather than actually focusing on a deep understanding of the material. 

When it comes to reaching out to other students with the same interests, I feel like everyone else is just consumed by their own stress and not really willing/open to discussing the material beyond a google doc study guide and anxiety-riddled cram session. I don’t blame them though as I find myself guilty of this. 

I’ve been able to adapt to this just fine on paper, but I feel like the toll it has taken on my physical and mental health isn’t exactly worth the reward I’m getting. The reward being engagement with the material beyond just the “oh my god will this be on the test?!” level. 

I definitely expected this school to be much harder, and it is... but I’m starting to get the impression that most of this difficulty is sort of inflated. 

I guess if you’ve been here since freshman year you don’t know anything else and you just get used to it. But maybe for transfers it’s part of the transition process. 

Idk, I’m I just being an ungrateful asshole or is this a common experience among other transfers?"

This is not the time to increase student fees.,16,185,2020-04-09 11:48:18,"USAC should honestly be ashamed of itself. [They want to increase student fees by $15.33 for every student.](https://dailybruin.com/2020/04/08/usac-approves-candidates-and-referenda-for-online-spring-2020-election-ballot/) In light of so much uncertainty right now - the fact that we don’t even know whether we’ll be back on campus in the fall - it is a complete joke that they propose an increase in fees.

Due to COVID-19 many of us are out of work. Many of us are barely scraping by. Many of us have our finances tied up in helping our families. A non-insignificant number of us are financially independent and need every dollar to weather the crisis. And yet, during a time like this, more of our money should go to USAC? The $9 million they collect every year currently isn’t enough?


Many students are facing severe financial burdens and for them to add to that at a time like this in incredibly poor taste. I mean, are they tone deaf? They should honestly be advocating for lower student fees given that the student body is not even on campus to utilize all the “resources” they offer. They should instead offer a refund on fees. But what do they choose to do? Increase fees! It’s detestable.

If a significant portion of their programming is not available because of the current pandemic, that suggests that money will remain unspent and available in their budgets. The programming costs have shrunk to almost nothing I assume, with NOBODY on campus, and no resources being offered. Therefore, they should REFUND this unused money back to the students instead of keeping it all and asking for MORE. They cannot he serious right now.

The truth is that USAC relies on low voter turnout and low voter awareness to essentially pass whatever referenda they want. They know most people don’t pay attention, and know whatever they put on the ballot is almost guaranteed to pass. When they’re the only people voting, they get what they want.

Be that as it may, the student body is NOT a blank check. You cannot shake us down for more money at will to fund vague “new” programs that 90% of the student body will never know, use or hear about.

The fact that USAC wants to increase student fees when one of their offices [refuses to account for $2,000,000 in funding is absurd.](https://dailybruin.com/2020/01/14/public-information-is-lacking-for-over-2-million-used-by-two-campus-committees/) They don’t even have their finances in order, yet they want another half million dollars to add to their already inflated coffers? Are you kidding?

Please spread the word and vote NO on both referendums starting May 4. Don’t let USAC get away with it this time. They’re counting on low voter turnout and awareness to get this passed when everyone is distracted. But this time we’ll be prepared! Please keep USAC accountable.

If this where the case what do think would occur with on-campus housing? considering that a lot of people would not sign up for housing for the fall if the classes were online. Would they allow us to sign up for housing again just for the 1 or 2 quarters? If yes, would it be the same housing offer we had prior or would we just restart?

Basically, do you think it is just better to live in housing during the fall just in case the classes become in-person again?

gudi39,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/gudi39/a_message_about_finals/,A Message About Finals,19,16,2020-05-31 20:59:34,"I'm an older UCLA student. Much older than nearly everyone on this sub by several decades. I've experienced a fair bit of civil unrest and other catastrophic disruptions during important times in my life (this being one of them), and I'd like to offer a bit of humble advice to those that would hear it:

Now that the tone of the discussion has shifted toward students having difficulty maintaining focus in times of unrest, it's important to realize that how you decide to handle this situation may very well determine the trajectory of the rest of your life. There are many here adamantly expressing the desire for finals to be cancelled/adjusted/whatever. Whether or not that's the right call is irrelevant. What is clear is that many, if not most of us, will still have to take our finals and will still be required to excel in order to move forward with our lives.

It is EXTREMELY difficult to process the sorrow, sadness, frustration, outrage, anger, fear, and every other overwhelming emotion flying through nearly every information outlet around us right now. This sub, social media, TV, news, YouTube, etc. Finals are enough pressure alone without the feeling that the world around us is burning (literally, in some of our cases).

However, and this sentiment is something that many here may strongly disagree with, I would encourage anyone feeling the desire to say FUCK IT and give up to instead steel yourself and study your ass off this week. Don't let these new challenges surrounding you break your resolve. Finals are a week away, and I can guarantee that giving it your absolute best effort, especially in times of strife, will allow you to look back on this time with a small sense of pride that you gave it your all (despite the outcome). If you don't give it your best shot, especially in this final stretch, reasoning away your performance on these horrible circumstances (perhaps understandably, even) will be of little solace if it costs you opportunities in the future, many of which you aren't aware of yet.

Please don't misunderstand: what you are experiencing is a defining moment of your generation. Possibly even a revolution. But make no mistake, when the dust settles, most of the world will still be unfair, and you shouldn't give the system an opportunity to close a door on you when you have it in your power right now to succeed, even if it may be one of the hardest things you've ever done.

You can do it. You've got this."

gl1bwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/gl1bwv/the_truth_about_ucla_finance_and_consulting/,The Truth About UCLA Finance and Consulting Recruiting,15,117,2020-05-16 13:03:31,"THIS IS NOT A SHTPOST. So I recently saw something on WSO about UCLA being shtty for finance recruiting, and decided I might as well make a post here to educate everyone about it. As an alum on the east coast who had to grind just as much as a non-target, no name state school kid had to, I feel like I should write a post to well-inform potential incoming students before they end up committing to UCLA. However, note that I was in one of the clubs, so I was still lucky to have mentorship from my upperclassmen.

UCLA, for a school with a 12% acceptance rate and considered the #1 public school and a top 20 school, is actually a complete non-target for investment banking and other high finance careers generally outside of LA, and a semi target for jobs even within the LA area. A lot of EB spots in LA are usually taken up by Ivy kids from the SoCal area. Also each grade at UCLA probably consists of 6500 kids, with probably about 2000 business-interested kids? And in total for kids that breaking into IB/S&amp;T/ER, only about 30-35 kids max a year. UCLA does have IB Workshop and Sharpe Fellows as solid programs for sending kids into IB, and each of these programs takes about 20 kids, with about 90% overlap between the two programs. However, the IB workshop is also run by students, compared to workshops at other universities run by faculty, so a lot of the times, the kids being let in to the workshop are just those with friends from the previous years in the clubs.

Don't even get me started on consulting recruiting. UBS' consulting workshop takes a good amount of kids as well, but only like half of them actually manage to break into consulting. For MBB, UCLA sends about 5 a year, and mid-tier (Parthenon, LEK, Accenture, Deloitte) and low-tier consulting (ZS, KPMG, Mercer), they send about 10-15ish. Also, Deloitte Tech Consulting is not consulting at all, so don't be fooled by that.

Also take into account that 90-95% of those kids that get those top jobs were kids in one of the finance/consulting clubs on campus (there's about 3 legit finance clubs and 4 legit consulting ones? and each has like a 3-4% acceptance rate), so even if they somehow didn't get into Workshop or Sharpe, they still have their alum and upperclassmen showing them the ropes and/or pulling strings for them to break into those top jobs. Oh yeah, speaking about alumni, people tend to tell you to network with other alumni at your school. However, UCLA alumni are actually pretty bad - they would usually only help you out if you were in their club or their frat. I just happened to get lucky and get into a club, but the general finance vibe at UCLA is very toxic. Like one of the finance clubs has been starting to get a reputation for being sexist...

It's just so unfortunate that UCLA does so poorly in high finance and consulting recruiting, but it's a great school for accounting (where most of their business-interested kids end up), which is kind of sad considering how highly ranked of a school it is. This might also be attributed to it being such a research-focused school (which is great for STEM majors). But hey, if you're satisfied going to a back office audit job, UCLA might be the perfect place for you. So being realistic, it's actually incredibly hard getting into IB/Consulting/S&amp;T/ER from UCLA.

You're not just competing with other Econ and Biz Econ majors, but kids from other majors as well (like STEM majors that decided that they wanted to do business), and this is just my anecdotal experience, but STEM majors tend to do much stronger in recruiting. Just take a look at any Engineering or Life Science major that recruited for finance or consulting on Linkedin.

If you are strongly considering UCLA, you probably had a good chance at getting into Cal, UMich, UVA, UNC, Notre Dame, Vandy, GTown as well, so if you did, I would strongly advise you to pick one of those schools instead. For example, UVA is ranked below us with double the acceptance rate, but it sends over 100 kids into high finance careers every year. While we send 35 AT MAX.

It sucks a lot, but if you're at UCLA, and even though you might be incredibly capable, if you're unlucky and don't get into ANY of the 7? clubs or Workshop/Sharpe or happen to be a woman/black/hispanic/native american/queer, I honestly think you're kinda screwed. Just a warning."

It's unfortunate that CUB didn't pass, as our campus would significantly benefit from a Black Student Resource center, as well as a Transfer center and other spaces for marginalized communities. It's important to know that many of us Reddit users actually do support the creation of those facilities, and in the future it's likely we'll vote in favor of referendums similar to CUB.

This site's users voted against the referendum for a plethora of reasons. I'm assuming all you've heard is that we're racist and hate all minorities, since that's the only discussion about this site I've seen on Twitter. And I will admit, there are some users that did vote against it for genuinely racist reasons. To deny that would be flat-out lying. However, any legitimately racist sentiments here have been called out as such, and discussions spawned from them have overwhelmingly condemned racist beliefs. Racist people make up an tiny minority of people here.

The discussion of CUB on r/UCLA before the election was not positive on either side. Users here accused USAC of corruption and deceptive language within the referendum, as well as plenty bias in their publications that claimed to have none. I won't say whether or not these accusations were valid. But of the pro-USAC members here, the vast majority of the comments in response to these accusations failed to address them and instead focused on attacking the characters of students who made statements critical of USAC. Funnily enough, I've seen proper answers in various places to these questions that did renew a bit of my support for USAC, though they were not present when we asked for them.

There have been parallels drawn between this behavior and the Trump administration's. In my personal opinion (don't take this as absolute truth), attacking people's character instead of answering questions does seem like what's been going on in Washington DC these past few years.

In any case, know that there are many reasons people here had to vote against CUB, and an extremely small number of ""no"" votes were actually motivated by racism.

It's very easy to make a new account and post ""You're all racist,"" as plenty have done recently. But in that case, all you're doing is further dividing the student body. Please consider that this forum is also made up of (mostly) current Bruins, the same people you're on campus with all year. We do feel hurt when we're attacked for exercising our voting rights, especially when any attempt at defense on Twitter is shut down by ""you're racist"".

If you're new and you'd like to engage in reasonable discourse here, welcome! Remember to follow the sidebar rules, most importantly 1: Treat other users with respect and civility.

Here's to a good year with Naomi heading USAC. I think she can do a lot of good for the school, especially if we can refrain from tearing into each other on the internet."

Can these people not understand the insane amount of stress that students have to go through because of the current conditions? I, personally, have come down with COVID-19 and am forced to isolate myself in my bedroom for weeks, possibly even a month. This is particularly important in my case since my mother is immunocompromised while on chemotherapy and is at a higher risk now more than ever of dying. What’s more, added to the amount of time taken out of my day just because of the extreme precautions I need to take to isolate myself, I have to deal with the crippling fear of the impending moment that my mother dies just because of me.

Given that students like me have to face such harsh conditions, I cannot fathom how the professors for this class could give us quizzes that take twice to three times as long as a normal quiz in a normal math class, not even mentioning how much more difficult the quizzes are than the in-person math classes I have taken.

Additionally, it puts a bad taste in my mouth that the professors waited until the very last moment to give an extension for the insanely difficult second homework assignment. The extension did nothing to help those of us who sacrificed the time we could have dedicated to other classes, homework assignments, and examinations to finish the assignment before the due date. And trust me, many students gave up their studies in all other classes that week just to finish that homework assignment.

People like me exist. We are struggling and losing our minds when professors should be taking more steps to make sure that we don’t do just that. Benefit of the doubt, professors. Benefit of the doubt."

He also made it so that we can't go back and forth. Once you answer a question, you can't go back to it. This obviously messes with time management since you end up having to spend time on difficult questions and you can't leave them for later. 
He gave us a practise T/F midterm from last quarter and it was literally so different. This one didn't test my understanding for the most part and asked for random details. I felt so angry and now I'm sad. 

 He justified making it harder by saying it's open book. And I'm not even a lazy student. I honestly new the concepts well and had detailed notes. I've taken LS midterms and Chem midterms that were more fair than this. 

I'm so done with professors that are making classes harder. This is going to mess with my GPA and more importantly, it's messing with my mental health. I have crying spells and feel demotivated and randomly feel so angry.

# TL:DR; Bias Lighting (Putting lights behind monitor)

Putting lights behind your monitor gives contrast and variety in lighting, which helps your eyes re-adjust for different light sources, thus reducing eye fatigue.

This is probably the first you guys should do. Its a waste of power but I have these on whenever I'm on the computer, but it helps a lot. Working on this post also gives me the ability to flex my setup, but here's what my desk looks like:

The lamps I own are from ikea, but anything works, I  just prefer the defused light look behind my monitor as opposed to direct lighting.

Also, getting an external monitor for your laptop so your neck isnt strained / you dont have to glance all the time to see whats on your screen is also a nice fix. Monitors are like a 100 bucks on amazon, I would recommend since distance learning is going to be a while."

My name is Emily Luong and I was just elected as your Internal Vice President for the year! I just wanted to take the time to introduce myself and open myself up to folks that I haven’t been in touch with before. Please bear with me, I’m very new to Reddit and am working a couple jobs on top of this position and school, but I’ll try to be as active as I can on here! 

A little about me: I’m a third-year Communication major with History and Labor Studies minors. I’m Vietnamese and was born and raised in San Jose, California. My mom is a public school teacher and my dad works with car parts, so I grew up understanding the value of hard work, but also knowing exactly what injustice and inequity looks like - which is a driving force for my interest in political advocacy, labor justice, and community empowerment. On a lighter note, I used to be a freelance makeup artist. I love yarn crafts like knitting/crocheting too, and used to spend hours on projects. Now, my free time is usually spent watching episodes of New Girl, B99, or Elite here and there. 

Some of my goals for the office: protecting student workers’ rights through Know Your Rights workshops and training materials, easing the rent burden through rent-subsidization grants, equipping students and organizations with the funding, access, and knowledge to advocate for their needs, and enacting principles of transformative justice at UCLA. If you’re interested in any of these projects, apps for my office are open and we’d love to have you! 

I know these next few weeks/months are really uncertain and incredibly stressful, and I hope to extend my reach and support for all students at this time. Thanks for hearing me out!"

He recently had a devastating tragedy occur to him (suicide of his uncle) and asked for extensions on class assignments.  He already has anxiety and depression, so the death just devastated him. Even with the extension he needed an extra week, but when he attempted to submit the essay one of his professor’s asserted that for the sake of “grading equity” they had to reduce the final score by an entire letter grade— the assignment was 25% of his grade I believe. I’m not sure what to make of this or if this is fair, but he’s been having an extremely hard time with himself and to think that a prof would do that to him in the midst of a personal crisis and the COVID disaster is kind of messed up.  He’s sad about it but I’m really upset FOR him because I know he cares so much about his GPA. I doubt any students in that class would object to a teacher giving him an extra week (on top of the one he already got) for the sake of “grading equity.” Am I overreacting or should he just leave it alone? He’s trying to talk to them about it, but I’m not sure how any of that is going. Any thoughts are appreciated, just not sure if he’s being unfairly graded. Nothing seems equal in this situation when he’s been at a disposition the whole quarter."

My route here is probably unlike most of you. I was a terrible student in high school, I graduated w/ a 2.2 gpa and I never even took the SAT cuz I had 0 college prospects. No one really thought I was going to be anything, and the thought of college was such a distant idea to me, let alone a prestigious school like UCLA. 

So looking back, I really can't believe I'm here. I'm so thankful for America giving me a 2nd chance, cuz in my home country you only get one shot to succeed... there is no such thing as community college, and you take one test in high school that determines the entire course of your future. 

While this year certainly had bumps on the road w/ unfortunate cancellations, I am nevertheless thankful for the people I've met and the lessons I've learned. It still feel so surreal to me, to say that I'm a UCLA grad. I really went from 2.2 in high school to magna cum laude at UCLA, like it still feels like a dream

Congrats to other class of 2020 members, really looking forward to see everyone continue to kill it in the future. And if you're still here next fall, please take what happened this year as a lesson and make the best of what you have! If I have one regret it's that I kept saying ""I have one more quarter"" to hold off on being as social as I wanted to be."

I was granted 
    permission by one of the moderators to post this here. It is urgent; 
    please read if you have the time to.

**The gist of it**  is that the UC Davis bookstore is implementing a new predatory program  that will financially harm unsuspecting students. Every quarter,  starting Fall 2020, they will charge all opted-in students $199 as a  bulk fee for all materials that they may or may not even need. However,  they opt in \*all\* UC Davis students automatically, and we have a window  of less than a month to opt out. Furthermore, the last day to opt out is  September 10th--almost three weeks before the first day of Fall 2020  instruction, on September 30th.

**Why is this a problem?**  Because most students at UC Davis won't know about it until they're  billed at the beginning of the quarter, when it's too late for them to  opt out and they will be unable to dispute it. There are also several  other problems with it, detailed on the petition page, which I will  mention in a minute.

**How does this affect you?** If this cash-grab is successful, other UCs will likely follow suit--including UCLA.

Yes, there is a petition where you can stop this. [Petition to stop ""Equitable Access""](http://chng.it/GMw9gwgL86)

So there’s this boy that I kept seeing at De Neve during quarantine, but me being the pussy that I am never had the balls to ask for his number (or his name for that matter). The first time I saw him, he actually spoke to me (he just talked about how he got moved from saxon to hedrick when quarantine started), but maybe he was just being friendly cause after that we never talked. I swiped eagerly hoping he’d randomly show up on my tinder, but alas he never did. He’s tall with dark brown curly hair and what I think were green eyes (possibly jewish?). From the way he walks, I don’t even think he really knows just how cute he is but daaamn he’s fine. Well anyway recently I started seeing him at de neve with a girl, so he’s probably not even available (i wouldn’t be surprised). But, in the event that she’s actually his sister and he is single, I thought I’d try and shoot my shot. Besides I leave tomorrow anyway and will probably never see him again, so what do I have to lose? If anyone knows who I’m talking about, pls help a girl out lol.

With it looking all but certain that at least some coursework will continue online into the fall quarter, what do you think faculty and TAs can do to improve the quality of the experience?

Not looking to put any instructors on blast, but if there was anything you found that either really worked, or REALLY didn't, I'd love to hear your thoughts and suggestions.

For context, I'm TAing a course this fall, and would really like to make the experience as positive as possible in the event that it has to be online.

EDIT: So a few things that are pretty consistent so far for a good experience: Having materials well in advance, and recording lectures and making them available. Also having a clear calendar and sticking with it. Also not overwhelming the class with assignments, or scaling up difficulty to overly compensate for cheating. Some specific things I'm trying to gage:

* **Policy on mandatory cameras on during session:** Obtrusive or helpful?
* **Breakout sessions:** Helpful and community building, or awkward and forced?
* **Online forums:** Piazza, CCLE, (anyone use Discord?), were these helpful or distracting?
* **Cheating:** Any decent solutions out there for ensuring academic integrity that aren't awful to students?
* **Office Hours:** How did TAs handle them remotely, and how were they?

Please do not refer to Andre as ""’Scuse me boss, can I ask you a question guy."" This is not the proper way to refer to UCLA's original and flagship questioner. Andre is the only proper and acceptable way to say it. ‘Scuse me boss, can I ask you a question guy, on the other hand, is not.

As the system's most prestigious and respected boss, he feels that it is important to honor and maintain an appropriate level of respect for our hero’s name. I feel that ""’Scuse me boss, can I ask you a question guy"" cheapens his brand and doesn't emphasize the incredible prestige associated with his asking of questions.

While it may be acceptable to refer to all other campus icons in synecdoches - Husky guy, for example - due to their lack of recognition and prestige, this is not acceptable for the flagship and most well-known icon, and we therefore request that you cease using the name ""’Scuse me boss, can I ask you a question guy"" to refer to Andre.

Why does UCLA football wear the “Powder Keg Blue” home jersey’s? 

Before Red Sanders became the UCLA coach in 1949, the football team wore dark blue (almost navy) football jerseys for home games.  You can find those pictures [here](https://thesouthernbranch.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/kenny-washington-1939-v-tcu-3-16-14-ab.jpg?w=485&amp;h=467&amp;zoom=2) with Jackie Robinson.  When Red started at UCLA he changed the home uniforms to light blue [seen here](https://thesouthernbranch.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/ernie-johnson-versus-usc-1949-game-aaa-aaa.jpg?w=393&amp;h=294) with gold or white numbers.  If you look at the picture you realize that the very light blue with gold or white numbers make it look like all white uniforms in black and white photography.  

So here’s the story.  It was told to me by someone who played baseball at UCLA in the 1950s (when the baseball field was where Pauley Pavilion sits right now).  The move to light “Powder Keg Blue” football jerseys wasn’t just to make a differentiation from Cal.  About this time UCLA was distinguishing itself as a separate university, not just the “Southern Branch”.  

Before every football game was on TV, teams would film their games to learn about how they played.  They would also trade film of their home games with future opponents so both teams knew what to expect when they played.  The light blue uniforms looked white on b/w film and gold/white numbers were tough to see.  Well, the visiting team also wears white so if you are looking at film with no graphics and no announcers, it was hard for the person watching the film to tell which team is which.  Additionally the white numbers made it very difficult to tell (on film) which players were on the field at any time.  People at the game could tell the teams apart and read the numbers as could the officials, but the limitations of film at the time made them hard to differentiate.  It wasn’t impossible, but it made it just a little bit harder for the opposing coaches to watch tape and if you know football it is won and lost exploiting the little advantages.

Additionally Red Sanders instructed the athletics staff to wash the jerseys over and over again in hot water so that they got lighter as the season went on."

I came into UCLA as a chemistry major, blissfully unaware of how unprepared I was for the introductory level classes. When I got to Chem 20A, it was all dandy for the first midterm, but when we got to the second midterm I was so lost I started crying during the exam. This happened for the final, and it got even worse during Chem 20B. Math 31A and 31B were no different. I was totally unprepared for the level of difficulty, and was absolutely /blindsided/ by the amount of work I had to put into these classes. I could go on about my numerous mental breakdowns that I had during these classes, and how I actually broke down in tears in front of my professor like an absolute clown, but y’all probably don’t want to relive your own trauma so I’ll spare the details. 

Long story short, those classes absolutely decimated me and my GPA. I managed to scrape by with a C-, two C’s, and a C+ in the math 31 series and the Chem 20 series. I wisened up and switched my major to Classic Civ which had been my one beacon of happiness through those two quarters. Since first quarter, I’ve had all A’s in my humanities classes. 

I know it is silly to be worrying about this now, but my degree is now pretty niche. I’m so terrified that admissions committees for grad school (I really want to go to UCLA’s Cotsen Institute too) are going to see my shitty math and chemistry grades and will write me off. I don’t know if it’s the YouTube videos I’ve been watching, or the grad students I’ve talked to, but they all had B+-A’s their entire college career. Needless to say, I am scared shitless that my blunder will haunt me for the rest of my academic life, at least till I get to grad school. 

If any of y’all have advice or can explain how important grades might be, I’d be really thankful 🥺 

TL;DR : I fucked up my freshman year and now I’m stuck with some shitty grades, can I recover?"
haae9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/haae9o/some_thoughts_about_affirmative_action/,Some thoughts about Affirmative Action,17,47,2020-06-16 12:05:19,"I shared this on UCLA Secrets but I thought you guys might appreciate it.

&amp;#x200B;

With the possibility of a repeal of Proposition 209, I thought it  would be a good opportunity to share my feelings about taking race into  consideration for college admissions.

I am Hispanic. I went to  public school in an inland region of the state where over 80 percent of  all students were Hispanic/Latinx I didn't have formal SAT prep or  college essay guidance in school. Yet despite this, I had significant  privilege over my peers at home and many of my fellow Bruins: both of my parents graduated college.

As early I can remember, attending  college to study STEM was an expectation. My mom walking me around her  old campus when I was young, my dad telling me stories of his dorm days,  and my parents' constant encouragement (and pressure) all helped give a  level of preparation that my friends did not have the luxury of  enjoying. Most of my friends had to figure out the college process on  their own. And they weren't all Latinx. They were lower-income Black,  White, and Asian students, students with single parents and students  that had to work to support their families.

When admissions  decisions were released, I was blessed with the choice between several  UCs, some small selective private schools, and my dream Ivy league  campus. When visiting the private campuses (which explicitly mentioned  ""diversity"" when reaching out to me), I couldn't help but feel an odd  sense of imposter syndrome, especially when I thought of my  less-privileged but equally-qualified peers at home who had been  rejected.

I chose to go to UCLA because it was by far the most  affordable, but also in part because I've always admired the mission of  the UC system. Driven minds from all over the state (and world!) are  brought together without consideration of their racial background. In a  time when some elite private schools are accused of explicitly  discriminating against Asian-Americans, I've always felt that the UC's  rejection of Affirmative Action is a bit of justice for my  Asian-American friends.

It's true that Black/Latinx/Indigenous  population is severely underrepresented in UCLA's south campus. I don't  think anything could really have prepared me for the culture shock of  being a part of such a small minority. But here at UCLA, I've found  amazing support and community from both University programs and from my  new friends. To me, UCLA seemed to have the perfect balance of equality  and equity.

When I first heard the news of the possibility of a  Prop 209. repeal, my immediate reaction was concern. It upset me to  imagine many of my wonderfully kind and intelligent friends rejected on  the basis of race. But then I think about my parents. They both attended  UC schools before Prop 209. My parents may have been offered admission  because Affirmative Action! Had they never gotten the educational (and  subsequent job) opportunities that they did, I might have never had the  resources that led me here. Was my academic effort in high school  insignificant compared to the immense privilege I inherited from my  educated parents?

I do not claim to have any solution to the  deeply-rooted inequality we face in our nation. What I do know is that  we must not be afraid to discuss these real challenges that affect all  of us, every day. It is our responsibility to build a more just world  for tomorrow"

I just finished the MIMG curriculum and I’m simping, since I’m going to miss it. So here’s a post about everything MIMG, with some general advice too.*

*Tl;dr: Learn. Grind. Be kind. Do practice exams. Get laid, if you want. Call your mom.*

Maybe you made it through AP bio, AP chem, and AP physics with flying colors. Or maybe high school academics were a little harder for you. Either way, **college is a fresh start to get your shit together and be better than yesterday.**

**General College Advice**

You will be able to kick ass if you put in the effort. I was one of those people who coasted in high school. College is a different beast and, to be successful, effort matters. **It’s not about “innate” intelligence. Fuck that shit.** 

Grind. Do your best. Put in your max effort. If you do all that you can, a B- can feel like you’ve summited Everest. If you’re knowingly lazy, even an A- should feel like a slap in the face. So do your best. Be the best version of yourself.

Some people will have had access to tutors all their life and be at an advantage; that’s fine for them, but we live in the information age and there are resources to help you out no matter what. AAP is a great program for tutoring if you qualify. There are people who want you to succeed, no matter what academic background you have. Ask older peers for their tips and tricks in the classes you’re taking. They might have old tests too. Stay motivated by hanging around like-minded peers!

The point I want to stress is that things should be difficult. Make them difficult for yourself. Do one more practice test than everyone else. Go to the fucking test bank and practice, practice practice! Get something long-term out of your classes.

Learning is what we’re here for. I hate the premed culture of getting A’s and moving on. I’ve been in an immunology lab for almost 3 years and we’ve discussed everything from algorithms to pi-stacking. Every course you take has value in it. Go to office hours. Genuinely be interested. Don’t BS stuff, try to understand concepts and really absorb them. Learn.

**First Two Years**

First and foremost, let’s talk about prereqs. These are the classes that you need to take to even declare the major. 

*CHEM 14A and B - CHEMISTRY 1, AKA WHY ARE YOU MAKING PREMEDS LEARN THERMODYNAMICS GENE BLOCK*

People call these weeder classes, but don’t be intimidated. What you need to do is find old tests. Ask friends, older life science majors, and anyone you can find. I took these with Laurence Lavelle and he was very kind and cute, but the exams were tricky. Make sure you do all the homework; Lavelle loves putting homework problems on the exams. He also loves reusing exam questions. 

I don’t know if Lyndon Bui is still around, but he was an undergraduate assistant to Lavelle and his worksheets were fantastic. Make sure you go to review sessions and do all of the worksheets! They will help immensely. For classes where discussions are optional, search/hunt for the best TA, they can be super clutch and give insight into exams.

Work smart and work hard.

Common criticisms:

1. This class groups people who have taken AP Chemistry with people who haven’t. That is a large gap. If you are not confident in your chemistry abilities, you can always take Chem 17 first! That class eases you into both the conceptual and the math-y side of chemistry. 
2. Why the fuck am I learning thermodynamics if I’m a pre-med/pre-PhD in bio/pre-industry? Because fuck you, that’s why. Just kidding, I genuinely think that the chemistry you learn in these classes is useful. I use stoichiometry in my lab all the time. Thermo comes up in some of the more chemistry-based papers I read. So, I think it is good baseline knowledge. At a certain point, this is a philosophical question. Why do we learn things we may not use? Because, indeed, we just \*may\* use them. Thermo is difficult, but I think it is possibly applicable in plenty of research.

*CHEM 14C and D - CHEMISTRY 2, ELECTRIC BOOGALOO (Organic Chemistry)*

General note: OChem at UCLA is very manageable. I think like 20% of people get As. It is possible to do well. Push yourself, study often, go to office hours, and push yourself some more.

14C was all about molecular structures. So you end up learning about chirality and NMR and IR. If you’re a premed, this will come up on the MCAT! I didn’t love this class with all my heart, but I was also going through some shit while I took it. It is valuable and fun, just do all the practice. 

14D was one of my favorite classes at UCLA. You learn about organic chemistry reactions. First and foremost, you have to memorize all the reactions given to you in the class. There’s SN1 and SN2 and E1 and E2 and alkylation and amination and oxygenation and… ad infinitum. I think we learned like 100+ reactions by the end of the quarter. But goddamn is building molecules fun. Synthesis is a puzzle. Memorize and apply. Do problems. Go to OH like your life depends on it.

I promise you, the critical thinking skills you learn in OChem are useful to life. When you realize that OChem is just making molecules make love to each other with their electrons, it becomes a lot easier.

*LS 7A-7C, 23L - BIOLOGY BABYYYYYY*

(Molecular Biology; Ecology and Evolution; Physiology; Life Science Lab)

I will speak about 7A-7C generally, since they are all taught the same way. The professor will sit you down, teach you some things about CRISPR or PCR, and then make you do a clicker question on them. You will do some launchpad assignments, which is just to make sure you’re paying attention and doing reading. When studying, pay attention to the clicker questions and all of the critical thinking. Go to the problem solving sessions. Understand what they are teaching you, question what they teach you, and figure out how they want you to think. Doing well in these classes is about learning how they will test you.

I got a C- on my first 7C midterm. I got lazy. That hurt like a bitch; suddenly, I was worried about even getting a B. Don’t get lazy. Do the clickers, go to office hours, learn how it works for you. And importantly, try to get inside of the test writer’s heads. What are they trying to ask? How does it relate to the clicker questions? What makes sense in terms of the diagram given? 

LS23 is chill. It kinda sucks to be in a lab for 3 hours, but hey, we got to give a goldfish caffeine which I thought was cool. 

Common criticism: 

1) Why do we need to apply the shit we learn? I thought biology was all about memorizing? Fuck. That. Application is the basis of the biomedical sciences and it’s damn beautiful. It’ll also help for the MCAT. I know that the LS core is not always the best to their students and that it seems damn regimented, but application is not the problem there. I guarantee you that the 7 series is better than the old wholly memorization based 1-4 series. If you’re going to grad school, application is important. In fact, it’ll be your job. If you’re going to medical school, you’ll need to think deeply about molecular biology and physiology. We are living in the gorgeous age of molecular medicine, as well. One day, doctors might just have to interpret RNAseq results.

*Physics 5A-C - E=MC\^FUCK* 

(Kinematics; Waves, Oscillations, and Thermodynamics; Electricity and Magnetism)

Physics can be tough for people, especially if you haven’t taken it before or aren’t yet strong in math. Plus, you are being taught physics by people who consider kinematics second nature. This creates a divide, where the profs think d=v0t+1/2at\^2 is easy while students are lost in the dark.

I cannot emphasize the importance of doing problems. Think about things in terms of variables, not in terms of the numbers. Concepts are everything! Learn, learn, learn. Don’t get centripetal force? Watch a Khan academy video on it. Do problems. Undergrad physics is objective. Get the right answers in your problems, understand how an answer would change if one variable (mass, velocity, acceleration, etc) changes. Get an intuitive understanding.

The labs for these classes are chill, don’t worry about it. The TAs will help you quite a bit.

*Math 3C, Stats 13, PIC10A - NUMBERS R HARD* 

(Differential Equations/Linear Algebra, Statistics, and Intro to C++)

Most of y’all are probably gonna take the Math 31/32 series or the LS30 series. Sorry. 

3C - I took this class with Jukka, who was a homie. Honestly, his OH basically told me what was on the exams. This was 3 years ago, so I don’t remember much else about the quizzes and exams though. Do the homework and shit, I guess.

13 - Chill, but so important. One of my pet peeves is the lack of statistics knowledge in bio majors. Shit, this is how you interpret whether a scientific result is valid or not! Pay attention to the niceties of p-values, the problems with them, and learn about resampling (a very cool method for analysis of non-normal data). 

PIC10A - I was going well in this class and I loved learning how to code! It’s very logical, once you get the syntax out of the way. I would suggest PIC10A to everyone! Coding is integral to research and to being able to do some cool ass shit in your free time. I got lazy in this class and got a 70 on the final. Don’t be a Jay. Be better. 

*CHEM 14BL, 14CL - DAD MY PIPETTE BROKE*

(Chem lab 1, Chem lab 2)

To be honest, I didn’t love 14BL. Lots of busywork in lab reports and the like. The concepts align with the 14 series, though, so taking BL around the time of 14C isn’t a bad idea. I took it in the summer after 14C and it was fine for me (and only 6 weeks!). I’m taking 14CL in the fall as part of my last quarter. 

**Upper Divs** 

This is the yummy shit. MIMG has some of the best professors on campus. Peter Bradley, Steve Bensinger, Zoran Galic, Lili Yang, Melody Li, Oliver Fregoso, Asim Dasgupta, and others have all been fantastic. Get ready for a wonderful challenge, full of science, critical thinking, and getting your ass whooped with knowledge. Again, you will do well if you work your ass off! 

*MIMG 101 - INTRO TO VIRUSES AND PATHOGENS AND LITERAL SHIT*

(Introductory Microbiology)

*Note: Take this class before 102. It’ll set you up well for that class because 101 has some virology content; 102 is tougher and has more problem solving.*

I would suggest taking this with Dr. Bradley. He is a kind, hilarious soul who loves parasites. He usually co-teaches with someone. The final is non-cumulative with him, by the way. 

You’ll learn about fermentation, bacterial pathogenesis, viruses, operons, and some cool molecular biology. There is lots of memorization involved, yes. But you will also have to apply what you’ve memorized in exams. This course was not easy, but definitely showed me how to synthesize large amounts of biological information into what’s relevant. I’m astounded by the diversity of microbes. They can respire fucking anything. They’re metal as fuck and will be alive long after we nuclear war/climate change/uncontrolled AI ourselves to death. 

*CHEM 153A HOLY SHIT HEMOGLOBIN IS COOL BUT FUCK PYMOL*

(Biochemistry 1)

Title. Just kidding.

Advice: Do lots of practice and try and find people who have old tests. Do all of the study questions and LISTEN TO WORDING. The LAs and TAs are very helpful. Every premed takes this class, so really enlist the help of your elders. Get some old tests!!! Note: this class is WAY harder than MCAT biochem, just make sure you come away with knowing amino acids and their properties.

If I’m honest, I loved the content of this class but abhorred the teaching. Who the fuck cares about wording? Problem solving is so much more fun, man. 

*MIMG 102 MORE VIRUSES AND SOME LIFE ADVICE*

(Introductory Virology)

Let’s get this straight first, Dasgupta is a guru. He’ll give you great life advice. Very kind, gentle soul. Funny and knowledgeable. He teaches you about phages and polio. Some of his style is a bit outdated, though, which is where the new profs (Melody Li and Oliver Fregoso) come in. 

With them, you’ll learn about some major viral families, from Alphaviridae to Zetaviridae. We were talking about coronaviridae in our class when the pandemic hit, which was kind of meta. 

The two newer profs are fantastic. They updated the material and discussed important epidemiological factors and biological components of viruses. I learned a lot, truly. I didn’t know how crazy diverse viruses were before this. 

*MIMG 158 16S rRNA IS LYFE* 

(Microbial Genetics)

This class was basically a review of like \~20 papers. You go over experimental methods, write some responses, and that’s about it. Exams are pretty simple, just know the papers’ methods and conclusions and you’ll be fine. I took it in the summer after sophomore year.

*MIMG 185A CD4 CD8 WHO DO WE APPRECIATE* 

(Immunology)

HOLY SHITSNACKS. This was my favorite class at UCLA, probably by a mile. Zoran Galic is the sweetest academic you will ever find. Every office hours, he’d buy us oranges and make jokes before starting questions. He even remembered my name after the quarter ended and chatted with me for 30 minutes about life. So awesome.

The content is tricky, but so amazing. We have a whole molecular, cellular network that exists inside of us. Antagonistic cytokine pathways (Th1 vs Th2), innate immunity making sure we don’t die from cuts, and adaptive immunity being able to recognize almost any non-self molecular pattern? Holy fuck. What a gorgeous, interesting world we live in. 

The exams will kick your ass. They are open-note, but be forewarned that you better study like they aren’t. They curve heavily; the averages are in the 50s or 60s usually.

This class is the epitome of good teaching. It is all problem based and really is the quintessential MIMG course.

*MIMG 185B FUCK, IMMUNOLOGY IS COOL AKA I WANT TO GO TO GRAD SCHOOL*

(Advanced Immunology) 

This was a seminar where you present a paper and take a final (for us, it was about SARS-CoV-2 and the immune response). Prof. Cheng is very knowledgeable about immunology and gave a 45 minute lecture every class. I learned a lot, but it was not as involved as 185A. I mean, it is a 2 unit class. Fun extra class if you’re into immuno!

*MIMG 132 RNA IS COOL AS FUCK (and some other things)* 

(Nuclear Cell Biology) 

This class gets a bad rap. Granted, I took it this quarter with the COVID pandemics so it was open note and all. The professors definitely care about you learning. Dr. Black is research and critical thinking focused, which I appreciated dearly. Dr. Berk is older and cares more about memorization. The exams were difficult, but not impossible. Listen to Dr. Black’s lectures and memorize all of Dr. Berk’s assigned readings. 

The class was tedious, but I can’t say I had as detailed an understanding of protein structure, transcriptional regulation, translational regulation, genome organization, and cell cycle before this class.

I think during regular quarters, you get a list of 60 study questions and those end up on the midterm and final. Not as fun as how I took it.

*Path 1 vs Path 2:* 

In Path 1, you do research as a part of a class. You learn about either phages or bacteria, I believe. There’s bioinformatics analysis and wet lab stuff. I’ve heard it can be tedious, but cool if you have a good group. I think you actually end up publishing your findings in some journal. Pretty dope! 

In Path 2, you do advanced independent research. You work in a lab and you apply for path 2. If you get it, you take MIMG 180A/B and 196A/B or 198A/B/C (198 if you want to do department honors where you write a thesis). 180A/B are cool classes about scientific communication. Path 2 is pretty great, tbh. You get class credit for research and it helps your progress to your major by quite a bit.

*MIMG 180A, 180B LET’S TALK ABOUT RESEARCH* 

(Scientific Analysis and Communication)

Awesome classes where you present your research and get critiqued by your professors. They are foremost MIMG researchers at UCLA. It is an awesome experience, and I still talk to one of my professors from this class. They give great advice about graduate school and are so genuine. Shit like this makes me love MIMG.

*MIMG 191H* 

(Bioethics; Departmental Honors Seminar)

You have to take this class for departmental honors; it is taught by the dep’t honors advisor, Jeffrey H Miller. He’s a character, he spent 10 minutes every class playing with the lights. He can be a tiny bit grumpy and he interrupts presentations out of nowhere. He means well, I think? It kind of became a meme with me and my friends. LOL.

Each student presents on 2 bioethics topics of their choosing for about an hour each, and that’s it. No final, no paper. You’ll be writing your thesis concurrently. 

*MIMG 199, 198, 196*

199 is research for credit. You can use this for MIMG elective credit if you work for a lab.

198 is department honors research; it’s 199 but while you are pursuing an undergraduate thesis. You apply for this either during path 2 or before senior year. 

196 is the path 2 research class if you don’t do department honors. 

All in all, MIMG has treated me very well. It is a tough major, but one that emphasizes critical thinking and prepares you really well for graduate school, medical school, and industry. By no means is it perfect; I think the department could do better in terms of recruiting diverse students and faculty. However, it is a very welcoming, challenging, and rewarding major.

**Personal Remarks and Closing Notes** 

Shit got really tough for me in my freshman year. I was going through a pretty catastrophic breakup, I missed my family, my uncle passed away and my grandma had a stroke. 

Life is tough enough. So don’t be hard on yourself. By all means, do your best. Work your hardest. Obsess over what you want to obsess over (for me, it was research). But at the end of it all, **be kind to yourself and to others**. 

Enjoy time with friends, read, party, do whatever you want in your free time. I love going out to ice cream shops and new restaurants. I love literature. Be multifaceted. We only have one life, and we deserve to give every facet of it our best shot. Plan school around life, not the other way around. You're a human first.

In the words of Mark Twain, “Don’t let school get in the way of your education.”

Success isn’t about a GPA, a graduate school, or a snazzy Linkedin. It’s about personal contentment. If you can go to sleep at night knowing internally that you are happy with yourself, you’ve won. I struggle with that sometimes, but it’s a process. If you do all that you can, you should be proud of yourself. I’ll be proud of you too.

I’m applying for MD-PhD programs next year, so please go ahead and message me if you need advice about either pathway. I’m lucky to have a good GPA, great research experience, good clinical experience, and I volunteer a lot too so I’ll help mentor how I can.

Now that I’ve done this post, if any senior in other majors want to make something similar, please do! We’re in tough times; the least we can do is help out the UCLA community we’re leaving.

hu77qf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/hu77qf/my_toxic_and_awful_tsp_experience_inspired_by_the/,My (Toxic and Awful) TSP Experience - Inspired by the Other Post,98,88,2020-07-19 13:11:47,"I read the other TSP post after a friend sent it to me today over messenger. My experience at UCLA was very impacted by TSP and I think almost every problem I had was because of the severe anxiety TSP instilled in me about white people and not being accepted. By the way this is probably not as organized as the other post - these are difficult memories for me to look back on and a lot of stuff I tried to block.

A lot of what the other poster said was accurate even though I am certain we were in different cohorts. I’m mixed hispanic and  white and there were Many incidents in my cohort not aimed at me that gave me a lot of anxiety about how I should and could express myself. There was one guy in the African American History cohort who was in front of the class berated for appropriating Black culture for having braids despite being a Mixed Black guy. Incidents like this were extremely common. I always felt anxious about how to express myself and coming off a certain way because of it. At one point I became really sick in the quarter and I was in a study group speaking slowly because it was late and I was sick and this guy yelled at me. After several more similar incidents, I was scared to defend myself or go to the professor because I thought people might complain that I was being an obnoxious white girl (or a “Karen” even though That phrase didn’t even exist then!). I didn’t even say anything when I became very drunk at a dorm party (someone later told me that my drinks were being spiked with mostly rum when I wasn’t looking even though I asked for only a small amount of alcohol and mostly soda). and the sober friend I went to for help took advantage of me sexually. I didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to be the “white girl accusing brown guys of assault” And I tried to convince myself nothing bad happened. even though I don’t regret not reporting him I do wish I had at least accepted what happened And seen a therapist at CAPS.

The professors at TSP would constantly tell us that UCLA was a majority white school (its not but if you try to say that people will get mad at you) and that it was not made for us and that we would be constantly discriminated against. It made everyone mistrusting of white people but also put this idea in many people’s minds that white people are ALL extremely privileged and have bad intentions against non-white people (Well Asians were almost never spoken about and there were about 4 Asian people in my cohort so who knows. at one point I figured they thought Asian people were white). It’s also very confusing if you are mixed with white but the nuanced experiences of mixed people or even privileged POC ( i knew multiple girls who felt super insecure being non-white and not experiencing poverty and said they felt like they had to pretend to be not be decently well off to be accepted) are just not taught there and no one feels safe talking about them.

This was a large reason for my anxiety my first year at UCLA. TSP is shaped by Identity Politics. I felt constant anxiety and extremely helpless. I saw myself as a victim all the time even though this was a very unhealthy mindset. We were taught white people were all very rich and out to get us.

If TSP wanted students of color and students from low-income or disadvantaged backgrounds to thrive they should’ve been teaching us about financial literacy and budgeting/saving (Something many of my TSP friends and I struggled with a lot during our few years at UCLA), different resources available at UCLA separate from AAP (like The career center, scholarship center), balancing taking care of our physical and mental health with school, etc. But I was not taught these things: I was taught that evil white forces at UCLA were out to get me and many of us went into our first year at UCLA unable to deal with challenging opinions/ideas (if someone is challenging us they must be attacking us), unable to deal with adversity (a lot of my friends And I who dealt w normal challenges of being at a hard school assumed everything hard that happened to us was bc we weren’t white - sometimes math is just hard bro its not because you are not white), and unable to navigate being at a very large school or take care of our physical/mental health. But I really don’t think TSP wanted that. I think TSP just wanted us to believe strongly in their Identity Politics and hate every white person or person we perceived to be privileged that we came across without getting to know them.

Some other weird things from TSP:

\- A girl with some sort of disability and anxiety being constantly harassed for acting awkwardly.

\- ”Jewish people don’t experience discrimination” and the professor being totally chill with that statement.

\- Someone accusing their white roommate of saying something racist in the TSP group chat during fall quarter and then completely changing their story when people say they are going to confront her roommate about it. 

\- No one being allowed to say anything different or challenging (students are way too scared to - I didn’t even know there were people in my cohort who felt like me at the time or anyone who thought it was all bullshit until years later because that’s how unsafe we feel speaking up Or invalidated we felt by our experiences.)

\- San Juan trashing a girl who disagreed with her privately before class on something in front of the whole class and claiming she wouldn’t come back to teach because of her (Guess she came back anyways, so not sure what the point of that was). 

Anyways, this is my subjective experience. here’s more to it but I already feel like i wrote a whole novella. i will say I made some life long close friends at TSP and I can not imagine my life without them. I also was exposed to a way of thinking/viewing that world that even though I do not accept as my own viewpoint anymore has played a huge role in me coming to the current opinions/politics I have now And made me a stronger thinker once I was willing to shed what I was taught. One of my more relaxed professors was also very supportive and has helped many of us out which I am grateful for. If you have any questions I’ll try to answer as honestly as possible but remember this is my Subjective experience and not every single person’s experience at TSP. I am sharing it because I think its important and not talked about it enough though. Sorry for any grammar errors!"

Cons of dating me: I require batteries. I am a bit of an older model so I’m not as flashy or as fancy as the newer models, but I make up for it in experience! 

Math and physics majors preferred but I am flexible. Just worried about how much attention I’m going to get otherwise. Serious offers only please. PM me if interested."

I'm curious to see what some of them are. They don't necessarily need to be conservative but rather things that would go against the majority view at UCLA.
htxo4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/htxo4v/to_those_interested_or_attending_the_transfer/,To those interested or attending the Transfer Summer Program,37,49,2020-07-19 02:12:42,"Hey all, I'm a rising senior who participated in TSP last year. I've been thinking about writing a little letter about my experience in TSP for a while, and seeing multiple people ask about it recently, I've decided to do it. The program was very enlightening, but very dramatic and honestly quite gross at times. **Your individual experience may vary drastically based on your race**, so I'll divide it into objective and subjective sections. The objective section is the simple, cut and dry description, **the subjective section is where you'll want to pay the most attention.**

Objectively: This program is meant for underrepresented groups. Minorities, BIPOC, POC, called it however you like, but there is a defined target population that operates to have the program entirely for folks from low-income or other disadvantaged household types (ex: foster care). In reality, 90% of people were black or brown, a lot of them locals of LA (Hawthorne, Inglewood, etc.). Whether or not you are in this target pop. is defined by your FAFSA application. If you do not meet their requirements, you will not even see the application portal unless you call the AAP directly (which is what I did).

Everyone in the program takes 4 classes: **English Comp, Research Seminar, PLF Session** (basically tutoring), and **an elective which stems from whichever cohort you are placed in**. I was in the Psych cohort, so I along with everyone else in my cohort took Community Psychology. You can select a preference for a cohort somewhere on the TSP application.

**The Psych Cohort** was notoriously more difficult than the other cohorts. Students in other cohorts, such as Afro-American Studies, and Chicano studies, had an objectively easier time, with the vast majority of them earning 4.0's. This is where you may have heard of TSP being a GPA booster. This is quite simply not true for the Psych cohort, where the grade distribution was posted and only 9 out ~35 students received A's. Community Psychology itself was a great class, as someone who has an AA in Psych, it was a nice dab of upper division Psych.

**The Research Seminar** class is where things got weird. Taught by Dr. San Juan, this class is supposed to focus on the roadmap of research within UCLA. However, it was more just listening to a lady yell weird shit. San Juan would routinely say, ""You [directed towards the 99% POC crowd] don't belong here. UCLA wasn't built for minorities. They don't want you here. They see you and think that you don't deserve it. You need to prove them wrong. And you'll be given a minority pass. I'm sure you have already been given some"". This may sound jarring and you may be tempted to not believe me, but Dr. San Juan said these things, almost verbatim (I'm writing from memory).

**The Subjective Experience**
Earlier, I stated that your experience may vary based on your race. It will also vary largely on how able you are to endure heavy conversations in which you **will** feel attacked at times, whether in regards to your race, identity, culture, ethnicity, basically any personal trait is up for debate at this program, especially if you are white. Due to this, it is only right that I describe my race and ethnicity, as my experience in TSP was definitely shaped by this. I'm Taiwanese-Irish (dad 100% irish, mom 100% taiwanese), first generation immigrant. My mom got her master's here, but my sister and I are the first to get undergrad here. We have no family here besides cousins that I rarely see. With a diverse ethnicity, and cultures that are pretty split up, I've always had multiple friend groups spread across races: white friend groups, asian friend groups, and diverse ones. So heading into this program, I felt like I had a handle on my identity, and was pretty ready to speak comfortably in front of other people who also held their identity close to their soul (ie sensitive to anyone who could even potentially discredit their experience).

Boy was I wrong. And not even because I wasn't confident in who I am as a person. But because when you have 90% of the students in the program coming from deeply cultured, low-SES, disadvantaged areas and families, in a 6 week think-tank together, there will be pent-up anger against ""the system"" that will be taken out on the ""privileged"" 10% individuals who have benefitted from the same system that hurt the 90%. Of course, the 10% is people who look white enough. (super liberal north campus shit incoming, sorry no sorry but identity politics is just like this)

Some examples: I was in a study lounge of about 12 people when the majority of them began berating a white-passing girl (mexican ethnicity, looks white enough to pass as white) for having a yoga-pass. The majority of people were shouting across the room, laughing at this girl for being able to afford both a yoga-pass, and the Wooden Center fee's. This may seem light, but this was literally racism, and it was over half the room yelling, incredibly animated, at this one girl. They were discrediting and berating a girl for being able to afford something based upon the color of her ski; ""of course you have a yoga-pass, none of *us* could ever afford that. only white people can"". That girl ended up leaving the room quickly, and I later comforted her as she cried. Part of the reason I disliked this program is because it gave the 90% a feeling of validation when they grouped up on these unsuspecting individuals. 

More stories of weirdly accepted things: Remember that weird lady San Juan? She required students to attend office hours for her seminar assignments. When I arrived at her office, her first words to me were, ""You don't belong in this program. Why did they let you in?"" I don't give a single fuck what color skin I am, if I'm black or green, or yellow. I'm a new fucking transfer to a top public uni where imposter syndrome runs rampant. This fucked up my confidence so badly for a hot second. Of course, San Juan was really referring to how I entered a program meant for low-SES ppl. However, this really put the cap on how I felt weird for being in this minority space. Almost like they didn't want me. San Juan said similar things to the few white people who also joined the program.

It's 2am. I need sleep. But overall, TSP was very enlightening because I got to hear the experience of Dreamers, foster care, low-SES students. I met some amazing people who I hope to always talk to. But simultaneously, I was 100% attacked based on my race and SES status myself. My mental health was definitely adversely affected. The golden question, ""Would I do it again""... yes. And it's because I had incredibly positive, enlightening experiences. But I truly would not recommend this program for everyone. If you cannot hold your opinion in when someone says to a room, ""All white people are bad"", and others nod in agreement, you might not want to do this program.

sidenote: I basically identified myself in this post. If you took this program with me, and you have qualms with how I described it, feel free to PM me. but the racial tension and climate of this program was not known to me, or to many other people, before I took this program. feel free to make a big ol comment of ur experience, I would love to see it.

double sidenote: anyone from my year want to talk about how there was: a supposed anti-black club, POC people got reprimanded for saying the n-word, sexual assault allegations that led to a student being relocated from the main housing? yeah all that shit happened. weird program huh."

It makes me *dread* trying to do work, and there’s only so long I can sit in a Starbucks  or library parking lot, and that’s not even a guarantee of a solid connection. Sometimes I just silently shed tears throughout my whole lecture (dramatic af, I know), because it’s just so fucking frustrating that it takes me waaaaaaay longer than it should to do anything.

# SEVP modifies temporary exemptions for nonimmigrant students taking online courses during fall 2020 semester

WASHINGTON – The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) announced modifications Monday to temporary exemptions for nonimmigrant students taking online classes due to the pandemic for the fall 2020 semester. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security plans to publish the procedures and responsibilities in the Federal Register as a Temporary Final Rule.

Temporary exemptions for the fall 2020 semester include:

1. Nonimmigrant F-1 and M-1 students attending schools operating entirely online may ***not*** take a full online course load and remain in the United States. The U.S. Department of State will not issue visas to students enrolled in schools and/or programs that are fully online for the fall semester nor will U.S. Customs and Border Protection permit these students to enter the United States. Active students currently in the United States enrolled in such programs must depart the country or take other measures, such as transferring to a school with in-person instruction to remain in lawful status. If not, they may face immigration consequences including, but not limited to, the initiation of removal proceedings.
2. Nonimmigrant F-1 students attending schools operating under normal in-person classes are bound by existing federal regulations. Eligible F students may take a maximum of one class or three credit hours online.
3. Nonimmigrant F-1 students attending schools adopting a hybrid model—that is, a mixture of online and in person classes—will be allowed to take more than one class or three credit hours online. These schools must certify to SEVP, through the Form I-20, “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status,” certifying that the program is not entirely online, that the student is not taking an entirely online course load this semester, and that the student is taking the minimum number of online classes required to make normal progress in their degree program. The above exemptions do not apply to F-1 students in English language training programs or M-1 students pursing vocational degrees, who are not permitted to enroll in any online courses.

Schools should update their information in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) within 10 days of the change if they begin the fall semester with in-person classes but are later required to switch to only online classes, or a nonimmigrant student changes their course selections, and as a result, ends up taking an entirely online course load. Nonimmigrant students within the United States are not permitted to take a full course of study through online classes. If students find themselves in this situation, they must leave the country or take alternative steps to maintain their nonimmigrant status such as a reduced course load or appropriate medical leave.

Due to COVID-19, SEVP instituted a temporary exemption regarding online courses for the spring and summer semesters. This policy permitted nonimmigrant students to take more online courses than normally permitted by federal regulation to maintain their nonimmigrant status during the COVID-19 emergency.

F-1 nonimmigrant students pursue academic coursework and M-1 nonimmigrant students pursue vocational coursework while studying in the United States."

**Pros of dating me**: All the time spent watching K-drama has given me an unrealistic expectation of whats socially acceptable in a relationship, so even if your first impression is that you're a literal piece of human shit, if you have money, I'll automatically assume you're actually a nice guy, will put up with all of your terrible behavior and insufferable personality, and will most likely choose you regardless of any other well-meaning, tall, beautiful shiny men that show interest in me. I'm also full of energy and always ready to throw the fuck down with your shitty evil aunt that somehow got control of your family's company and billions of dollars.

**Cons of dating me**: There's a 50% chance that you won't know I'm female until you know me for at least a year because I have a habit of disguising myself as a man. Also, because I literally believe I'm the protagonist of a korean drama, I have no fucking idea how to kiss anyone. My impression of kissing is two people just kinda touching mouths and staying like that for a minute while music plays in the background and the ads/credits roll. I also can't speak Korean. at all. The most I know is ""saranghaeyo"" and after that I just whip out my SAMSUNG(TM) smartphone and google translate everything else and hope for the best. I buy all my clothes from sketchy korean websites for foreigners and there's no guarantee that anything I wear fits the way it's supposed to. 

**Standards**: be korean be older than me so I can say ""oopparr,"" be rich with an evil aunt, and have an awful personality, but also have lots of hot friends who nobody understands why tf they would spend any time with you at all

I literally am not interested in anything, or, if anything does end up grabbing my attention, I lose the interest after a few days. I don’t mind pursuing a career in a field that I’m currently studying but the biggest reason of it is because it has a relatively better outlook. 

I have recurring dreams of going back to my high school because I feel like I’m not good enough to be here, and should go back to HS to relearn everything.

I know this may sound like I’m trying to brag, but I tend to think that the reason why I ended up with actually good grades is because maybe I’m not a complete piece of trash after all (but doesn’t mean I’m still not one) and the professor decided to be nice. Especially for last quarter, you know, with the pandemic and the protests.

Other classes? I had to change one of my classes last quarter from letter grade then to P/NP (and I didn’t pass) because I couldn’t bring myself to study. I don’t know why. It just doesn’t intrigue me, like everything else.

Yes, I have been diagnosed with depression. I have been on antidepressants for years. I have been this way since high school. The meds keep me sane enough to actually not kill myself and think somewhat clearly but it couldn’t change the fact that I literally cannot bring myself to be passionate about anything. My life is mediocre at best and so am I, and honestly speaking, getting into this school was the highest achievement of my life. 

I don’t want to kill myself and I have no intention of doing so. I believe it’s thanks to the meds, but it still is how it is. At least my mental heal is not at its absolute worst. 

I just wish I knew what the fuck I should do.

Also if anyone thinks my life actually is shitty or I shouldn’t belong here, could you kindly say so? I just want to face the truth."

I'm an upcoming freshman admitted to the class of 2024. I'm from South Korea, and I'm mandated to serve in the military for at least 18 months until I can get discharged. I plan to enlist this winter, and UCLA has approved my deferment request. However, the admissions told me that I would have to submit a new UC application on November 31st, 2021, which is a year prior to my discharge from the military. Does this mean that even though I have been admitted to UCLA this fall, I would have to write new personal insights and essays in order to be admitted again? If so, do I have a higher chance of being admitted than other students applying?

The rent in Westwood is like 1k-2k per person. In a house like that we could fit minimum 4 people and realistically 6 people. The rent would be cheap. We could use the money we save to pay for air conditioning and good wifi. Life would be good. And Im aware that 6 freshman living together isntt the best idea so maybe if a senior was in charge of the house(but then again seniors might have hybrid classes). I think this could work for serious people who have no where to study at home and would thrive living with like minded individuals. Idk its just something to consider.

Just curious to see if there are any current College Honors students on here, and if so, how are you managing to maintain your honors status during COVID? I know when I went through the program they were pretty strict about a) maintaining a high GPA, and b) taking a required amount of honors units per quarter. I'm not sure if the program has changed much in the last few decades, but back in my day honors classes were really small - basically graduate seminars for undergrads - and we had a lot of required meetings with professors and advisors. Is any of this possible for you guys with zoom and all that?

Also - I must know this - do they still have the College Honors lounge? It was a big conference room down the hall from the college honors office. I remember the honors adviser told us we could study there and it was our special nerd place but somehow the room was always locked. I think we did eventually have a study group meet there tho."

I got a 2bd/3p double which is almost what I wanted except I wanted a single. But since all my classes are online, I should probably decline it. I mean that's what my family expects me to do. My current home environment isn't that bad since I no longer live with my parents and brothers. That was a really toxic environment. I now live with my grandparents which is a much better environment. When I first told my parents that classes were going online, they wanted me to come to Nebraska (my grandparents live in Cali), and spend the school year there. I told them I would rather stay with my grandparents because I would not be able to focus on my classes at their house. They haven't mentioned it since, and I'm hoping they won't mention it again.  
Anyways, so the reason I am even considering this housing offer is because I was going to CAPS before this whole pandemic happened. I don't really have a private place to video call at my grandparents' house, and I don't want to ask them for privacy because then I would have to tell them I'm doing therapy. I feel like my grandma especially would judge me. She's a very judgy and naggy person which gives me anxiety. I'm literally afraid to cook around her because she will make comments about how I'm doing it wrong when the way I am doing it is perfectly fine. She just likes everyone to do everything a certain way. Also, the room I stay in at their house doubles as my grandma's computer room since there is a desktop computer in there. So she spends a lot of time in there on the computer, so that's why I can't really get privacy. I feel like I am overreacting especially since this environment is MUCH better than at my parents' house. However, I also really want to continue with therapy, because I feel so much anxiety and other stuff.  
Also, since the only friends I have (friends from high school) live near my grandparents' house and which is a three-hour drive from UCLA, I wouldn't be able to hang out with them if I accepted housing. I mean I can't hang out with them now with the coronavirus, but at some point when things are better I will be able to but then I would be three hours away. So yeah, the best option is probably just to stay at my grandparents' since I don't have any real reason to need housing and I'll be able to see my friends again at some point. The only problem is that I won't be able to continue therapy until next school year which is a long time from now."

Because of COVID the 2020-2021 academic year is basically online so I don't really have an opportunity for meaningful interaction with faculty until next year (maybe).

Grad schools across the board are insistent on 3 letters of rec from people who can vouch for my upper div knowledge so idk how I'd be able to make that happen. The only explanation I can think of is if I were to do some research the Summer before I apply for grad school (Summer 2021).

**I got a couple of Qs:**

1. How crucial is research experience for applying to grad school?
2. If I manage to show my competency in an upper div class can I just get a letter of rec from that instructor or are letters of rec meant to come from mentors/instructors in a research setting?
3. What is the status of research for the upcoming academic year? Will research groups that don't need to meet in-person still offer new positions?
4. I have 2 internships under my belt. Does that count for anything or are they pretty useless for grad school admissions?

Problem is there is this one panelist (let's call him Joe) who is making...some slightly cringy statements? I don't want to jump right ahead and call him racist or xenophobic, but I do think some of his comments regarding other panelists and the student attending is a little bit inconsiderate.

&amp;#x200B;

So one of the panelist (they all have their camera on) was answering one of the questions about what workplace values the most in data scientists, and she said communication. Joe interrupted her and asked where she was born, to which she answered California. Joe then said ""oh I asked this because this might be different for international students."" It is a little bit werid to bring up, considering most international students at UCLA don't have a major issue communicating in English. Some of the other panelists also cringed at his wording a little.

&amp;#x200B;

Later on other panelist is talking about how industry values work experience over a specialized degree, Joe jumped in and said ""I read the names of the student attending, and most of them are from Asia. In Asia, an advanced degree is required."" This is not entirely false, but it doesn't really only pertain to Asia. In the US if you want to be a data engineer or data scientist, most companies ask for a master degree or even a PhD, and that's because you master the skills they need in graduate school. Undergrad don't really provide ground for cutting-edge machine learning experience. If you just want to do data analytics, an undergrad degree is good enough. I just feel like his understanding of job market in Asia is a little bit inaccurate, but I don't think he has any malintent. But I do think since this is a panel hosted in the US, and all of the panelists work in the US, so most people attending this panel probably are looking for jobs in the US? So it seems a little bit uncanny to suddenly bring up Asian job market...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways I am just sharing my thoughts on this. I don't think Joe is racist or xenophobic, but he is being a little bit werid about this whole Asia thing."

I was wondering when people typically start the LS 7 series.

Also I heard LS 30 series is pretty easy as long as you put in decent effort.

I can either take the LS 7 Series with chem and math or wait until sophomore year and take it with ochem and physics. I personally think that the former will be easier (as I’m familiar with the material) but what do you guys think?

Also, if I do end up taking these 3 series (Chem 14, LS 30, LS 7) at the same time, which ones should I prioritize first when trying to get classes? —specifically for Winter/Spring quarter bc for orientation it’s kind of a rat race to see who can add their classes the fastest lol.

The sorority that i went into first initially captivated me as it looked like the type I wanted to associate with. It appealed as a chill group that would be loving and supportive that loved to hang out.   

Hazing definetely exists here without a certainty. It can get incredibly toxic too especially with the boys. I heard accounts that some were made to drink and then were made to fight their frat brothers. 

The events also discouraged bringing your significant others who werent apart of your soc/frat but often people would do so anyway. For biracial couples this was impossible because they would kick them out straight away or just glare at him making them uncomfotable to the point they just leave themselves. I'm not sure if this was intentional buy when trying to bring my boyfriend this was impossible and he was just refused entry on point 

Also another problem I faced was that no one respected my relationship. When at events that tied in with the asian frat guys knowing i was in a relationship would knowingly hit on me and would do so without care. It fustrated my boyfriend beyond belief. Guys would constantly only get to know you to have a fling and I heard a lot of FWB existed. 

a guy from an event had tried to hit on me and after rejecting me he began harassing my bf,  I showed the messages to my BF. After a few hours passed my bf messaged the guy to tell him to cut his shit and stop bothering me but he continued by sayimg he has yellow fever and that hes only dating me because i'm asian. When i showed my sisters they tried to justify by saying that they know him and he is very nice and contributes a lot so must have been drunk or high.

I feel like a lot of people in these soc/frats are racist but don't show it. I feel like i was instantly looked down for my preference in men and not dating within the same race. Some of my own sisters had questioned why i didnt date the same race and when i told them I didn't know they just kept throwing these explanations basically trying to subtly say that there's something wrong with me. This happened to all biracial couples in the groups. A lot of the same people went on to preach about BLM on instagram to fit in with a trend.

Lastly i felt forced at one point to join all the events. It was almost like if you didn't join you weren't dedicated and was a snake. My social circle often made me come to the events just to be there otherwise I was abandoning them. This would happen at the most randomest times. This would fustrate me as I would have incredible diffioculties trying to balance my time between social, college and my then bf."

Hello Bruins!

We're two grad students in our mid 20's and early 30's looking for a 3rd to complete our 3 bed / 2 bath apartment. Our current roommate is moving out for graduate school in another state, and we're looking to fill his void.

Looking for a single occupant only (No couples), and no pets unfortunately.

Also, The closest major intersection is Palms Blvd and National Blvd. Attached are pictures with a basketball for scale: https://imgur.com/a/GqhPEz6

Here's the summary:

* Private Bedroom (can be furnished)
* Shared bathroom with one roommate
* Your own Parking spot!
* Shared furnished living spaces (living room, kitchen, dining area)
* There's on-site laundry in the building.
* Next to Metro Train Palms Station (which takes you straight to DTLA, Santa Monica Pier, and more)

And here's what's required:

* A non-refundable $35 application fee for credit check (and hopefully you pass).
* Sept 1st is the ideal start date.
* Your share of utilities (electricity/internet/etc.) split 3 ways.


Send us a message, and tell us a bit about yourself!

Please do not refer to Berkeley as “#2 Public University.” This is not the proper way to refer to the University of California's original and flagship campus. #1, The Best, or The GOAT are all proper and acceptable ways to say it. #2, on the other hand, is not.

As the system's most prestigious and respected campus, we feel that it is important to honor and maintain an appropriate level of respect for our university's ranking. We feel that ""#2"" 
cheapens our brand and doesn't emphasize the incredible prestige associated with Berkeley.

While it may be acceptable to refer to all other UC campuses in lower ranks due to their lack of recognition and prestige, this is not acceptable for the flagship and most well-known 
campus, and we therefore request that you cease using the name ""#2"" to refer to our school. 

Thank you.

TL;DR

Don't say ""#2"" when referring to Berkeley."

Sad part is UCLA is not doing much to help students by being more flexible such as

1. allowing them to spend more than 12 qtrs,
2. be more flexible about major changes as the students have less interaction with others, professors, and clubs to help them decide within normal timelines
3. allow concurrent enrollment in community college classes that are equivalent, or not available at UCLA or have departmental restrictions.

I have tried to raise these at various online meetings but no response. Students should sign a petition to the dean or chancellor. I feel its their right to get some adjustments and accommodations.

I was going through the monotony of UZLA, doing work and studying for class. I was studying for a midterm I had today when I just started bawling. I’ve never cried over a test (maybe after lol) but I went from mildly annoyed with the material to just straight up crying. It was weird and I remember thinking “oh this is new.” Long story short it made me appreciate the professors and TAs that have been putting extra time and care into school this quarter. Those who send emails about how I specifically am doing in the class, where I can improve, etc (Dr Pfluegl comes to mind) even though they have hundreds of students. The TAs who have been answering my emails at absurd times like 5am. And the educators/mentors who have set aside class time and office hours to talk about current events and stressors and how to push through them. With everything that’s happening and midterms coming up it’s really clear who is stepping up to ensure our success and who is just counting the days till the end of the school year. So thank you, you’re appreciated. And to everyone else I wish you much luck this school year!

As someone who went to a low income school in the Bay Area I felt that the SAT was the biggest limit to getting into top schools. I had a decent GPA, but my SAT was meh likely due to teachers at my school having to dumb down the curriculum since most people at my school are low income. Along with that I didn’t have access to test materials, so I always felt the SAT was the biggest limiter to what college I can get into. With the removal of the SAT I don’t see the point in using race.

I think it is evident that the SAT only benefits people who go to high schools in wealthy neighborhoods or people who have access to magnet schools. People in rural areas or poor suburbs are out of luck. With the removal of it there is no need to use race."

Sometimes his load may seem insensitive but they do serve a purpose: students are encouraged to jerk off for themselves and reach the correct exhaust velocity by STROKING THEIR COCKS. What kind of an masturbator would he be if he simply cummed on all his students and didn't help them reach the right orgasm and instead spoon fed them all the cum like a bunch of fourth graders?

Students are also discouraged from constantly doing stupid things such as the grapefruit technique and unclear hand grip. And believe me guys, it's not easy to be a TA and have to deal with the same semen day in day out. So I empathize with Jake on this. I'm glad he takes a stand unlike other TAs and calls students out for their indolence. I'm sure has a lot on his plate right now, and it isn't helping him any to annoy him further with all the entitled attitudes and laziness that students constantly display in his class.

You guys can say whatever you want about the method, but at the end of the day no student is walking away from that class unprepared for masturbation. That's for sure. You can rest assure that you'll be fully competent in delivering cummies coming out of that class. Lots of students who end up advancing in their major end up thanking Jake for his tough love attitude and teaching style. You know why? Because that's how you learn."

I graduated UCLA in 2013. I came in as a transfer student and started classes Fall 2010. My UCLA experience was an utter shit show. Right smack In the middle of finals week of Fall 2010, my younger brother died and my grades immediately plummeted. 

After his death, I took a 6month hiatus from school to participate in grief therapy. 

You would think that the death of a sibling in the middle of finals week my first term would be enough of a hardship to experience throughout the entirety of a UCLA career, but that was just the start of the shit storm that followed.

It was about 4 months after my return to school that I started experiencing some debilitating physical symptoms. Turns out I have a rare pancreatic disorder. Just great. Then in Fall 2012 I required a feeding tube and had that placed in Winter 2013. 

Oh but then it gets better...

Fast forward to Summer session 2013.  I have 4 units to graduate and I failed my very last class to graduate. It was my first time I'd ever failed a class since the 8th grade. I had no choice but to return that fall. Interestingly enough I went from a failing summer class to a A that Fall.

My GPA as a result of this was an exceptionally annoying 2.967. 

Here's the deal though. Even though my GPA wasn't what I wanted, given the hardships I realized that my grades do not define me. I learned that school isn't the most important thing in life. I learned to be gentle with myself. 

If I could pass down some wisdom to those who are struggling with UCLA during the pandemic, I would tell you that your self worth isn't tied to your GPA. Be kind to yourself. I want to tell you that so long as you stick with it, don't give up, and focus on learning something your grades will follow. If am able to graduate UCLA despite what was arguably the worst three years of my life, you have a good shot of graduating too.  

^(Note: I don't like saying ""IF I CAN DO IT YOU CAN TOO!"" That always annoys me. Instead, all i'm saying if I can you have a good chance at being able to, too!)"

[w/ End Notes],40,14,2020-11-17 15:27:21,"So, I know we like to joke a lot about jerking off on this sub, but I was genuinely wondering if anyone else finds themselves doing it way more ever since zoom university started^1 ? Because I certainly have.

Idk, in a way I think it's kinda depressing - both the circumstances that led to this and the overindulgence itself. The fact that I'm alone in front of my computer all day due to online classes means I have more time to sit there and stroke it to porn^2 . Before, I didn't spend nearly as much time in front of a computer. I also didn't spend as much time alone, let alone inside the house.

At UCLA I usually took hand written notes on paper instead of a laptop, and preferred to spend time outdoors instead of indoors^3 . I did things like play intramural sports, take naps in the sculpture garden and Janss hill, and ride a boosted board around Westwood. And when I was in my room my two roommates were usually there so I didn't have much privacy. Opportunities for masturbation were seldom and not as ubiquitous as they are currently^4 . My point is that I was perfectly happy not being able to jack off if it meant I could enjoy the warm LA sun and do the things I enjoy. But now I'm back home caged up in my room with nothing but time to touch myself, and there's nothing good about it.

Nowadays, I get done with class and I just sit there tired, grumpy, confused all while I’m overwhelmed by a crushing feeling of loneliness. It's hard as heck to resist opening an incognito tab in Chrome^5 , typing xvideos^6 into the search bar, pulling my dick out, and then beating it off for the third time that day. Frankly, it’s sad. I just want to be at school again.

---------------------------------------

^1. Sometimes up to 4 times per day. 

^2. Interestingly, I've found that the more I do it the more desensitized my porn palate becomes. The videos I watch have become progressively weirder and more hardcore. Once you do it as often as I do your standard POV vid will not suffice. You will need something much heavier: like a 3-on-1 gang bang where every hole on the actor's body is occupied by a cock and where, in a surprising twist, they introduce an additional BBC (4 cocks total) which subsequently leads to a closeup shot of a single-hole DP that displays body offices stretched in ways you didn't think were possible.

^3. Where most masturbation occurs.

^4. Of course, that's not to say that I didn't masturbate at all before. But I hardly ever had the room to myself; doing it inside the room was a rarity. I had to settle for doing it inside the Hedrick showers and that's no fun. If you think about it, there's only two comfortable orientations to masturbate: sitting or lying down. Being in the shower meant you had to jerk it standing up, which is terrible in comparison. Thus, I rarely masturbated.

^5. The sad part is that I’ve become so apathetic about everything that I don’t even feel compelled to watch porn it in an incognito tab anymore. I just don’t care. I’ll open up a porn site on a regular tab like a psycho and not even bother to erase my history afterwards.

^6. Xvideos is by far the best porntube site around. Change my mind. All other sites pale in comparison."

First off, am I really as behind as I feel, or is it normal to not really think about graduate programs until now (third year)?

Secondly, does anyone have any recommendations for resources for post-graduate plans counselling? I've never really reached out to an academic counsellor up until now, but I'm planning on making an appointment with the honors counselling department, the math department's drop-in advising, and the CAC. The only thing is, I'm not sure if these are the right places to go to for help with post-graduate plans/advice.

I took all three of my finals with no idea of where my grade stood in the class because the TA’s had only graded roughly a third of the assignments in each class. When I consulted my professors to ask what my grade was (in two of the courses it was relatively low based on what had been graded, so I was concerned), they all told me that I shouldn’t worry because they curve everything at the end of the quarter anyway...

How are you supposed to make decisions about how you allocate studying time, advocate for your grades, or take classes P/NP if you have no idea what your grade is? And even if you did, it’s curved at the professors discretion (which could be anything) at the very last second? 

Long story short, I ended up P/NP a class I got an A in, and in a LG class I’m taking it now looks like I might get a low B...  So not only did I just voluntarily lower my GPA, but now grad schools look at my transcript and think that the class I passed must’ve been a low C or something. All of that could’ve been avoided if professors/ TAs were just transparent and timely with their grading and curving policies, because it’s really hard to try and maintain a good GPA when you’re in the dark about your grades all the time— which seems to happen wayyy too much here (In all four quarters I’ve been here, I think I’ve only had one class where assignments were graded within a week)"

The Math Department is happy to tell you about a new course sequence which is of interest to all our majors, and perhaps other students as well.  In response to student requests and in an effort to improve our offerings, a new sequence in Numerical Analysis is being offered, starting Winter 2021 (enrollment will open in a week or two).

Numerical Analysis is the mathematics underlying approximate computational solutions to problems.  It is a rich and diverse subject and in the standard 151A and 151B many important computational methods are covered. However, in 151A and 151B the emphasis is on implementation, not on understanding the accuracy of approximations or the convergence of algorithms.  These topics are also suitable for a first course sequence in numerical analysis but it is best to add 131A as a prerequisite. Since many students take 151A after taking 131A, and since quite a few students have requested a course in which such topics are addressed, the new sequence makes sense. In addition, the new course will emphasize examples in areas of current interest such as imaging and data science. The syllabus of 151AH is online at [https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/courses/](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/courses/) and the syllabus of 151BH will be posted early in Winter quarter. 151AH and 151BH are designed by Prof. Luminita Vese and Prof. Daniel McKenzie. They will be taught in Winter and Spring 2021 by Daniel McKenzie who is an excellent teacher.

The course has been created as an “honors course” but this is just a label and we used it because we wanted to create honors courses especially for the applied math track. You do not need to plan to enter the Honors program for your major to take it. In fact, the term “honors” here is used to represent the fact that the course sequence is an “upgrade” of 151AB. However, with respect to our Honors programs, 151AH and 151BH can be substituted for any of the honors courses except 115AH required by the current Honors programs for any of the majors except Mathematics. For example, the Applied Mathematics honors program currently requires 115AH, 131AH, 131BH and 132H. So you could take 115AH, 151AH, and 151BH and 132H."

so i went to planned parenthood a few days ago to get the implant (nexplanon) but they told me they couldn't give it to me because I have a private insurance as well as my medi-cal, so the private insurance has to do it. I completely forgot to waive UCSHIP for the fall quarter, and I forgot I had it when I went to PP., so after I left I called the number they gave me for Anthem Blue Cross. I asked them to please remove this private insurance (still didn't remember UCSHIP, dumb I know), and they told me it would take 10 days and to call back to see if it was removed or not.

So I have two questions:

1. How long is coverage? I already waived it for winter quarter, but when is fall coverage over?! 
2. Can I get nexplanon through UCSHIP for free?? I get my BC from PP for free, so would it be the same with UCSHIP or will I be charged a co-pay or fee???
3. Was it bad to call Anthem Blue Cross and ask them to remove the insurance? Will I be charged a fee? (if no one knows, no problem, i should've asked them directly).

I qualify for free BC with planned parenthood and I'd like to take advantage of that, but UCSHIP is in the way. Any help on these questions would be greatly appreciated, as I would like to get this implant ASAP!! TYSM TO ANYONE WHO READ EVERYTHING!"

I have taken the advice from many people to move further with the incomplete instead of taking the final this Friday. Even though I am fully prepared mentally(knowledge wise), I am yet to recover physically to endure a 3 hour final exam. 

My doctor has told me she has never seen a case like me in over 20 years. I have received both of the most common types of practices for the removal of the appendix. I don't exactly remember the specific names of the surgeries but the surgeon started with one type and was forced to change to the other type during the surgery. 

Now I am thinking of recovering without having anything to worry about and take a quarter off. I don't know exactly how to proceed with this. Will i declare non-attendance? Will I simply not pay my tuition? How will this affect my incomplete class from this quarter? Will I be able to take the final exam the quarter I return?

I’m a current first year student and I have a slight problem. I was wondering if anyone can give me advice, it would be greatly appreciated! 

I plan on graduating with a Chinese double major. In order to do so, I need to take Intermediate Chinese (Chinese 5A) by my sophomore year. I took Chinese 1A last quarter, but got put on the waitlist for 2A. I was told that it’s rare for kids to get off of the 2A waitlist. But, they only offer 2A in the winter. The thing is, I really don’t want to take this class in person when school reopens because it’s an extremely difficult course. I only got an A because we were online. I can’t enroll in regular Chinese 2 because I already was placed on the advanced track. I can’t take the immersion courses over summer either because it’s only the regular track. The UC Cross Enrollment doesn’t offer Chinese either, so I can’t take it at other classes. The department also doesn’t give out PTEs. 

If I do not get off the waitlist, I’m basically screwed. I was wondering if I could just take up to intermediate Chinese at my own state school and receive credit, but I’m not sure how strict UCLA is. If not, could I possibly petition it? 

Sorry if I was confusing. Any advice helps. I plan on emailing the registrar’s office and the head of the Chinese department, but I’m not even sure who that is. I saw the guy who’s the head of the Asian Languages and Cultures Department, but I don’t know if talking to him would even do anything."

P/NP is very attractive because i want to maintain a good GPA. I’d love to know your thoughts wether or not I should pursue that, considering the following:

- as an engineer, am I allowed to P/NP this class ? Who should I ask to be sure I can?

- i’ve already P/NP physics1C, so this would be my 2nd P/NP class. Is there an “acceptable” limit in regards to how UCLA sees it, and especially how graduate schools see it?

- is there a chance there will be a curve? I think the class average is a B.

They're inherently a system of embezzlement,30,6,2021-01-31 01:45:50,"As we know, universities have high turnover every year. People graduate, and the incoming classes comprised of completely new students pay for fees they never consented to. They pay for fees that students who no longer attend the school voted for into perpetuity. This would be more palatable if there was an expiration date on these fees or a mandatory election after a certain period of time to answer the question ""Should we keep these fees: Yes or No?"" But there isn't. And they don't want that. There's no sunset date on these fees - they potentially exist forever and make it hard for any one person to change. 

And when this is brought up, USAC gets angry and says ""Well do something about it then."" Sorry, but not everyone has the time or can afford to spend the energy to run a campaign when they're barely managing to get through their school work. Workload heavy majors are especially at a handicap in student government affairs. We just can't dedicate 20 hours a week to changing the system all on our own.

But anyway, why should the class of 2006 or whatever get to decide what I pay in student fees in 2021? This is inherently a system of embezzlement that continues to suck out and misuse student funds that were siphoned during elections with terribly low turnout that occurred many years ago. Monies which are now being used for things nobody actually wants or cares about. Moreover, [millions of these funds are unaccounted for](https://dailybruin.com/2020/01/20/editorial-millions-of-dollars-unaccounted-for-in-usac-committees-funded-by-students). I think USAC is inherently a system of embezzlement, and should give back back to the students any money they've collected during Zoom university. It's a fraud.

Then they try to argue that USAC isn't to blame for the loss of millions. But if USAC has so little oversight and control over what happens to the funds, then that essentially makes the case that they are even more useless than we thought and incapable of even regulating themselves. These hard earned dollars should be returned to students and then both the departments + USAC should be stripped of power for being incompetent. 

All the years of drug parties, and unaccounted for millions, embezzlement of student fees, and money spent on stuff nobody asked for has got to stop."

I’m a 14 year old freshman boy from Texas. UCLA has been my dream school for a while. I don’t know exactly how to get in, so I decided to ask someone people that’s already got in. I hope y’all don’t mind.

So I want to major in engineering and minor in music. I’m moving to California because two of the industries I want to get into are much bigger there, which are music and technology. I would love to be in the music industry, but since that’s a low probability of happening, I’m studying computer engineering, another field I absolutely love. I’m already in a high school engineering class. My grades right now are A’s and B’s... but before the pandemic started, they were all A’s and I think they’ll rise back soon. Anything else I need to know? 

I have some notable personal facts of they mean anything. I’ve been a singer and pianist since I was 4, and I started producing when I was 12. My biggest performance was at Carnegie Hall. I’ve been the pianist at a church since I was 11, I’m a graphic designer, those are a few facts about me. Would those improve my chances? Anything I can do to raise my chances?

I'm from a more suburban part of the Bay Area, and I was super excited for a change in scenery and the move to Los Angeles. But ever since I've lived here I've just missed home. Even in the urban-most parts of SF, you can look beyond skyscrapers and see a patch of green on a hill somewhere, or drive a few miles and find someplace quiet. In LA you can look 360 degrees without seeing any sign of nature, (or a tree, for that matter) and at least in Westwood, there is an inescapable hum of the hopsital generators, or sunset boulevard that just drives me crazy. It seems like there's no hallowed history here, no attempt at preserving anything, no room to breathe, no place that's quiet and untouched... I know this all sounds weird and poetic but that's the only way I can think to phrase it. 

I love other parts of So-Cal, Santa Barbara is awesome and filled with natural beauty, hikes to go on, (non-crowded) beaches to explore, mountains to look at.  I love other big cities: New York is filled with history, old landmarks and brick buildings, accessible public transit, a buzz of energy and a concerted culture fostered over generations. LA is just really not what I was expecting. Maybe I need a car to explore it more, but right now it just seems suffocating and sterile. It just seems like there are endless noisy freeways, strip malls, and dull suburbs. Pockets of culture, natural beauty, or anything unique and interesting are far and in between. 

Did anyone else have a similar experience when first moving here/ did LA ever grow on you? What did you have to do to like Los Angeles?"

I applied to UCLA as a freshman just this year (I am currently a senior in high school) and I just got a weird request from UCLA the other day. I'm not quite sure what it means. They emailed me asking to elaborate on some information in my application, giving me an extra 600 words for each question (one is about a special talent and the other is about any circumstances that hindered my academic performance). In the email they also noted that they are requesting this supplemental information on an ""individual basis"" and that not everyone is being asked to share more.

Is this a good sign? In my mind, this could be an indication that one reviewer wants to admit me but another does not, so they may have requested more information because they are looking for a reason to admit me.  To me this would be good because I was sure that my application would be dead on arrival.

(A little background on me, and why I feel that the case may be that one reviewer could have approved my application and another reviewer rejected it: I held strong grades and few extracurriculars/hobbies/volunteer groups which I am extensively involved in, and I believe my essays were very compelling. However, the switch to online learning was a huge struggle for me and I failed multiple classes without the option to get a pass/no pass, which I described in the COVID-19 question.)

Has anyone else received a request like this and gotten into UCLA? I recognize that failing classes in high school nearly guarantees rejection from a school like UCLA and I applied with this in mind, but seeing this email has gotten my hopes up. If anyone has any idea what this request might indicate please let me know. Thank you :)

when i was first accepted into ucla, i had aspirations in going to med school because “everyone expected that of me.” however, in my heart, i always knew that wasn’t meant for me. so i considered other options to focus on, like pharmacy school or even physician assistant, but at the same time, i still have doubts that these options are for me also.

i guess i feel a bit guilty because my true aspirations don’t even require a degree. i’m interested in phlebotomy, writing, and maintaining my small business. phlebotomy doesn’t require a degree, and if you have connections, you can get a good job without that much experience under your belt. with my current writing job, i can easily start making $2k-$3k monthly just starting out (and i’m only 18!!) and my small business has recently started kicking off and earning me an extra $300-$400 monthly with the potential for further growth. i did all this by pursuing my interests and without the need for a degree at all. connections and passion is what gets you through the door at most places anyways.

my guilt comes from 1. wanting to stray away from the expectations of my family, since they want me to graduate and get my degree and 2. if i end up dropping out, i potentially took the spot of someone who would have done something more productive here at ucla and i took that opportunity from them. idk. i’m doing things i love but it’s a huge shift from the life i once envisioned for myself in high school.

i also think this perspective can give some solace to people who feel inferior or disadvantaged from a lack of degree: you are just as capable as anyone else. you can accomplish A LOT without a degree and it’s not the end of the world if you don’t get it. you are still capable of contributing a lot into this world, especially if you choose to stray away from academia entirely and pursue your passions that don’t require a degree.

sorry for the long rant but it’s been on my mind and the pandemic has shaken up my outlook on many, many things. i hope everyone is feeling alright as we near the end of week 2."

I think I should be able to work with this therapist well, and so fat I have been seeing her online. However, eventually she would like me to meet her at her office, with noted precautions due to COVID.

I'm considering it to try to get out and explore the city on my own to reduce my own parental instilled paranoia of ""you cant take care of yourself, you're a naive child"" and hits like ""if something happens to you, it will be your fault"". Otherwise known as reasons why I am going to therapy to begin with. My parents dont even know I've started up therapy again and they would try to bar me from going in any way possible if they found out, or involve themselves so much it would become a hassle to go. For example, I made a run to the Bank of America to deposit money, went to target to browse and tried a local place coming back to the hill on new years eve. I later told my mom and she got angry with me for going alone (when anyone I knew here was away and I desperately need to have money before isolation and the quarter starting) and suggested having my younger brother (17) drive out from our city 30 minutes away to make him drive me wherever I need to go, otherwise I would be ""unsafe"". I am 22, and they neglected teaching me how to drive other than forcing me out into Palmdale and repeatedly telling me how afraid I was of driving. I was afraid of learning with them and ended up cracking due to performance anxiety in th car with them, I couldn't do it.

The only problem is I don't have a car and I don't think her office is on the bus route anymore and I was just wondering if anyone had any recommendations for getting around Westwood safely. If there is anything about the bus routes I can try, i will. If all else fails, I'll try to uber to her office and see how much that will cost me."

You can invite it with this link:

[https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client\_id=781761500175532083&amp;permissions=18496&amp;scope=bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=781761500175532083&amp;permissions=18496&amp;scope=bot)

The idea is that the bot will DM you whenever a class you're tracking changes from ""open"" to ""closed"", ""closed"" to ""open"", etc.

&amp;#x200B;

[Here's a message I got a couple days ago when the Schedule got revealed](https://preview.redd.it/u3qxnqy0ayd61.png?width=707&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ecb2be6ed010b0a6cc322a01d24e6f0d5e03039)

How do you tell what classes you want the bot to track for you?

&amp;#x200B;

Once you search the class, you can choose one of them emojis that correspond with the lecture you want to add it to you ""watchlist"". When a class is on your watchlist,

&amp;#x200B;

And unlike Coursicle, you can add as many classes to this ""watchlist"" as you'd like.

There are also ""just for fun"" features, like looking up stroke orders for Japanese words:

And last and most importantly, you can get Speedchat phrases.

Here's a list of example commands:

&amp;#x200B;

|Command|Explanation|
|:-|:-|
|`~help`|Displays brief explanation of all commands|
|`~search_class LS7A`|Searches for all class offerings called ""Math 142"" during default term (Spring 2021), and presents choices if you want to add to your watchlist.|
|`~search_class gLb hLt 100 --term 18W`|Same command as above, but searches in 18W. Notice subject can be whatever caps, but needs to be the correct abbreviation (instead of Global Health, you should write GLB HLT). If you don't know the abbreviation, You can try typing the subject into the [Schedule of Classes](https://sa.ucla.edu/ro/Public/SOC).|
|`~subject JAPAN`|Displays the titles of all courses being offered by the JAPAN department.|
|`~subject LING --deep --term 16F`|Displays embeds (holding lots of info like instructor, meeting times, etc.) for every class in the LING department that was offered in Fall 2016.|
|`~see_watchlist`|Displays the classes that you (the author of the command) are tracking.|
|`~display_class`|Same as `search_class`, but doesn't present with options to add to watchlist, and instead shows class description. Useful if you're just curious about a class, or are showing someone else a fun class.|
|`~clear_classes`|Clears all tracked classes from your watchlist.|
|`~remove_class`|Presents all classes in your watchlist similarly to `see_watchlist`, but gives option to remove a single class using emoji selection.|

I'm a not-so-careful programmer, so please let me know of any issues! I hope it can be helpful to you!"

I’m immunocompromised. Not like, I had asthma that I grew out of when I was 10. Like if I got covid it’d spread through me faster than it could be treated and I’d probably die. I’ve been absolutely terrified for nine months now, and I’m not sure how much more being scared my system can take. At the same time, just getting the vaccine isn’t a sure shot of never getting covid, so I’m pretty sure I’m still gonna be terrified if we go back to campus in Fall. I’m not sure I will ever be able to trust others with my health or go anyplace with less than 6 ft of space between people. I’m not even sure I want to be a premed anymore and expose myself to these kinds of things in the future. 

Ok rant over sorry lmk if you have some thoughts"

For those who don’t know what shingles is, it’s a reactivation of the chickenpox virus in the body, causing a painful rash. 

My mom got it on her back, which makes the symptoms awfully worse. 

But what’s important is it it lasts a few weeks to a few months, and is nothing fatal. 

Now’s the part where I’m a terrible child: I can’t take this anymore. She makes so much noise and I just cannot work. How am I gonna perform well for my proctored exams when she’ll be in the background screaming of pain?

I live in an awfully small apartment, and there is no where else for me to go to study. 

Should I tell my professors about this? What sort of solutions could they offer me or could I suggest? 

Also is this a valid reason to ask for housing? Because I sincerely can’t take this anymore.

Hope this really stops Omegas from ever recruiting again. You have 5 months to come up with new hazing rituals. Your move

Some traditions/secrets:

Bagging: Carrying actives for a count. Main way of reducing points. After bagging you need to give food before you can do again. Essentially a free way for actives to use pledges swipes.

Points: The level of hazing done during hell week. You have to work off the points before hell week is over.

Interviews: you will be required to get signatures from each active to show that you were able to get an interview with them. Interviews range from hazing to just a talk. Try to get them done as soon as possible, because the tasks only get worse the longer you wait.

Bottom pledge: The weakest pledge will be mercilessly picked on for no reason other than not being physically strong enough to keep up. Don't be that guy. A queue will be defined after about two weeks

Captain: The pledge that will be the face of the class. Also mercilessly picked on much like the bottom pledge

Pledge Dad: The ""hell mistress"" of the frat. The one in charge of all the hazing events that year. If anyone is to be reported for the hazing, its him.

Memorization: ""Required"" to memorize all classes, their presidents, treasurers, pledge mom, greek alphabet, actives and their bigs.

Meetings: Places for actives to call out all the minor and major transgressions they observed in the pledge class. Each one will be followed up by a punishment

Hazing duration: Until Presidents' Day holiday. So a quarter and a half

Important haze events:

Bid night: Drink three handles between 5 pledges usually in your family in a very twisted version of Loyality. Your assigned big will be standing behind you with a garbage bag and insist you throw up as soon as you put down the bottle. Most pledges will be throwing up throughout the night.

First meeting - Learn to line up and get yelled by actives.

Tackle football event 1- bruises, cuts, concussions. The actives take this opportunity to tackle the uncoordinated pledges mercilessly in a game of football. Obviously no safety equipment

Second meeting - Physicals hazing starts. Pushups are a norm

Chow Mein night: First Chi Alpha Delta night. All pledges line up and take turns eating chow mein covered in siracha with hands behind their backs. Bigs will be on hand to wipe the burning away from the eyes. Followed immediately by the party, but if you are seen eating anything from the Chis you will get mercilessly pledged the next meeting.

Santa Monica night: Bring pledges to Santa Monica Pier and forced to be pledged and run on the beach. No water pledging yet, but they will threaten it. Hazing till around 4 AM, before they bring you to get Pho to make you feel better.

Vegas trip: welcome to doing mildly humiliating ""tasks"" with photo proof for deduction of points. Accumulating in a visit to a strip club.

Beach nights: Now you get in the water and do pushups and situps in the water. Have fun walking back into your dorms at 4 AM covered in sand and wet clothes. Many sick days

Norcal trip: See vegas trip, but instead of a strip club, the highlight is eating spicy wings. Number eaten = points deduction

Raw onion night: One beach night towards the end will require you all to eat a raw onion. Watch for raw tongues and mouths for a day or two after. Stick to lukewarm soups and few solids.

Hell meeting: Old graduated alumni come back to powertrip over pledging again. ""No control of their own lives, so they come back to pledge pledges to feel better about themselves"" Note: You will be required to shave your head for this meeting.

Tackle football game 2 - Pledges more coordinated, but the actives are even more out for blood. No holds barred intentionally trying to hurt each other.

Auction night: You will be auctioned off to fundraise for hell week. If actives get their hands on you, you will be required to clean the omega house, which is considerably dirty since its a frat house. That and pledging/servicing them basically.

Hell week: Drive up to somewhere in the mountains. A couple days away from technology and food. Required to buy supplies. Only food you get during pledging is a pickle and raw onions. Hope you like doing pacers and planks for hours. One tent to share among all pledges, so better get close and cuddly with your fellow pledges to keep warm. Supplies: a shovel, a bucket, change of clothes, two olives and a pickle, bengay, yoga mat, duffle bag. I think thats all youre allowed to bring in entirety. 

Edit: Dont bother trying to apologize for it. The people who did this to me never did, so what do I care about people who arent involved? Every year the actives apologize to last year's pledges and promise that this year will be different, but the cycle never changes. Its the most insincere bullshit Ive ever heard and an excuse to continue power tripping over your loss of control of your own lives to make other people's lives worse. If you want to change then actually change, or die trying."

I want to hear from you!,68,72,2021-02-02 18:45:41,"*TLDR: My name is Elijah Simas, a 2nd-year electrical engineering student planning on running for USAC as Facilities Commissioner during this upcoming election season. As a true undergraduate representative, I want to form my platform and campaign based on input from the community. I’d like to use the comment section below to create an open forum where* ***YOU*** *can voice your opinions and thoughts on UCLA, USAC, political slates, and anything in between. All I ask is that you please keep it civil.*

If you made it past the TLDR, thanks for being here and I hope you’re interested in hearing a little more about who I am and why I would even consider running for USAC. The purpose of this post is to primarily serve as an introduction of myself as a candidate and create a dialogue with the community about important issues. If I am vague in my goals and driving reasons to run, it is because I am still forming them and doing research on many topics that are affecting UCLA students. Consider this the first of many posts here to come on the UCLA subreddit!

As I mentioned previously, my name is Elijah Simas and I’m just beginning to piece together my campaign and platform as a candidate for Facilities Commissioner in the upcoming USAC elections. As a South Campus student studying electrical engineering, running for USAC was not in my four-year plan. However, after last year’s election, I decided to learn more about USAC and what they do (or fail to do) for the undergraduate student body with their approximately [$9,000,000 annual budget](https://dailybruin.com/2020/03/16/usac-to-withhold-800k-from-two-committees-until-budget-breakdowns-are-revealed). In theory, with a budget so large USAC should be able to at least:

1. Finance facility improvements and repairs throughout campus and [the Hill](https://dailybruin.com/2020/01/07/covel-renovations-misguided-updating-necessary-hill-facilities-should-take-priority). This includes: fixing elevators, updating restrooms, improving accessibility for disabled students, just to name a few improvements.
2. Invest more into solar and renewable energy solutions through the use of [The Green Initiative Fund.](https://www.sustain.ucla.edu/get-involved/the-green-initiative-fund/)
3. Provide larger and more exciting events than just an annual BruinBash featuring [Masego and DaBaby](https://dailybruin.com/2019/09/24/bruin-bash-garners-mixed-reactions-safety-concerns-after-dababys-performance).
4. Reduce textbook fees and increase accessibility to [course resources](https://dailybruin.com/2017/09/21/jacqueline-alvarez-asucla-bookstore-needs-improved-textbook-rental-system).
5. Allocate funds and provide support to [student centers](https://dailybruin.com/2020/02/23/editorial-cae-renovations-improve-office-space-but-not-larger-accessibility-issues) for underrepresented and disadvantaged students without further increasing the [USAC fee by \~15%](https://dailybruin.com/2020/05/04/the-history-of-referendums-on-usac-ballots-what-students-are-paying).
6. Develop a platform to more effectively connect and interact with the student body.

While I understand and recognize that many of the issues in USAC are deeply rooted in its founding legislation and the system it operates on, this should be no reason to accept the lack of progress and output from USAC over the years. For this reason, I’m attempting to be the change I want to see within our student government and have decided to campaign for a council seat. Change is possible, and even if I am to win, I know that I will not be able to reform USAC by myself in a single year. However, I can and will be a vocal advocate for reform and help lay the groundwork for a future council that listens to its constituents and provides solutions.

While I wasn’t ASB president in high school, a volunteer for a political campaign in the 2020 elections, or even a previous USAC office intern. I believe that the most important qualities of a candidate come from their engagement with the community they represent. Looking back at last year’s elections, the political slates “[For The People](https://dailybruin.com/2018/04/23/for-the-people-slate-aims-to-empower-student-groups-by-addressing-inequity)” and “[Cost-Cutting Innovations](https://www.facebook.com/cci.ucla/)” both ran on valid positions and policy proposals, but neither was absolutely perfect. Personally, I’m disappointed that partisan politics has seemingly engulfed the USAC election process. As warned by George Washington, there is no winner in a representative system divided into factions.

Looking at historical data from USAC elections, my odds of winning any position are greatly reduced if I am not listed under a slate. Despite knowing this, I plan to run as an independent candidate and be true to myself and those I am campaigning to represent. This does not mean I oppose or am adamantly against the fundamentals that any slate runs on. As a first-generation college student, the only son of two immigrant parents, a Pell grant recipient, amongst other class-identifying terms, I support and appreciate the platform that “For The People” runs on. Similarly, as an engineer from South Campus, I appreciate the calls from “Cost-Cutting Innovations” for increased efficiency and transparency from USAC.

I’ve chosen to run for Facilities Commissioner as I feel that my personal traits, skills, and industry experiences as an engineering student and intern are best suited for the responsibilities associated with the position. While we all appreciate our beautiful UCLA campus (the campus is one of the main reasons I chose to attend UCLA), we cannot disregard the fact that many improvements can be made. I also realize that many of us (including myself) have not been on campus for nearly a year now and there are many transfers and 1st-years who have never set foot on campus. However, it’s more important than ever to ensure our facilities are accommodating for all students as we return to campus in a post-pandemic world. I am surprised that the current Facilities Commissioner did not take advantage of the closed campus to conduct larger-scale facility improvement projects that would otherwise interrupt student life. As Facilities Commissioner, some initiatives I am in support of include:

1. Making campus [more accessible](https://dailybruin.com/2019/10/31/reasonable-accessibility-of-on-campus-elevators-questioned-by-usac-commissioner) for disabled students. Campus audit for ADA requirements.
2. Promote and invest in increasing sources of [renewable energy](https://dailybruin.com/2019/01/10/student-organization-paves-path-to-sustainability-with-renewable-energy-projects) on campus.
3. Fix broken seats and tables in lecture halls (Moore 100, MS 4000A, etc.)
4. [Updating bathrooms](https://dailybruin.com/2019/05/28/students-voice-concerns-about-bathroom-policy-security-camera-monitoring). Fixing broken stalls and sinks. Adding privacy dividers to urinals.
5. Fix broken or slow elevators and ensure permits are up to date.

If you’ve stuck with me thus far in the post. I thank you for your curiosity and attention. Please reach out to me if you have any questions, comments, or feedback. This is just the beginning! As time goes on, I will establish myself on other social media platforms. For the time being, Reddit is my only means of communication regarding my campaign.

I’m a 3rd year pre-med student and I truly believe that I’ve been wasting my time these past 3 years in regards to being a part of programs or labs and that I haven’t done anything truly relevant towards reaching my goals of getting into the medical field. On the academic side of things, I’ve been doing relatively okay but could use some room for improvement, however this isn’t my main concern. To sum it up, I’m freaking out because I don’t feel like I have the time or the experience to make myself a good candidate for med school. The programs I’m in right now are great in my opinion, but I don’t feel like they really contribute to my pre-med resume if that makes any sense. I’ve spent all my efforts trying to get into competitive programs to no real avail, and as a result I didn’t explore many other opportunities. 

There are a few theories I have for this, ranging from me being a first-gen student that went into a school like this not knowing how to navigate the pre-med environment to feeling too overwhelmed with classes to explore and put time into extracurriculars. I wish I could go back 3 years and be smarter about all this, but that’s just not possible.

I know that none of this defines me as a person, but I just feel like I dropped the ball and now I’m stressing out as a result. If any pre-meds both past and present have advice to give, please do so. 

tl;dr: 3rd year pre-med is currently freaking out because he feels like he wasted the last 3 years and doesn’t have the time to make up for it."

Looking for advice, consolation, commiseration, or anything that'll push me in a positive direction

So for context, usually I get all As or close to it with minimal studying. Hate me if you will for it, but rest assured, this quarter has absolutely slapped the fuck out of me. As in, bitch slapped me across the face so hard that all my bones disintegrated and my body collapsed inward.

Atm I've gotten 2 Ds on midterms (in the same class wtf), an F on a project that's worth 33% of my grade, probably a C average on midterms in another class (still waiting for grades), and probably a D on an incomplete paper I submitted for another class. Scraping by in a couple other small classes that are participation based. Oh and I dropped a class during week 7 already

I study but still do poorly. Can't seem to find  the motivation to do projects either. It's not like I'm stupid. I have more acumen and mental clarity this quarter than ever before.  My thoughts are incisive. Yet everytime I get a midterm or project result back it's bad. Like, cortisol levels skyrocketing through the roof bad. Then the anxiety, worry, and all that fun stuff set in. Right now I'm a nervous wreck. Fingers trembling while I type this lol

I'm doing 2 classes p/np (gotta pick the ones where I'm least likely to do ok....cuz I'm struggling in all of them lmao) and will probably scrape Cs/Bs in the others.  I honestly have no idea what I'm going to do. I'm graduating this year and applying to ""high rank"" professional schools this cycle, and this quarter is going to put a bigass stain on my record. Can't withdraw completely either because I need a letter of rec from one of my professors. And can't get any scholarships either, because of these grades. The weak gonna get weaker while the strong get stronger. 

On top of it all, I'm pretty sure I have SAD and/or bipolar (ii) disorder. Can't get diagnosed bc no ucship &amp; caps is crap from what I've heard. And the closest center where my insurance covers the visit is hella far away. The best I'm doing right now is self-medicating with probiotics and sunlight exposure, but it's a poor substitute for proper treatment or therapy. So for those who thought they're doing poorly...DW the grass is not as green on this side ;)

Part of this post is for catharsis. Need to get this shit off my chest. The other part of it is to hear any comments or suggestions y'all may have to push me in the right direction. 

Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.

Can someone explain to me why a school like Indiana University sends about 80 kids a year into investment banking while UCLA only sends like 25-30 at max? Outside of that, Indiana University has dedicated workshops all across the board for other business careers as well that successfully propel students into other high finance careers outside of investment banking, like capital markets, wealth management, and other business roles like consulting.

Look here: [https://kelley.iu.edu/programs/undergrad/academics/workshops/index.html](https://kelley.iu.edu/programs/undergrad/academics/workshops/index.html)

Meanwhile, UCLA, although it claims to want to boost its numbers, only took 16 students this year into its prestigious IB Sharpe Fellows program, and about 20 kids into its workshop (with pretty much every kid from Sharpe in workshop). Also, the investment banking workshop at UCLA is run by students, so a lot of times, it's students letting their friends in. While at Kelley, it's run by faculty, so they're able to judge their students based on merit, and not which clubs they're in and who they're friends with. Speaking of clubs, we have a bunch of selective clubs here that make everything worse for everyone as well, destroying hopes of underclassman who can't get into those clubs their first and second years.

For a top 20 school, why the fuck is our career center so content with sending the majority of our Business/Econ majors into shitty paying accounting roles every single fucking year? UCLA loves to brag about they admit a shit ton of first generation college students - okay, well the poverty cycle is gonna fucking continue if all you do is send them into audit. Pretty much all the kids who nab those successful IB/consulting jobs are UCLA are privileged/rich - I seriously don't think I've met a single one who was a first-generation or low income student.

Consulting recruiting is pretty bullshit here too - we only send about 5-7 kids a year into MBB, and probably about 10 more into T2 firms. Berkeley, Michigan, UVA alone send about 20 kids into MBB, and another shit ton into T2. Meanwhile, UCLA is content with sending a bunch of kids into fake consulting roles like Deloitte Tech and Accenture Tech Development Program.

Just wanted to rant here. My friends at UVA have such an easy time with recruiting because their clubs matter less and their alumni push for them, while it's been kinda rough for me at UCLA. Just wish the career center saw this shit and revamped recruiting at UCLA, instead of letting everything be ran by the kids who knew they wanted to be in banking since freshman year of high school because their parents were."

I've never had classes in person at UCLA so not that familiar with the area tbh.

I know there have been a lot of housing posts (sorry to add one more!) but I wanted to ask y’all specifically how things are, given the COVID-19 pandemic. I am not confident of getting housing through UCLA.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Generally, I seriously apartment hunt 1-2 months before the ideal start date. Most of the leases I’ve seen around LA is a year long lease so a July/Aug start date seems ideal. Is this 1-2 months before start date still ideal, given COVID? I know there may not be demand for housing *right now* but it’ll definitely pick up in the next couple of months as everyone is going to try to find housing?  
I imagine all of the move-in specials and incentives might disappear once landlords see all this demand. *Basically, is it realistic to start apartment hunting “now” for a start date of July/August?* (Looking at apartments in Sawtelle, Culver City, Mars Vista, Palms) 
2. Can someone specify what the apartment application process is like for this area? Namely, if there are income requirements in the applications you’ve experienced? And how competitive? 
3. Any apartments/management companies to avoid, based off your experience or hearsay? I’ve seen Axiom &amp; Premier Student Housing to avoid so far.
4. I wish I could just walk the streets and collect phone numbers/see what apartment buildings are available, but like many, I’m not in the area so my best bet is online resources. [Apartments.com](http://apartments.com/), zillow, and padmapper are sites I’ve browsed so far. Any other one you’d recommend?

Any insight on apartment hunting would be really appreciated.

Thanks! Hope this post ends up being helpful to others, too!"

My concern is that I do find myself somewhat enjoying programming for fun, but I pretty much did not enjoy myself in CS31 and CS32.

I know that everything in life will be a struggle so please don’t make some sarcastic comment, I already know it’ll get worse. And I’m already aware that some people have it worse but I guess I’m not as resilient as those people. I’m just posting this anyway because I wanna know that I’m not the only one feeling this way.

So considering this university’s reputation and how we’re all here, it probably sounds contradictory that I’d say something like this but I seriously hate studying and regurgitating info. Don’t get me wrong, I like learning but when I think about spending the next few years breaking everything down and dissecting every little thing for analysis and study, I honestly get kinda depressed and I’m barely a freshman. Like I’m sure there’s a lot to learn from the world but I think it would be much more fulfilling if it happened gradually instead of info getting crammed into my brain. So how do you guys do it? How do you motivate/discipline yourselves to get through college? I know many people motivate themselves because they want to escape an abusive household or fulfill their lifelong dreams but I feel aimless. I feel like I’m only in college because it’s the next step. I can’t even imagine what the future me would be doing. I personally find it hard to stay motivated and focused because my mind is always wandering. I know should be delaying gratification but it’s really hard not to binge watch YouTube videos or play online games when it feels like you’re not going to feel happy anytime soon. Additionally my brain feels like it’s literally rotting. My short-term memory has gotten so bad and I make so many mistakes that no one else seems to make. I don’t really have any solid plans to drop out or anything. It’s just that the idea of breaking every concept down while getting bombarded with deadlines, papers, tests, and then feeling like you’re not accomplishing enough is so depressing to me. To me it’s like always being conscious of your breathing, you know? If you live every second of your life worrying if you’re breathing correctly, like you’re some kind of machine, then. Every little thing has to be examined intensely. Again, I’m not expecting school systems to magically transform. I’m just looking for people who can relate."

Why would you encourage the student and continue this conversation going publicly? That is honestly so disrespectful to the professor who is teaching and doing their best to lecture and keep up with the chat for any questions. Now they got to decide whether to pay attention tot he chat or not. Most times they don't because of your stupid comments. On top of that every time you send a message of the chat it pops up and blocks the screen where the professor is showing their work. Even if you try to move the chat box to the side it doesn't fix the issue because it's now blocking the side work. I don't know if this happens because maybe it's a class of 1st/2nd years but come on guys, we're supposed to be mature adults.

I want a double major but I’m having a hard time deciding between Cog Sci (for a science background) or public affairs to go along with my poli sci degree. 

Public affairs seems like the right choice and I would probably do a minor in bioinformatics or brain &amp; behavioral health, but I know minors are kinda useless beyond talking points. 

Cog sci would give me the more sciencey background that I’m looking for, but it seems like it might be a lot of work to get done in two years, and it would likely be a total 180 from what I’ve been doing the past two years here. 

I’m also keeping law school open as an option but I’m trying to get my gpa up a bit for that (I’m only at about a 3.4something rn)

I had a moment of weakness due to the amount of stress I am dealing with and when I was taking my physics exam, I used chegg to answer 2 questions. My professor emailed me saying that these numbers were unique to my exam and cc’ed my physics 1 professor. He provided me with the links to the questions and asked me to explain how these ended up on chegg. 

I have never cheated before and I just really don’t know what to do. 

I’m not sure if this helps but the chegg account was not mine, it was another student’s account who doesn’t belong to that class."

Terence Tao is here which is a big plus but aside from that, I don't think UCLA will come close to competing with the big dogs as its endowment is far too small.

Your thoughts?"

But I think I fucked up majorly in one of my classes by self-plagiarizing on a research paper.

Basically, I had submitted another research paper/project in Fall and received an A on it. Fast forward to this Spring and a different class assigned a research paper with very similar prompts. I was taking 5 classes this quarter, dealing with my grandpa's death, and in CAPS for an ongoing mental health crisis. I thought I could just reuse my old research for this new project, but this was obviously very lazy and irresponsible of me.

I didn't just resubmit the same paper. I wrote an entirely new abstract, introduction, and analysis - but used the same research and data I gathered back in Fall. I rewrote and reframed many paragraphs within my body/discussion, and ""reworked"" the entire paper to be as ""new"" as possible...

....but now I see on Turnitin that my plagiarism report % is much higher than I was expecting. I included the data in charts and my survey in the appendix and tbh that's what fucked me the most. They are identical to my previous paper. The body of my paper is relatively new and original, but does contain many sentences that are fragmentally similar to my old paper.

I've never plagiarized before in my entire life - I didn't think that self-plagiarizing was really a thing, since it's my original research updated to fit this specific class. I included many new citations and analyses. ...but I feel absolutely ashamed, humiliated, and very, very angry with myself.

Does anyone know how fucked I am? Is this something that I can explain/justify, or is this a total violation of our academic integrity policies? I've never been in this situation before and I'm kinda freaking out. To everyone that is angry with me, believe me, I can't even live with myself rn."

A tip from someone who has been here for a while and lived in student housing and multiple apartments in the area. If you want your sanity intact after your stay here, do not rent with premier student housing! They really should be called shit housing for torturing unsuspecting students. I will tell you why. 

I moved into their levering avenue complex a few years ago. My first year there were some minor issues with the unit but nothing unbearable. I was rent controlled with them and I didn't need to worry about finding roommates, so it seemed great! Oh, except they don't vet roommates and it's a literal carousel of people in the summer. These people stay for a few weeks and often don't care about the space.  I thought, well, that's ok! It's still a good price and another year won't hurt. 

The next year I noticed a humidity issue that led to mold starting to crop up. We cleaned, we really did but it kept coming back. We would get them to fix leaks we noticed and that our neighbors noticed, but it never really went away. I was a frog being slowly boiled yall. I was not prepared for the nightmare that was my third year there. Also the management is horribly unprofessional. 

They started using a utility company that would charge us literally hundreds of dollars a month. Impossible amounts of utilities. Currently for the utilities we were required to pay for (water, gas, trash) I never pay over 100 dollars for a unit of a comparable size (honestly even that is more than I usually pay by a large margin....). They would send misspelled emails riddled with typos. Maintenance took forever even with emergency issues. The weird manager, who went by Nicole/Tasha depending on who was talking to her, accused of sabotaging showings. Showings she would schedule and then show up for on different days, or without warning. 

I regularly spent days without a working toilet in that apartment. We had our bathtub fill with sewage (our downstairs neighbors did too!) They said we complained too much because it took them 12 + hours to come and start fixing it. There were multiple instances of construction in our unit. It was disgusting. And it turns out that the mold and humidity were from a long standing leak that I'm pretty sure was from deep issues with old pipes. In short, that place is contaminated with mold for sure. 

Save your sanity. Their other buildings are also old and poorly managed. If you like sewage and rude people this is the place for you though! I got really good at plunging toilets and now I'm not phased by bodily fluids. 

Did I mention they don't vet roommates and I once had to clean up vomit to use my own toilet? Yeah. 

In short, fuck premier student housing. I hope their company fails 🥰"

p8nagj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/p8nagj/avoid_usc/,Avoid USC,27,10,2021-08-21 00:37:26,"Hello UCLA students! A tip from someone who has been here for a while and studied there and multiple universities in the area. If you want your sanity intact after your stay here, do not go to USC! They really should be called shit university for torturing unsuspecting students. I will tell you why.  
  
I studied into their school a few years ago. My first year there were some minor issues with the school but nothing unbearable. I was controlled with them and I didn't need to worry about finding classes, so it seemed great! Oh, except they don't vet students and it's a literal carousel of people in the summer. These people stay for a few weeks and often don't care about the space. I thought, well, that's ok! It's still a good price and another year won't hurt.  
  
The next year I noticed a humidity issue that led to mold starting to crop up. We cleaned, we really did but it kept coming back. We would get them to fix leaks we noticed and that our neighbors noticed, but it never really went away. I was a frog being slowly boiled yall. I was not prepared for the nightmare that was my third year there. Also the administration is horribly unprofessional.  
  
They started using an outside company that would charge us literally hundreds of dollars a month for tuition. Impossible amounts of tuition. Currently for the tuition we were required to pay for (water, gas, trash) I never pay over 100 dollars for a unit of a comparable size (honestly even that is more than I usually pay by a large margin....). They would send misspelled emails riddled with typos. Admin took forever even with emergency issues. The weird dean accused us of sabotaging showings. Showings she would schedule and then show up for on different days, or without warning.  
  
I regularly spent days without a working toilet in that school. We had our toilets fill with sewage (our downstairs neighbors did too!) They said we complained too much because it took them 12 + hours to come and start fixing it. There were multiple instances of construction in our school. It was disgusting. And it turns out that the mold and humidity were from a long standing leak that I'm pretty sure was from deep issues with old pipes. In short, that place is contaminated with mold for sure.  
  
Save your sanity. Their other buildings are also old and poorly managed. If you like sewage and rude people this is the place for you though! I got really good at plunging toilets and now I'm not phased by bodily fluids.  
  
Did I mention they don't vet students and I once had to clean up vomit to use my own toilet? Yeah.  
  
In short, fuck USC. I hope their school fails 🥰"

\- **P**lease get it in writing that whoever you're renting from will respect your wishes if they claim to do ""roommate matching!"" Because otherwise, hypothetically, the entity you're renting from might ""do their best"" when it comes to roommate matching and then not respect your preferences at all, sling you with people who don't match your lifestyle, which you only find out on your move-in day, causing you to have to drive all the way back home, change your apartment entirely, and then move back in the following day!

\- **S**pend time getting to know your roommates well! Because otherwise, hypothetically, you might room with them for months and never learn that they're a science major :(

\- **H**ave the initiative to email whoever you're renting from frequently if you need anything! Because otherwise, hypothetically, they might be out at Red Lobster and not see your emails until they get back!

\- **S**tay on top of communications with whoever you're renting from! Because otherwise, hypothetically, you might be operating on a misconception that the people you're renting from could have corrected at any time if they actually bothered to read your initial rental application in detail!

\- **U**se discretion if you have to pick between multiple options for an apartment to live in! Because otherwise, hypothetically, they might recommend you one place over another on the basis of *proximity to the pool*!

\- e**X**amine the actual apartment thoroughly, and not a model, even if you live several hours away from said apartment! Because otherwise, hypothetically, you might end up with cockroaches, falling window blinds, and broken microwave doors that fall off if you pull them too hard (read: at all)!

Hope you guys found these tips helpful, and hopefully none of you have to go through any of the completely totally hypothetical situations I provided :D"

Ashe is closed on the weekends and after 5pm on week days. So for all the things that we couldn't wait for the next day for (broken bones, severe stomach pain, mental health crises, alcohol poisoning, chest pains, etc) I've popped a squat in the Ronald Reagan ER for hours freezing my ass off waiting for my friend/myself to be seen.

Do I have a problem with the long wait time? No. Hospitals are busy. I totally understand how trauma cases go first. I don't care about that.

What do I care about? The fucking chairs in the emergency room. They're made of metal. They're slightly too too high to comfortably sit with my feet on the ground. My ass starts to go numb in about 20 min from the thin ass padding over the metal seat. The back support is at an angle that prevents sitting up properly or comfortably reclining, resulting in back pain.

The fucking chairs at Ronald Reagan turn the emergency room experience from being shitty to being torturous. Every person that goes in there is already in pain, and the goddamn chairs just make it so much worse.

Ronald Reagan is ranked as one of the best hospitals in the nation, I'd think they can find space in their budget to upgrade the chairs to not be actively painful to sit in. I'm not saying they need to put in La-Z-Boy recliners, but just replace them with something like whatever they have in airports. I've sat in airports for hours, and I've never had the thought ""wow this chair is actively hurting my body.""

Last time I was in the ER was a few weeks ago bc I had stomach pain that was preventing me from sleeping for 3 days. I went to teledoc, who told me to go to an urgent care. I went to urgent care, they told me to go to the ER. I went to the ER and sat there for 11 hours overnight. It was torturous. Not bc of the stomach pain or cold (nurses provided blankets, love them) or the limbo-like unending wait. It was god awful bc the goddamn chairs actively were actively attacking my ass and my spine. I've done my time there and I'm ready to demand slightly better chairs. 

This is my call to action. It's time to rise up and overthrow our metal chair overlords. I will not rest until my complaint is heard and noted. I am willing to request a duel with the person who designed those back destroying chairs. 

Tldr: the chairs in RR ER are not designed with the anatomy of the human body in mind and destroy my will to live. I will be filing a complaint with whoever is in charge of those goddamn chairs."

A little message to the 1st/2nd years,8,0,2021-09-22 22:49:01,"I just wanted to tell everyone that you deserve to be here and you are going to have a great time at UCLA learning stuff (or not) and growing as a person. (I personally recommend doing so by making friends with a diverse set of people with diverse interests and perspectives, but whatever floats your boat.) Whatever experience you have IS your college experience, the biggest mistake I made my first few years was thinking there was a certain mold of the ""college experience"" I was supposed to have when in reality it's basically just whatever you make it and there is no template. Whatever you do, just make sure you're doing it because you want to, not because you feel like you are obligated to or should (or peer pressured into it). And if you aren't having a good time, it's ok to leave.

Also plz be very cautious for your safety the first few weeks, as they are the most likely times that sexual assault occurs, due to people not knowing what consent even is, not knowing their limits (alcohol), etc. 

Also, if you're having a tough time mentally, CAPS is often a very slow resource due to it being underfunded, so there are a variety of other resources that may be faster. Going to the UCLA medical center is often faster than going to Ashe, the USAC IVP office has lots of resources, and for Black Bruins, there is the brand new Black Student Center with all sorts of resources. If it is a medical emergency, there are a number of hotlines on the back of your bruincard that DO come in handy."

ptm61b,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/ptm61b/anyone_living_in_the_apartments_have_a_bedbug/,Anyone living in the apartments have a bedbug problem??,4,1,2021-09-22 20:02:37,"Our apartment is currently dealing with a bedbug infestation, and I’m losing it. We’re pretty sure they were either already in the building or came in with some used furniture we bought from another student so I’d imagine that we’re not the only people in Westwood suffering from this right now. 

In any case, we’re about to prepare for our second chemical treatment on Monday so fingers crossed that it works. 🥲 

Anyway, a list of advice from someone who’s going through it right now: 
1. For anyone who’s interested in apartment-living, AVOID 655 Kelton. The building manager is a POS, and there’s a chance you might get a unit with bedbugs.
2. If you can make room in your budget for it, AVOID APARTMENTS WITH CARPET FLOORING. It makes the problem so much harder to deal with.
3. Similar to above, try not to take in used furniture if you can. If you do, examine it very carefully, ask the owner about bedbug history, try to see if they have bites on them, and then steam / clean it before you bring it in. 
4. WASH YOUR BED MATERIALS REGULARLY. Hot water, then dry it on high heat for at least 30 minutes. At least 1-2 a month.

For those who haven’t dealt with bedbugs before (like me until recently), I know it’s easy to read things like this and not take it seriously or think “it won’t happen to me” or “it’s probably not that bad”. BUT PLEASE PLEASE BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY THEY ARE THE WORST POSSIBLE BUG INFESTATIONS YOU CAN DEAL WITH. Dealing with them has been soul-draining, I don’t feel safe in my own bed, I can’t even go home for fear of spreading them to my family, I get bitten every night and get scars, it has such a major consequence on my mental health (partly because of lack of good sleep)— take these extra measures and invest a little bit of money now because in the long run, it’ll keep your life bedbug free, and that’s
priceless."

right now i’m living in ucla on campus 2 bed, 2 bath, 4 people apartments, but i have a medical condition called ulcerative colitis that messes with my colon and poop lmao

i’m living with 4 people and share 1 bathroom with someone and use the restroom a lot bc my disease makes me flare up, making me take FOREVER in the restroom and is so embarrassing because sometimes i shit bl**d. i feel so bad for my roommate but i also don’t wanna tell her about why i lag it in the restroom

i had this medical condition before freshman year, and asked tor a private restroom my first year dorming at ucla and even showed proof of medical condition to housing bc of my disease and got the private 2 person dorm. 

so i emailed housing about this. i asked if i can get a studio UCLA on campus apartment with no roommates just so i can have restroom/privacy for my medical condition, but wanted to ask y’all if y’all think it’d pass? i turned in a medical document from my doctor 2-3 years ago explaining that with my medical condition i need a private restroom and space so do y’all think that document has to be somewhere in UCLA’s disability or housing records or something? i’m literally back home and been crying since move in day (last friday) bc my medical condition makes it so hard to live with others and i really don’t want to disclose with to roommates about my medical condition because that’s so embarrassing and uncomfortable and i don’t think i have to tell them if i don’t want to because it’s my business?? so yeah

You can easily download your course schedule and save it to your personal calendar. Entries will contain time, location, CCLE link, professor name, final exam dates, etc. If you're a meticulous planner, this will save you a ton of time. If you don't plan at all, this will save you from yourself and help build better habits.

**Steps:**

1. Go to MyUCLA → Course Planner
2. At the top, choose &lt;current quarter/year&gt;
3. Scroll to the bottom, click ""View Full Study List""
4. On the right, click ""Download &lt;current quarter/year&gt; calendar data""
5. Save the file
6. Open in your calendar app

&amp;#x200B;

**Suggestions:**

1. Use whichever app is most convenient
2. Creating the habit is more important than choosing a calendar app
3. gCalendar and iCalendar are good starting points and both are free
4. Start and end your day by consulting your calendar
5. Create a 15 minute calendar event for all of your assignments
   1. Each event should start 15 minutes before the due date, and end *on* the due date
6. Use emojis to mark events like exams (⭐️), midterms (⭐⭐), finals (⭐⭐⭐), etc. 
7. Include professor and TA contact info in your calendar entries
8. Create a new calendar specifically for school so you can temporarily hide all other calendars for better focus

Hope this helps!"

I just wanted to make you all aware of the existence of the MyLA311 app and website, which allows you to put in service requests to City Services. 

I noticed that a lot of times the street lights in Westwood are off lately, which makes it feel rather unsafe to walk around at night. I have seen some people comment on that on here before as well. Having the streets in the area well-lit helps a lot to increase safety, so please contact 311 and report any streets where the street lights are off and you feel unsafe walking at night. 

They usually turn the lights on very quickly after submitting the request, sometimes within half an hour I've noticed. 

You can report any lights that are off here:

https://bsl.lacity.org/residents.html

Or, you can download the MyLA311 app and use that, or use the website.


Link to 311 website:

https://www.lacity.org/myla311

The app and website can also be used to report other issues (such as requesting pickup for bulky items/trash that have been left on the sidewalk, etc.)

Hope this helps! Go Bruins!"

Just a heads up to the new students about a black dude called Andre asking for money on campus for the homeless people. He is a scammer that's been on campus for many years. Usually, he would prey on people in front of the bruin store around the bruin bear; sometimes, he go down to the 405 entrance. 

The meme is that he has been scamming for a long time and still doing it. When they say ""legend,"" it is actually in a negative way.

Go straight forward and don't talk to him, he is not a nice guy, and when he gets the money, he would just keep them instead of donating to charity.

Please warn others about him instead of just memeing, and it is difficult for others to get the meme if they do not know the story.

Good luck and be careful on campus!"

So I have an idea for a club, and since I still don’t know many people here, I was hoping y’all could give me some advice. I want to start a new club where we get together as a group to kick back and listen to the new rap music that releases each week (at least 1-2 albums). I was thinking a good meeting time would be 9pm on Thursdays since that’s when the new music releases, but I was wondering, is that’s too late? I don’t think Fridays would work because I imagine most people probably have plans. Also, are there any good spots on campus (indoors or outdoors) where we can listen to music without bothering anybody with the noise/profanity? And I guess these are the two most crucial questions: 1) does this sound like a good idea and 2) does anyone want to join?!? I believe the deadline to register a new club is Friday so if anyone has any tips/advice on starting a new club please let me know! P.S.: Please message me if you’re interested in joining or taking on some sort of leadership role :)"

Hi everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

Due to the pandemic, the gaming industry is expanding quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

This is Marvin, and I have played League of Legends for 6 years and really enjoy this game and Kai'Sa is my favorite hero. At the same time, I am a Global Business graduate student and doing a survey about the “Gaming Companions”, which is targeted at University/College students.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are a gamer, it will only take about 3 minutes. Please help me by completing this short survey, otherwise, I will fail this class!

Thank you!"

Basically, I had repurposed my own research from the previous Fall quarter about a subject I was passionate about. I didn’t just copy &amp;amp; paste it - I expanded on my research, surveyed a larger sample pool, used new theories &amp; sources, and drew entirely new analyses &amp; conclusions.

I didn’t think what I did constituted as “self-plagiarism”, since my new research was twice the size and tbh twice the quality. I was proud of what I did and figured that this is the point of building our own portfolios of research at a research university. 

But obvi my professor didn’t think so lmao, and accused me of self-plagiarism. He gave me an “I/Incomplete” grade in the class and told me that the Student Conduct Office will be investigating this for disciplinary action. 

I explained my situation to them, and provided them copies of my Spring research paper and my previous research paper. This was MONTHS ago and neither party were responding to any of my emails.

WELL YA’LL!!!! after 7 months off crippling anxiety &amp; depression, struggling to stay motivated, and thinking that I’ll fail that class &amp;amp; get in trouble… The professor emailed me last night saying that “they accept my explanation” and my paper WAS NOT self-plagiarism, and my Incomplete grade has been replaced with an A+ 😭😭😭

TL;DR - I reused my own previous research in Spring quarter and was accused of self plagiarism, despite vast differences in content &amp; analyses. After receiving an Incomplete grade and being investigated for student conduct for 7 MONTHS, I was finally told yesterday that my paper was not plagiarism and I received an A+ in the class. God is indeed a woman bc MAN that shit sucked."
