Don't be the person who looks the other way when all of the doors are open to you, and proceeds to complain once you find yourself having squandered four years of possibilities and working a 9 to 5 job.

Find a balance between work and play. Better yet, turn your work INTO play.

5r4i4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/5r4i4b/moderator_message_politics_in_this_sub/,Moderator Message: Politics in this sub,58,9,2017-01-30 15:43:29,"Hi all,

Since the election, the moderators have noticed a pretty big uptick in the amount of political discussion that takes place in this sub. This isn't an issue in and of itself. The UC system is one of the largest public school systems in the country, and it is home to an incredibly diverse student body. There's a lot of political discussion to be had that is completely relevant to the students and faculty of this university.

""Relevant"" being the operative word.

Because what we're also seeing a lot of is the derailing of posts into bickering, name calling, and straight up hate speech at times. 

Thankfully, a lot of you guys are quick to use the report button, which is our biggest tool when it comes to weeding out irrelevant and vitriolic comments/posts. Though, it should be noted, we encourage you to report things for ban worthy offenses like ""incites violence"" or ""personal threats"", not ""this post is retarded"" or ""this person should go fuck themselves"".

Yes, those are reports we've received and no, they're not as rare as you'd think.

This subreddit is not a political soap box, and the mod team has reached the point that we are ready and willing to ban users who insist on using it as such. We're typically willing to issue warnings to someone who is just toeing the line for the first time, or we've received a single report on. But to those who persist in getting into political comment wars, or derailing previously relevant conversations with topics that belong in other subs, we will be handing out bans.

To be blunt, this is for the few people who keep pissing in the pool when everyone else is just trying to swim a few laps. The mods are tired of trying to clean up the piss, and everyone else is tired of swimming through it.

If you make alternate accounts to continue posting, we will be raising the issue to the admins (something we've unfortunately had to do with a number of accounts over the past few months.)

If you want to discuss the election or your thoughts on our current president: take it to /r/politics or any of the other dozen or so political subs.

Also, hate speech, threats of violence, racial slurs: all of these will result in an automatic ban. 

As I said before, there's going to be political discussions and posts that are related to UCSD and the UC system. This is not an attempt to discourage those discussions, and the majority of people on this sub are actually pretty good about keeping things civil and on track.

Moving forward, we encourage everyone to use the report button when they see comments or posts that break the guidelines I've mentioned here, or violate the rules of the sub and reddit as a whole. Feel free to send the mods a message if you feel we're not responding to your concerns, or you want to give us a heads up on a post that you feel falls into a gray area (we know those posts are going to happen, all we can do is deal with them as they come up).

And lastly, please follow the advice of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, and be excellent to each other.

The LCTs are a weekly event in which we meet to practice different languages. Every language has a table that is hosted generally by a native speaker so people can practice/learn that language. We have Chinese, Italian, French, Japanese, German, Spanish, etc. and even an English table for anyone that just wants to have a regular conversation. This takes place on Thursdays at 6pm in either the Great Hall or Asante rooms. I have been a host for more than a year and in that time it has gotten bigger and better and I believe we could make it even more so. It is a chill and fun experience and anyone is welcome to check it out. Students, non-students, faculty, everyone is welcome, so spread the word to anyone that could be interested. Come by tomorrow to Great Hall to check it out.

But now it's gone missing.  I'm the caretaker of the cache, and I'd hate for all that history to be lost.  If you or someone you know found it and didn't know what it was, and took it home or left it somewhere else or something, please bring it back or contact me.  It's no problem, accidents happen, and the cache has wandered off before, but it's always made its way back to where it belongs for future students to read.  I hope it does this time, too.

5sbcm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/5sbcm1/got_harassed_big_time_in_front_of_the_whole_foods/,"Got harassed big time in front of the Whole Foods at la jolla village square, just wanted to talk to someone about it.",81,24,2017-02-05 17:43:28,"I came out of whole foods with my groceries and this tall man who was working a legit donation booth (something for kids?) in front of the store walked right up to me and asked me to donate. I was already walking pretty quickly to the CVS next door as I was on a set schedule and politely declined. He told me to have a nice day darling, I said ""you too!"" and thought that was the end of it.

Minutes later I come out of CVS and realize I forgot to grab some forks, so I was back to Whole Foods when the man approached me again and said, ""You just bought something at CVS but you don't have any spare change?"" in the most demeaning tone ever.

WHAT???? WHO IS THIS GUY. I saw red, looked him straight in the eye and told him he can't be talking to me like that and not to test me. There's really no other excuse for the way he was interacting with me. He was a bully, period. I think he saw me as some innocent asian chick so he thought he could get away with it, but I was so pissed I was ready to square up. Thankfully he immediately backed off. 

I went inside and told an employee what happened. I really didn't know what else to do. They sounded really angry and went out to talk to him while I beelined straight towards my car. 

Here's what really confused me. As I enter my vehicle, I hear a guy yell ""YOU DRIVE A FUCKING BEEMER?"" I think, oh god, is he talking to me? I exited the lot, was driving on Nobel when this man weaves into traffic, drives his car up next to mine, screams fuck you and spits on my car. What's more confusing is that he's not even the same guy who approached me in front of Whole Foods. 

Can't a person just go to a goddamn whole foods and get some goddamn lunch and juice without being bombarded by these crazy hoes?????

* Muir is the best, but they all have their positives.  Except Revelle.

* Your college only affects where you live for a year or two and the classes you take freshman (maybe sophomore) year.  Don't worry about it so much.

* You don't need to be in Warren if you're an engineer and you don't need to be in Revelle if you're pre-med.  

* We don't know if you'll get off the waitlist.

* No, you can't switch colleges, unless you can prove that college affects your ability to graduate.

* It's not socially dead, everyone finds their group and has a great time.

* If you want to party you totally can, if you don't like parties you'll be just fine.  If you want a raging party school, go to state.

* CS is impacted, join Math/CS like everyone else.

* Greek life is small and not very traditional but very worth doing if you're interested.

* No one's forcing you to join greek life, if you don't want to then don't worry about it.

* No, you shouldn't start with a 5 class quarter.

* Taking 3 classes your first quarter to get used to the school is totally fine, unless you're an engineer.

* You're not allowed to bring a car first year.  Don't worry about it, you won't need it.

* You're going to have a good time if you come here.

The most common statement is usually to the effect of ""there's plenty of socializing, you just have to get out there"". Likewise, the usual complaint is ""if you're not an extroverted social butterfly, it's difficult to socialize"".

The end result is that both are true. UCSD is not a school that will make you extroverted; UCSD will not make friends for you, UCSD will (likely) not change your aptitude for networking for you, UCSD will not be a place where you hear about parties every weekend without your own efforts in the first place. 

I believe this is the most important distinction to be made. UCSD is not a party school, but plenty happens in the social atmosphere. If you're not naturally inclined to it, you're going to need to put a lot of effort into finding it.

If you are undeclared, admitted as Math - CS or waitlisted and deciding on trying to transfer into CS, here's an inside opinion to help you decide. 

from /u/chenboy3, the CS department is now making its admission based on a LOTTERY system. In previous years, it was based on a GPA cutoff of roughly 3.7 ~ 4.0 and last year 3.9 ~ 4.0. It was painfully hard to switch into CS as one A- could ruin your chances. One of these classes, 15L, was very likely to give you that A- since it was a lot of memorization that you're bound to miss somewhere. Yes, it was very likely for even you: who got straight A's in HS and 156% in all of your 23 AP classes. Thus, this lead to many people dropping CS class like a failed speedrun of a videogame and retaking them. Now this created a problem for other people who wanted to take those classes but had lower enrollment time. Thus, a fix proposed was a lottery system.

You may think to yourself, ""Ok, I didn't get into CS declared and don't want to try my luck in transferring, so let's do Math - CS."" Math - CS is NOT AN ENGINEERING OR PROGRAMMING MAJOR. It is a MATH MAJOR with emphasis on CS. A majority of the classes are MATH CLASSES. Yes, you take CS classes and yes you can succeed in CS as a career (I'm an example), but you need to understand what you're stepping into. Your degree consists of a lot of theoretical math classes that require you to write proofs and think abstractly, which is beyond what a lot of people are used to. I personally think that Math - CS is one of the **hardest** majors on campus to succeed in with people changing into Cog Sci (which is hard in its own right) to continue coding. **You would have to put up with *both* MATH classes and CSE classes at the same time.** IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO PUT UP WITH INTENSIVE MATH, DO NOT MAJOR IN MATH - CS. YOU ARE NOT THE EXCEPTION. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. 

There are options yes, but if you're accepted in CS elsewhere, I firmly believe that you should take that option instead of getting second tier status at UCSD. 

**tl;dr** If you got into CS elsewhere, take that option. Otherwise, be prepared to be stressed out.

So in advance, sorry for posting this. Mods feel free to remove if you feel it is redundant/unnecessary.

So I am a 3rd, almost 4th year here and have no friends :( not even acquantinces. I am a commuter and from the time I leave the house to the time I come home, I talk to no one. It is very pathetic. It's also pretty bad in terms of networking and stuff, but mostly I'm just soo so lonely and depressed. I used to be Greek but didn't feel close to anyone (felt the org was too ""fake"") and became an alcohlolic (recovered now) so I quit. Since then I have gotten a job and moved away from campus (2+ hrs each way by bus) and regret it so much. I only go to ucsd 3 days a week and work weekends. It's not really a hefty load, just far from campus. But i really want to make some friends before i graduate. I don't really have any established hobbies except I guess I like makeup and gaming but I am not very good at either. I'm also pretty terrible at talking to people but am trying to get better. 

Anyways aside from my sob story I guess my question is, what kind of clubs and orgs can I join without a significant time commitment? Preferably clubs that meet during the week would be great so I could go during gaps or something. I guess I'm looking for ""UCSD making friends on easy mode"". Are there any clubs designed for people to make friends? Are there any online groups besides here that are welcoming? I have been looking at the subgroups of triton gaming but I'm nervous since I suck at games. Does anyone have any experience from these? Are there discord channels I can join to get to know people? And, I guess in general if anyone has advice I would really appreciate it. Thank you to anyone who read through this, I know it is super lame.

 * APC: Petit Standard $55
 * Helmut Lang: Paint Splatter Denim $90
 * Alexander Wang $100+||
* **Ross** - LA Jolla’s discount store crapshoot which is either amazing or pathetic, depending on the day

**PACIFIC BEACH**

1. Buffalo Exchange (This description also serves for the Hillcrest location) - My personal favorite. Good atmosphere, selection of items, and more often than not a pretty unbelievable find. Prices are much, much higher than a normal thrift store, but far more reasonable than a consignment film. Be careful, however, as fake items from high end designers such as Givenchy and Visvim have been spotted here.
// **Average Finds** Ralph Lauren, Levi’s, Pendleton, H&amp;M, Forever21, Zara, Band Tees True Religion, Clark’s, Dr. Martens //

 * Stussy: Sorayama x Stussy Collab Tee $8
 * Richardson Mag: World Star Hip Hop Tee $27

2. Thrift Trader - Closed. RIP. Lots of music, but the clothing selection was lacking anyways

3. Goodwill - Smells terrible, pretty mediocre selection, but a good place for clothing if you are trying to make recycled or custom apparel
// *Average*: Levi’s, Dockers, Polo, Merona, etc. // 
Best Finds: Nothing notable yet

4. Cerebral Palsy Thrift Store - Unlike Goodwill, this thrift store has a relatively pleasant selection of vintage clothing
// *Average*: Disney, Warner Bros., Levis, etc. //

**HILLCREST**
 
* Buffalo and Thrift Trader same as PB, but shittier parking.

Well, they've figured out how to have the best of both worlds: Advertise their original lower prices, but **keep charging the new higher prices**! 

That's right: A few days later, they put out their old laminated price lists, and put up on their expensive menu-display TVs their old lower-priced menus. With such persuasion you could almost be forgiven for thinking they had gone back to their old prices. But no: Hundreds of us saps a day have been overcharged over the last few weeks. 

This new franchise has, in a remarkably short time since its opening, unforgivably violated the student trust. It's not enough at this point to just fix the menus (and I would be completely reconciled to higher prices - they have the quality and convenience to justify it). We should demand to the University Centers that Taco Villa also:

1. Refund the difference between advertised and charged prices to every credit card order
2. Donate the difference between advertised and charged prices for cash orders to a campus organization or event that benefits all students
3. Make their point-of-sale systems available to student representatives for periodic verification that they don't attempt to overcharge again. 

The only alternative that should be accepted is for Taco Villa to forfeit their lease. "

I also announced that my deadline to submit grades is Tuesday. Asking about the course graded before the grade deadline is like me asking for your programming submission before the assignment deadline. However much the question is asked, however much you want know the information, however much I want to know the information, when the information is still unknown, there is no answer to the question. I'm not in the situation where I know the answer to your question and am withholding it from you. 

Reading and responding to your question about the course grade breakdown before the information is known just causes the very information you seek to be delayed for everyone since I'm taking the time to respond to you instead of continuing with the analysis needed to determine the course grades. 

After being at the CSE 12 final exam until after 10pm on Friday night and after spending all day Saturday grading final exams until after 6pm, any questions about your course grades asked Saturday or Sunday show no consideration to me or to the course staff in allowing a day of rest or a reasonable amount of time to pass before expecting the course grade to be determined. You've waited more than 10 weeks to know your grade in this course. Can't you wait a few more days before demonstrating your impatience? 

As the student replier indicated, your question is worthy of a professionalism deduction. Knowing the answer to your question benefits no one, not even you. Knowing now doesn't change your grade, and it doesn't provide insights into the course content. Specifically, your question is an example of interactions to avoid such as ""asking questions where the information will eventually be known."" 

At the beginning of the course, we awarded you 100% for the professionalism portion of your course grade assuming that all interactions would be professional. Your interaction above indicates that our initial prediction of your professionalism was incorrect. I've made an adjustment in your score to reflect the error in our assumptions. 

If you'd like to explain how your question above demonstrates consideration, patience, and professionalism, please let me know."

6iwtp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/6iwtp9/a_turnaround_story_advice_to_future_students_who/,A Turnaround Story: Advice to Future Students Who Struggle Academically,109,19,2017-06-22 14:52:49,"I'm a transfer student who entered UCSD off the waitlist in 2015 as a biochemistry and cell biology major. I struggled a lot during my first year here, due to a combination of first time living away from home, research pressure, league addiction, and depression. I received academic probation in winter 2016 for 1.85 GPA and received subject to disqualification in spring 2016 for withdrawing every class except one where I took an F in. I was given absolute one last chance after they looked through my academic records. Stupid me who still couldn't figure out what went wrong took another F during the summer, but I was relieved that the last chance was for the fall quarter.

Starting from fall 2016, I started to figure out what went wrong and finally went back on track. Below is a list of advice that I am giving to future students who struggle like I did:

* First, figuring out what contributed to the bad grades is the most important thing. For me, it's mainly the research pressure (I hated research) and the league addiction (played league as an escape). Therefore, I quitted research and uninstalled league. What contributed to bad grades can include many things like being in a wrong major, working too much, relationship hardships, etc. Identify the issues then fix them will be the most important thing for the turnaround.

* Next important thing is the course selection. For me, all I took during winter and spring 2016 were my major classes. I didn't take any fun or easy classes and this makes my school days very dull and miserable. I started skipping classes and on the days that I attended I fell asleep within the first 10 minutes. 

* Here is what I did for the recent quarters that helped me tremendously. For each quarter:

1) Pick one easy class. This easy class should have a very high grade average (check CAPEs). Easy classes include some music classes like choir, Magagna, seminars in your major (194s for biology), etc. Easy class is important to build my own confidence.

2) Pick one class that I personally find very interesting. For me it's Japanese. I found Japanese language classes very interesting so I took one every quarter for my last 3 quarters.

3) Pick one to two major classes. Professors are very important. For biology, there are a lot of professor options for most of the major classes so check CAPEs, RMP, Reddit, and ask around to avoid the difficult and bad professors. Taking a bad professor can really kill my confidence to do well in all my other classes.

* Go to EVERY SINGLE CLASS. Go to professor's office hours and reach out to the professor or the IAs when you start encountering difficulties in the course. Although I didn't do it, you may also reach out to the tutoring centers, writing centers, or other campus resources for certain classes. 

* Find out and experiment what works the best for you for note-taking, and studying for exams. I experimented various note-taking and studying methods and I found out that for me, taking outline notes on a laptop worked the best. For studying for the exams, attending all the review sessions and studying 2-3 days before the exams while going over the test materials 2-3 times worked the best for me. 

* Lastly, motivation is temporary while discipline is like a muscle that you can train. Don't depend on the motivations to do well. Discipline yourself!

(I'll add more advice when I think of more.)

Because I finally figured out how to succeed academically, my grades did an 180-degree turn. I did very well fall 2016 and winter 2017 quarters so I challenged myself last quarter by taking 8 classes. I got 3 A+s and 5 As! Because I retook the Ds and Fs I am now graduating cum laude with a 3.8 GPA. [My Academic History](http://imgur.com/a/I1pDA)

I hope my story will encourage some of you and hope the list of advice helps. Good luck!"
6j57gh,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/6j57gh/for_those_facing_academic_disqualification/,For those facing academic disqualification...,81,5,2017-06-23 17:34:00,"
We've heard it all before. Go to lecture! Go to office hours! Start early! Form study groups!

So why do some of us continue to struggle academically? Of course we've heard that we should go to lecture. Of course we've heard that we should go to office hours. Of course we know we need better work ethic. We don't live under rocks. Perhaps, then, too often we focus on the ""how"" to succeed academically instead of ""why"" you should. From my experiences, if you find your purpose for doing well academically, you'll surely find a means to achieve it.

I'd like to begin with an unfortunate fact:

Not every one who goes to UCSD will graduate.

This is reality, harsh as it is. UC San Diego has standards to uphold and students who do not meet certain criteria will not be conferred a degree. I know the struggle--I've been there. 

In my fourth year, I became severely depressed, got into a relationship that made me feel even worse, contemplated suicide several times, failed numerous classes so I had to delay graduation, and was on and off CAPS for an entire year. Last summer I thought I had developed the right mindset and motivation. And yet I still did poorly last Fall and was Subject to Disqualification this past Winter quarter.

It is interesting how most of us in these situations always ask the same questions. Will I be able to continue at UCSD? What are my chances of being allowed back in? Can someone provide me reassurance that I will be okay?

From my experiences, these are the wrong questions for us to ask. Our circumstances aren't the problem--rather, they are the symptoms of the problem. I'm going to hazard a guess and suggest that neither your classes nor schedule are the issue so much as mindset and study habits. I know that's what UCSD believes, and because of that, you might get disqualified from UC San Diego. I know it's not what you want to hear, but you have to prepare for such an outcome.

But the real issue isn't getting kicked out of UCSD; in fact, an overwhelming majority of people who get the boot are able to get back in. If this is your first time being Subject to Disqualification, you will probably just get a stern warning. The real issue, however, is never developing good habits. The real issue is graduating without principles and work ethic. The real issue is leaving without the conviction that one will succeed in life. Some people graduate in 4 years without a hitch, yet work minimum wage jobs for years. Others flunk out, develop some character, come back to finish strong, and either end up making big impact on those around them or land jobs with lofty salaries.

So maybe do some soul searching in the coming weeks and months. Ask yourself why you are here at UCSD. Talk to people who have never received a college degree and see how they live their lives. Meet people who had to fight tooth and nail for the privilege of going to college. Look around for work and understand that most require a Bachelor's degree. Perhaps try working at several entry level jobs and realize that many managerial positions are unattainable without a college degree. Envision yourself without a college degree and see how many doors to opportunity become closed. Find out why you want a degree from UC San Diego.

When you find your purpose for going to school, only then can you truly focus on how to do well. I'm not the best at ""school"" so I can't give you advice on how to get a 4.0, but I do believe that finding your reason for going to school and building good habits will allow you to at least graduate. Realize that just because you struggled in college doesn't mean you will struggle at life. I've come to terms with the fact that I'm not the best at homeworks, exams, and projects, but I see attaining a college degree as a necessary step on the stairwell to greater aspirations: financial independence, making impact on those around you, freedom to pursue passions and hobbies.

So to summarize: Don't worry about getting kicked out of school as much as living an unfulfilling life. Ask yourself where you want to be a year from now. What concrete actions must you need to take to make your vision a reality? Now pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and go accomplish them."

Just recently graduated college and I've been meaning to do a foodie guide for incoming freshmen and current students. I've lived off campus from sophomore onwards so when I don't cook I normally eat at La Jolla Village Square (Chipotle woohoo) or on campus and spend real cash. I will go over the food in the dining halls in the end as I also have strong opinions on what to get and what not to get.  
Please take note that these are my opinions only so don't get hostile if I talk shit about a restaurant you like.  
I will first be going over the restaurants at Price Center (at least the one I've gotten a chance to dine)
  
  
**Price Center**  
**Tapioca Express** - Get any of the snowbubble, Strawberry Banana was my fave. In general their drinks are great. I like the curry pork chop quite a lot, the first three combo gets boring after a while. If you're an international chinese student and feel nostalgic, go for the Pork Ribs, it will sort of remind you have home.. TapEx is a good place to eat often.  7/10

**Santorini's Greek Island Grill** - Throughout the 4 years here, I've only gotten a few dishes. My go to lunch/dinner is the Santorini Island Fries. It's basically a meatlover + fries and some other sauce I can't name. If you don't like the sauce like I do, you can just tell him to not add it. Otherwise it's great if you're a fries kind of person like I am. They also have good salad. They are probably also the best for breakfast. You don't have to wait in the normal line, you can get breakfast as long as it is before 12 pm. The omelette is the best imo, enough to fill you up for sure, I'm kind of sad I only picked up on that in my last quarter but oh well. shout out to the nice hispanic ladies behind the counter hard at work everyday! 8/10

**Burger King** - We all know what this is. The person behind the counter seems to feel like ass everyday so it kind of takes away the experience. My go to is the 2 for 5. But really I don't really eat there that much compared to the others. I only eat at BK when there's too much of a line in other places in Price Center. Also, I'm pretty sure they don't use good ingredients cuz everytime I eat there, my stomach hurts like hell (my friend feels the same way too). Their fries are dope though. Diarrhea/10

**Bombay Coast** - According to my numerous indian friends, this place isn't authentic. I'm really not surprised, just like how Panda Express+Tapex isn't authentic Chinese food, Bombay Coast is probably to fit the taste of the majority. It has a pretty strong taste. My favorite combination is combo 1 with Sweet Honey Chicken + Chicken Tikka Masala + Chicken Masala. Those are the best out of all the options. If you're into the naan, you can order the garlic naan. Beware though, it's poorly made and takes forever to make. I've only had it once and I hated it. (waste of $2.75) 6/10  
  
**Panda Express** - lol not authentic chinese food as mentioned above.  I don't really have a favorite I just get whatever my stomach is craving that day. But know that you have the option to ask a mix of rice and noodles. The fortune cookies taste great idk why. I only eat here when I'm out of option and am sick of other restaurant at the moment. 6/10
  
**Rubios** - Another Chain Restaurant. Takes forever to get food out. the Taco Tuesday special is pretty good. Anything with shrimp is okay too. Don't get the nachos and cheese, they fuck it up 2 out of 2 times they made it for me.  I only eat Rubio in La Jolla Village Square since it has a nicer environment. I really like the cali bowl with any kind of meat. Given the good environment for the off campus chain, I give this a solid 6.5/10
  
**Subway** - Just order whatever, they are cheap given the amount they give. Did you know you can get meatballs? 6/10  
  
**Jamba Juice** - This place is Great. I initially didn't really like it because I had the Strawberry Surfrider which was super sour and I had a headache that night. But after I gave it another try it was so good. Definitely a good place to go to when you are in need of a drink to relieve stress. Their acai bowl is delicious too if you're into that.  Bomb/10
  
**Lemon Grass** - This place used to be a stand in farmer's market (an event that happened every tuesday each week every quarter from 10 am - 2pm I might do another foodie guide if this one gets good feedback) But I guess by popular demand they made a permanent spot in Price Center. Back when it was a stand, the line was almost as long as the people lining up for the career fair (which you should go btw) and what annoyed me was the rice to meat to zucchini portion. Like what the fuck why do I have so much rice when I have so little meat to go with it??!?!?? The meats are decent the zucchini are often times overcooked and the rice taste like ass. 5/10.  
  
**Round Table Pizza** - Only had it once, the pizza was kinda oily, also pretty overpriced. I don't think a lot of people go there, it's usually for frat/sorority gathering anyways? 4/10  
  
**Shogun** - Since I'm Asian, I eat here quite often. The taste hits right in the sweet spot. You can eat anything there as long as it has chicken katsu in it. Boy they make the best chicken katsu. If you're also a fan of the chicken katsu like me, then you can do 1) curry bowl with double chicken katsu 2)double chicken katsu bowl. Make sure to also come on the right day to get the special deal of the day. I personally can't care less, but the small soda is pretty nice. Their chicken steak (?) is really good too, sometimes they run out since it's pretty popular. As for the noodle section, I think it's unhealthy and very few are even good. They just dump instant noodle in there and add a few sauce. For the price you pay, you're better off just buying the ingredients and making them yourself.  9/10 (katsu TOO good)  
  
**Yoghurt World** - I've really only had it like 3 times in total in 4 years since I'm not a fan of sweet stuff. If someone would like to add an opinion I will replace this line of text. too few to rate.  
  
**Croutons** - This is a sandwich shop? I think their location is kinda bad as many students don't even know of it's existence. They are also really expensive. 3/10
  
Moving on to places worthy of mentioning in colleges.  
  
**The Bistro at The Strand** - This place is not cheap but it's also not bad. If you're ever stressing out because you've got a date but all the restaurants off campus are booked, then this place is for you (note that you also need to book here to be guaranteed a spot, gets busy during night) Everything on the menu is worthy a shot. As a person who only came here less than ten times, the only problem with this place is it is annoying to get there unless you live in the village or ERC.  8/10
 
**Home Plate** - BEST BURGERS ON CAMPUS is their slogan. Well if the only competition is BK and dining hall burgers, then obviously. But really though, I don't find their burgers that special, nothing really impressionable. Wait time is a bit long, the fries are yuck and also a hassle to reach.  Only been there a couple of a time. They have TVs so you can take your mind off the food while watching some sport lol. 4/10

**Hi-Thai** - They are decent. Given a variety of food on the menu, I'm surprised they manage to come up with so many of my favorite dishes. The Mi Quang Egg Dried Noodles probably offers the best taste of all things. When I declare that, you have to keep in mind that I have tried almost every dish on the menu. The BBQ Pork Noodles/Thai Fried Rice come in a close second (this was my freshmen favorite). Everything else is worth a shot, their chicken skewers weren't that bad either but so is everything else. The guy that owns this restaurant is the nicest dude I've seen, good to banter with. 9/10  

**Incredi-Bowls** - Only had this in my freshmen year since finding it when I'm off campus is kind of tedious. They offer a variety of stuff each day, I'm not sure how they work anymore since they were in revelle when 64 was still under construction. But all in all, a good place to fill up your stomach. Sometimes you might need two bowls to actually fill full, but that's just me.

**Sixty Four North** - meh. Their chicken is ok. The steak is a hit or a miss. their dessert only has one that is actually decent. It also feels like a place you can take a date to, but the food just is subpar you wouldn't wanna get dumped because of this. 5/10  

I have only had Taco Villa once since it only opened in my last year and I already had rubios and chipotle for my mexican food need so i will not give it a rating. It is for you to try out if they are good or not.  
  
Last but not least the Dining Hall food! As a freshmen I'm sure you're required to buy dining dollars. One of two things would happen: you either run out of dining dollars you end up with too much because dining hall food on campus sucks ass. In order of tastiness for the 6 colleges, I would rate: Muir &gt; Revelle = Warren = Sixth &gt; ERC &gt;Marshall (nonexistent?)  
Pines has really good breakfast, I like their scrambled eggs and tater tots quite a bit. Besides that I really don't have much to say since it's been 3 years and a lot has changed during those three years. I've heard people of their own college usually hates their own dining hall. I think it's pretty funny since food quality is honestly pretty bad and also really expensive. I am honestly glad I moved out so I don't have to spend money on crappy food. That is all guys I hope you enjoyed my foodie guide.

Prelude: in U.S., there are many ranking systems for universities but the one that is used as the defacto is the U.S. News National University Ranking. When I started school in 2012 - the same year that Khosla became chancellor - UC San Diego was the 3rd best UC on the U.S. National University Rankings. This year, we are the 6th behind Santa Barbara, Irvine and Davis. And, while yes we sit higher in the U.S. News Global University Rankings, that list does not hold the same weight that the national rankings do. 

As a new graduate, I am sincerely upset that our school's name is being tarnished. We all have paid tens of thousands (even hundreds of thousands) of dollars to have degrees from a prestigious university. But, Khosla has focused our money on expanding the university at a pace that can't keep up, by lowering the acceptance standards and cramming our classrooms. [We accept 34% of students who apply, and have 37.7% of our classes are larger than 50 people.](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/ucsd-1317/applying) These two metrics make up for a lot of our overall ranking, and it's easy to see why we are falling if you compare our statistics to Berkeley which has [15% acceptance rate and only 15.8% classes larger than 50 people.](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/uc-berkeley-1312/applying)

I don't know what we, as a community, can do to stop these policies, but I sincerely believe that this will affect how employers and post-baccalourate schools will see our school's name on our degree.  "

&gt; what should I do in college that will help me get into a top grad school?

Letters of recommendation and research experience are crucial, nothing else really matters. Having actual published papers (first author or major contributions) or invited presentations is a cherry on top, it's rare for undergrads to have any, so don't worry about this too much. For many top PhD programs, simply having 4 worth of research experience with supporting letters of rec is sufficient to make you a running candidate, even if you don't have any great results.

&gt; I have Regents, so I get some research opportunities from the first quarter.

The best advice I have given that I know nothing about you, is to use your initial research opportunities to get good recommendations to open up future research opportunities and internships, and to learn and explore as widely as you can. There's an enormous variety of research out there, and it's very normal to completely switch your research focus several times, but as with many things in life, the sooner you can settle down, commit to a direction, and really push, the farther ahead you'll be than many many people.

A necessary side effect of learning and exploring widely is feeling like you aren't progressing anywhere. You will certainly be bored during some times and very frustrated at other times. Don't let this discourage you, it's part of the process.

&gt; How important are internships?

I recommend internships for general growth and experience. Crucially, you will eventually have to make the important decision between industry and academia, and it's wise to inform yourself of both sides as much as possible. There's no better way than internships to understand what working in industry is like, with regards to aspects ranging from how companies manage team projects to the lifestyle. Similarly, there's no better way to understand the academic world than doing research full-time during at least one summer.

CS internships can also help you quickly learn new skills. Through CS internships, I really honed the ability to build, scale, and maintain software projects, which has just been useful far more broadly than the actual meat of my undergrad CS internship work.

&gt; How do I get to know my professors really well without it being awkward?

The largest source of variance here is simply your professor's personality. But the basics will never hurt - being prepared and putting an honest effort whenever presenting or discussing your work with your professor, being polite and humble, etc.

&gt; How do I do valuable research, rather than being just another burden for professors?

The definition of valuable research that professors and grad students use is research that is publishable, and interesting enough to others to have a decent impact. From the perspective of professors and grad students, the primary thing that undergrads are useful for is essentially menial labor. Consider yourself fortunate that you're not in biology where this would confine you to being a wet lab slave for the majority of your undergrad years.

In CS, depending on your particular field of interest, it might be possible to provide expertise on interesting things like using particular tools, programming languages, etc. The key thing to capitalize on is that quality research at a bare minimum takes a lot of time that grad students and professors don't necessarily have amidst all their other responsibilities, as well as a confluence of expertise and insights from a large variety of perspectives. Grad students usually won't be as willing to learn new things as you will be, instead relying on skills they're bringing to UCSD from their undergrad years. These are opportunities to contribute to valuable research while also satisfying your interests: learning new things and making valuable contributions for good letters of rec."

6vkvrj,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/6vkvrj/fyi_to_graduating_seniors_start_applying_now/,"FYI to graduating seniors, start applying now",36,11,2017-08-23 11:17:53,"I know this applies to almost all STEM majors, but I'm sure it does to non-STEM too. Bigger companies that have entry-level engineer/accountant/developer/chemist/management/etc. positions start posting their class of 2018 jobs right about now. The companies will generally interview in Sept/Oct/Nov and send out offers in Nov/Dec/Jan. I know this from experience. Additionally, drug testing usually occurs right around an offer letter so be prepared for that before like early December/January to relieve your own stress.

**Why are companies posting now?**

Well, mainly because this is when semester systems start. Companies budget to recruit at this time every year, for travel expenses, hours for employees, etc. Also, it's better to secure positions early on than wait to the last minute and administrative stuff takes a while on the company side.

**Where do I go to find these jobs?** 

1. Google: ""[Company name] careers""

2. Either:

a. Go to search jobs and query ""entry-level engineer/accounting/chemistry/etc."" A lot of times the entry-level positions are leadership development/engineering development/sales development/whatever titles and the qualifications will say ""Graduate with a B.S/B.A in whatever by June 2018.""

OR

b. Find a tab that says ""University Recruiting"" or something similar on the careers page, it'll usually link to the job title.

As one for an example, that I know for sure already has some posted, google ""Nestle Purina careers."" 

**But why should I be applying to these jobs right now?**

Because it's better to get an offer early on than wait until the last minute. Companies are more prone to hire early than later, it is just a better investment of their time. You can accept an offer in December and rescind it if you get a better one later on, that's business (I did it twice last year, no problems for me whatsoever).

**Why are you writing this u/NotTheBizness?**

It seemed like a lot of people in my graduating class did NOT know when to apply. Lots were scrambling toward the end of the year with the realization that they'd missed lots of opportunity by dragging their feet. Three of the four people in my senior design group did not have an offer by the end of the year, I don't know if it was just my group or not but that was concerning to me. I'm just trying to spread some knowledge and hopefully alleviate some stress for your future selves.

Ask me questions if you want, I've applied to a shit ton of jobs but I'm no expert on resumes. I can always take a look though.

Also: internships get posted a bit later, usually, but it doesn't hurt to start looking now."

I got a little curious, so I went there and bought a sandwich and vermicelli noodle (pretty good...). The order was around $20, and I didn't tip since it was a takeout order. 

The next month my credit card statement comes, and there's a charge for $60! Wow. If i were gonna rip someone off like this, I'd be at least a little more sneaky about it...not overcharge freakin' $40...

So I called in, and told them about the situation, and almost immediately the woman on the phone apologies. Her apology seemed very rehearsed...Anyways she decides to refund me the FULL $60 (probably to get me to shut up and not report this to anyone), so I got my banh mi + vermicelli meal for FREE! :-D

Then the other night I got hungry again, and I felt lazy to cook at home, so I decide to try this trick again. I ate at the restaurant, and asked for the check once I was finished with my meal. After the guy took my card and charged it, they only left me the store receipt - NO CUSTOMER RECEIPT!! SOOOO SHADY!

Anyways, I'm looking forward to another free meal once they charge my card for more than what I left them (I took a picture of the receipt with the exact tip I left). 

So yeah, just wanted to share with any hungry students - if you want a free meal, check out Pho La Jolla! It's about walking distance from campus. Just make sure to take a picture of the receipt, and check your card statements at the end of the month. :-)

6vldqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/6vldqp/enrollment_faq/,ENROLLMENT FAQ,28,63,2017-08-23 12:30:52,"I'm so annoyed at all the posts on this sub right now so here's a quick FAQ about enrollment.

&gt; **Will X class open up more seats???**

If it's a lower div class probably yeah. Upper div classes are unlikely. However I'm pretty sure that most of the seats are released already.

&gt; **Will I get into X class if I'm # on the waitlist?**

Use the 10% rule. If the section has 50 people total, then the first 5 people on the waitlist are really likely to get in. If the class is a writing class (WCWP, MMW, etc) or Magagna class then ignore the 10% rule and it's more likely a meteor will hit Earth.

If it's a CS class with a low total number of seats, then yes if you're a CS-related major because the dept prioritizes them. If not then it's less likely.

&gt; **How is X teacher for Y class?**

[CAPES](http://www.cape.ucsd.edu/) has data on professor evals. [RateMyProfessor](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/) has what people think about so and so professor and their opinions. The [planner helper extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/planner-helper/omoljdnncdeeglgmagijlamhjlagobep?hl=en) by J Delany is great and shows you data straight onto webreg and includes past grade distribution data (ie how many people got an A, B, C, etc). If it's a professor that is new this year you're out of luck. We also have the *reddit search bar* and the [2021 facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1854106464870965/?fref=nf) is also really helpful and also has a *search bar!*

&gt; **Is this schedule doable??**

You should probably stick to 12-16 units this quarter. If you're concerned about the difficulty of freshmen seminars they really aren't hard at all.

If you're taking STEM classes, try not to have more than 3 STEM subjects. For additional reference some people would say that certain writing classes such as WCWP tend to be a lot of work.

If you're concerned about distances, use Google maps or [UCSD's map tool](http://act.ucsd.edu/maps/) where you can literally just slap two buildings down and it will give you an approximate walking distance and assumes you have a *really* leisurely pace.

If you're concerned about how your schedule is structured (8ams, 3 classes in a row, having all classes on X day etc) this is dependent on your *personal preference*. If you like waking up early, go ahead and slap on some 8 AMs (however some people who think that usually start adjusting to a schedule where they wake up later and begin to regret it). If you like having days where you can screw around and do nothing, sure, stack all your classes on MWF and leave TTh mostly free. If you wanna get your classes over with, go ahead and do 3 classes in a row, but be considerate on when breakfast and lunch is and when you get hungry. You can go eat in the lecture halls though, nobody really cares, just don't be a pig about it.

Also, please be aware that certain classes require concurrent enrollment with other classes, like certain language classes have tutorials that you have to enroll in.

&gt; **Will I get into my planned schedule if my enrollment is at X day at X:XX?**

If it's today, probably. If it's tomorrow after noon, make a lot of back up schedules and think of a lot of back up classes. You probably might not get your first choice in section. Consider also that certain sections with convenient times will be a lot more popular than 8 AMs or 6 PMs for example.

Some of you may have seen my post promoting an org called Color of Healing on the UCSD Class of 2021 Facebook group page. The original club had long disbanded in 2015. My interest in art therapy had led me to the graduate founding board members, and now my friends and I would like to revive the organization again and keep it running into the future!

We're searching for principle members who are interested in making a change in people's lives. COH was well loved among residents in nursing homes and patients in Thornton Hospital, and volunteers, either on an individual or group basis, used to share various art techniques such as origami/watercolor/etc. But what patients and the elderly cherished most was the interactions with the members who showed a genuine interest in their lives. The club was even expected to expand its influence into the cancer sectors, but couldn't due to a variety of issues. We're looking to come back stronger and harder than ever and find like-minded people who would join us in our mission! 

If you're interested, please PM me. [We have an application, :)] Thank you very much for your interest and consideration!"

I just want to wish everyone luck with the fall quarter starting up! I'm starting up my last year here at UCSD. Anyways, I've been seeing a large influx of CHEM 6ABC posts here and decided to post up a few tips for doing well.      

 For some background, back in high school, I got a 2 on my AP Chem exam. I was fully dreading taking the 6 series, because I knew that I was going to do horrible. I'll tell you now that the chem classes here are a lot different from high school. They will make you work, but they'll give you a lot more academic maturity than any other class here. Fast forward to now, I'm now working on finishing a minor in Chem, and I teach Chemistry at OASIS.     

Chem 6 with any professor will make you study, and is probably most challenging during 6B. So if you're starting 6A, it's really important that you start your foundations strong! I guarantee that you need to look over the textbook for this class. Yes, your professor will go over the types of problems that you'll encounter. Yes, your sapling homework will make you practice your math work. But, what the book has step by step descriptions on how to do a problem.      

There's lot of resources on campus if you need them too! You have the CHEM Help Rooms which runs in the evening. The schedule doesn't seem to be updated yet: https://www-chem.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/helproom.html

 and you also have OASIS Chem workshops if you need extra help! Do not worry about selecting a workshop that is the same as your professor. All the professors have the same curriculum, so, everyone is learning the same thing! You can sign up here: https://students.ucsd.edu/sponsor/oasis/ Anyways, good luck with your quarters, everyone!! I believe in you!

It was fun being on the other side since I'm usually the one talking to employers. But from talking to like 100 of you I've compiled some tips, I'll probably repost this before the next fair but it should help you for tomorrow's as well:

**STEP -1: The Resume**

Put the important stuff in large font so I can quickly glance at your job history &amp; education. I don't want to have to scan a wall of text.

**STEP 0: The Outfit**

I don't really care what you're wearing. Your resume, personality, and enthusiasm for the company are 100x more important than wearing a suit. Also, if you wear a suit, you might get all sweaty or look uncomfortable, and that's way worse than owning a shorts-and-sandals look. Really just wear something comfortable that makes you feel confident.

**STEP 1: The Handshake**

Look, this is simple. Just give a firm, casual handshake. Some people have weird handshakes and that can actually throw me off. Don't just dangle your hand there. But don't focus too much on it either. Some people I could tell had been rehearsing a ""Business Handshake"" and looked like they were thinking like ""OK, strong grip, here we go, three shakes, one, two..."". Like, just be casual about it. You can hand me your resume now, later, whatever.

**STEP 2: The Introduction**

State your name, let the recruiter state his, say ""nice to meet you"". Maybe compliment his company shirt or something to break the ice. Then, most importantly, state your degree (if applicable) and what type of position you're interested in. Here's a template:

*""Hi, I'm Bob, nice to meet you. I'm a [Junior / PhD Student / Alumni] in [CS / Math / Animal Husbandry] looking for an [internship / full time / part time] job starting in [Summer 2018].""*

Because before you start telling me about how great your squirrel classification research is, I want to start to get a sense of where you'd fit within the company so I can start considering you for that role. We don't just hire people because they're cool, we hire them for certain positions. 

**STEP 3: The Position**

Now give me a summary of your background. Basically your personal statement. Say, *""I have a strong background in small mammal care and I'm interested in joining a fast-paced team doing gerbil milking and rat tickling.""*

Now I've probably got a position in mind for you. This is great, because now everything you say and every question you ask I can think of in the context of that position.

**Step 4: The Company**

Ok, maybe you've done some research into my company, but I don't know that. If you show up and start pitching yourself but you haven't shown interest in my company or what it does, I'll think you're just desperate for any job you can find. Instead, either ask me about the company (if you don't know) or state something that's interesting about it. For example: *""I think the advances your company has made in Hedgehog de-spining are incredible.""*

Bam, now you've established that you did your research and you think the company is cool. That's a powerful sentence.

**Step 5: Read the Audience**

Ok, so you've memorized this 3 minute speech about how great you are and you're dying to recite it. But you have to think about who you're talking to. My nametag has my position on it, use it! If I'm an HR person, give me some sparkly buzzwords and a brief overview of your job history. If I'm a software engineer, bust out some computery knowledge, talk about specific technologies. 

**Step 6: The Mini Interview**

BRIEFLY tell me about a project or job experience related to what my company does and the position you want. If my eyes light up or I indicate I'm interested in it, keep talking. If not, mention something else. It won't help you to keep talking after I've lost interest. 

**Step 7: Ask Questions (or don't)**

Look, if it doesn't seem like we like you or you like us, swipe left. I won't be disappointed if you cut your losses and go to apply somewhere else. But if we're vibing, take some interest in my work and my company. Ask about what I work on or my company's tech stack and comment on it. Have a normal conversation. 

**Step 8: Bye**

Now don't just kind of linger around awkwardly after the conversation comes to a natural conclusion. Say something like, *""Well I'm glad I came by, it was great to meet you. Your company sounds awesome and I look forward to hearing from you.""*

**Basic tips that sadly need to be said** 

* Don't check your phone while I'm talking to you! I'm amazed at how many people did this. Look me in the eye or at our booth / brochures. Maybe I'm boring you, but don't act like it!

* Don't assume you're already hired. This sounds obvious, but if you start asking end-game questions like ""Can I drink soda at my desk? How many stock options will I get?"" I'm like WTF we're probably not gonna hire you anyway bud.

* Don't diss our technology. Maybe negging works for you to get dates. Who knows. Don't do it to a company. If you think something's off you can phrase it as a question about our tech choices or competitors.

That's all I got for now, hope it's helpful. Feel free to AMA."

After relaying this info to my roommate, she contacted the Housing Office to confirm if we were being moved into dorms, which turns out to be true...

The woman at HDH stated that our housing contracts and information regarding temporary housing was left ""exceptionally vague"" and we were never guaranteed to live at The Village, although emails suggested otherwise. When confronted about why the freshmen currently living in The Village aren't being relocated into dorms instead, my roommate was informed that to move them out and move us in is ""double the work"" for the University. 

It turns out, West Mesa is being relocated first into open spaces in dorms, with North Mesa relocating last. Although fliers on our doors on move-in day said Mesa demolition was to occur in December, the HDH rep said demolition was not occurring until March. Residents of North Mesa are to be moved out by April. 

Although I am pleased to continue to live in North Mesa until April, I am extremely frustrated at the lack of transparency with HDH. Their misinformation, ""vagueness,"" and lack of communication is disappointing. Since this information isn't being presented to residents of the greater Mesa community, I decided to take it upon myself to keep everyone informed. Feel free to contact HDH with your concerns. "

I received a letter today telling me that after my administrative appeal, their decision was upheld and I was still out $65.

This summer, I purchased a Summer Session 2 parking permit. Grades are due for SS2 on 9/13, so my class had its last assignment due on 9/12, which was the Tuesday after instruction ended for SS2.

I parked on campus on 9/11 with my SS2 permit to work on my SS2 class. It never crossed my mind that I would need to spend $20 for a temporary permit to park for the day, because I'm at school working on a class for the period that my parking permit is named after: Summer Session 2. 

I received a ticket for $65 because apparently SS2 permits expired the previous Friday, when instruction ended. 

I went online to check if they expected us to have already purchased a Fall permit by that Monday, and nope. Fall permits weren't on sale until 9/15/17, four days after I received the citation.

By their logic, I was supposed to pay $2 for every hour I spent on campus from Monday 9/11/17, until Friday 9/15/17, because they arbitrarily decided to make the SS2 permits expire 4 days before grades were due.

This is fucking ridiculous. I was sure they would see how absurd this is and grant my initial appeal. Nope.

So I requested an administrative hearing and met with an arbitrator and explained the situation to her. I was so sure she would overturn the fine when I explained and showed her the printed out school schedule--highlighting when grades were due, when the permits were available for sale, and the fact that there was a 4 day period where I needed to be on campus, but couldn't because they didn't have any permits for sale.... 

NOPE. They're fucking us. How can they not see how insane it is to be fining students who are just trying to get assignments done and don't have the money to be paying for fucking temporary parking permits when my permit is labeled SUMMER SESSION 2 and that's what I was fucking working on.

Last night (Saturday), at around 8:30pm, I walked to the end of the dirt Gliderport parking lot from the Village to destress from studying. It's normally a pretty good walk, as it's right along the ocean and you can see the stars fairly well. I went around a small gate at the end and was just leaning on a fence post for a few minutes. At this point, there were very few cars in the lot, none passing up and down, and I assumed most of the ones there were empty. It was pitch black as there are no lights down the length of the lot. I didn't see a single other person the entire way down. I was startled when the door of the car directly next to the fence opened. An older guy and about 5'5"" and wearing a black hoody came out and started to walk towards me. I ignored him at first, and thought maybe he'd walk farther down. 

He stopped directly in front of me. He started asking me how I was doing, what I was doing there, etc, and although I thought it was pretty strange, I didn't want to be biased based off his appearance. He started getting really creepy. His hands were in his jacket the entire time. I said I was just trying to relax from studying, and he responded with ""Yeah, we all need to relax... just realllyyy relax, it's goood to relax sometimes."" He had been getting closer to me, and at this point was about an arms reach away, and he complimented my jacket, saying it looked really good. At this point I said I needed to leave to go back to study, and walked away. 

After about a minute of walking in darkness down the lot, I turned around, and realized that he might've been tailing me. His headlights were off, and he was going exactly my walking speed and about 50m behind me. I started walking faster, and he stayed the same distance behind me. I pretended to be on the phone, and stuck to the far left where there was a fence I could jump and parking lot signs so he wouldn't be able to get too close to me with his car if he tried. At the end of the parking lot, where there's a bit of a chokepoint, I stopped to let him pass. As he passed by, he slowed down, stared at me, saw me on the phone, and turned on his headlights and drove off. 

Just for the record, I'm a guy. When he was talking to me, I was consciously deciding that if he looked like he was pulling something from his jacket, I would grab his wrists and could overpower him since he was smaller. Although it was hopefully unlikely, if he decided to pull a weapon on me while I was walking away, I'd still be fucked. The only reason I didn't call the police when I saw him tailing me in his car was that I knew he hadn't done anything illegal yet.

If someone else finds themselves in a situation like I was, PLEASE call 911 - if you don't feel safe, you don't need to wait for a crime to be committed to reach an operator, something that I was dumb enough to not realize in the moment. 

The guy was about 5'5"", in his 60's, had white / whitening hair, Caucasian, wearing a black hoodie, and driving maybe a 2014 Prius. "

As a matter of principle, I'm against paying students to complete their CAPE reviews.  I consider the extra credit award, even so small, as such a payment.  It's not earned, it's not merit, and so I'm not comfortable with the idea.  I don't agree when other instructors give students grade benefits in exchange for their reviews.  It took a lot of convincing from the tutoring staff for me to agree to implement such a suggestion to increase CAPE participation.  I thought of the two extra credit points not as points themselves, but rather I thought they represented the same as allowing all students one extra week to complete one lab for full credit.  The amount of points is insignificant, and in looking for any way possible to increase the CAPE participation, I agreed thinking it could only help.
 
The first thought at increasing CAPE participation was to include a CAPE link in the last lab, but that link was omitted, and its absence wasn't noted until after 2/3 of students had been checked off.
 
The next thought, which I thought was a really good one, was to give all students specific time in class to complete their CAPE review.  This would be very much like how CAPE was administered when I was a student.  Since Tuesday was a quiz day when everyone was present, that would be ideal.  This is Fall quarter, and for some students new to UCSD, they don't know what CAPE is, and so I could introduce CAPE and its importance.  This seemed perfect, and we'd get 100% participation, and we could move on.  That's what we did.  I saw everyone pull out their phone and their computer.  They were silent for the 5 minutes we spent on this.  When I saw that most people put their phones and computers away, I thought most were done, I thanked everyone genuinely, and administered the quiz.  Later, when I checked CAPE participation, I was shocked to see that the review rate was still about 50%.  My request was simple, short, important to me, important to the CSE department, important for future students, and I was disappointed and puzzled by the results.  When working the class, I am 100% focused on students, their project and hopes for their futures.  I expected that in return for my dedication to your futures, you'd dedicate 5 minutes to my future.
 
Due to the surprising result after witnessing everyone seemingly complete their reviews, I was back into the position I was earlier of looking for ways to improve CAPE participation.  When the entire tutoring staff insisted that most other instructors have this practice, without other options presented, I thought, let's see if it makes a difference.
 
In general, I believe in free will with regard to CAPE reviews.  In most past quarters, I don't even mention it.  You get the emails.  You should give the evaluations.  I believe that some students don't know how much the faculty is evaluated based on the reviews.  In my last CSE 110 class in Winter 2017, the students gave a lengthy applause at the end of the course which I appreciated.  However, the CAPE reviews were the lowest I've had in any CSE 110 class.  When I asked a few students about it, they said, ""oh, you always get good reviews, and so I didn't bother submitting one.""  The CAPE review participation rate became newly important to me due to being formally evaluated by students who only have strong views rather than from the class as a whole.
 
Now you know a little bit more about the motivations behind my surprising actions of trying any way I could or any way the tutors could to increase CAPE review participation.  Including the review as part of the last lab check off really seems to be the best way to raise participation.  If you have a better solution, please let me know.
 
Thank you for your words stating your opinion.  Thanks for mentioning professionalism in your response.  Being professional is a real aspect of being successful as you move onward into industry, and so I am pleased that you are paying attention to an important yet easy to overlook aspect to building a positive future career.
 
Being professional, I shouldn't have to ask that students complete their CAPE review.  Thinking about its purpose, every student should feel obligated to complete the review as a way for their voice to be heard and to improve education for those students in future courses.  If that wasn't enough, then my request to complete the review should be enough because it's so easy and quick.  If that wasn't enough, I made time in class for that specific task and watched all students with my own eyes performing this task.  However, that wasn't enough either.
 
Unfortunately, it's a sad situation."

sorry for the rant but it's finals week, we're all going a little crazy. my suitemate also decided to play overwatch all night and scream over the headset, and I got to hop aboard the all nighter train with him because of these paper thin walls. i'm not really angry but more impressed at the fact that he can do that shit non-stop from 10pm-8am.

Going into college, I knew that my high school friends would go to different schools and drift away as interests start to divert from things like AP classes and what not.  Thus, I was really optimistic that the friendships I made in college would be close and last a lifetime. I've heard stories from my older friends that them and their current group of close friends ""go way back to those college days."" Unfortunately, I haven't been able to see that for myself. I've joined clubs, studied with people, and even hung out, but people end up doing what they need to do to succeed and our conversations end on the surface level.

I personally feel like the people I've met and befriended have been cool and interesting, but at the end of the day - after we get our degrees and pursue our careers, we'll just remember the struggle and move on with our lives.

I’ve never seen starvation marketed as a feature. 

Aside from Goodies, OVT, and 64 (which is probably named after the time it takes for you to get your burger), pretty much NO food is worth its dining dollars in real money. $8.75 gets you a dry piece of chicken breast, 6 broccolis, and a few bits of clumpy rice at Cafe V. 

Food is actually remarkably fundamental to living; I’ve even found eating is something I do a few times every day. That, along with housing and education, is pretty much all a student needs to do the studenting. So why is the food here so bad for the price point? Where does the money go?

I, on the other hand, am really uncertain and kind of scared about my life after college, honestly dont really have a clue what I want to do.

can anyone relate? it would really make me feel better to hear your thoughts, cause honestly sometimes I feel like the only kid in this school who feels this way.

Way to go! So... before you all go and ask the same questions that are asked every year, I'm going to try to answer them here.

Muir is the best, but they all have their positives. Except Revelle.

Your college only affects where you live for a year or two and the classes you take freshman (maybe sophomore) year. Don't worry about it so much.

You don't need to be in Warren if you're an engineer and you don't need to be in Revelle if you're pre-med.

We don't know if you'll get off the waitlist.

No, you can't switch colleges, unless you can prove that college affects your ability to graduate.

It's not socially dead, everyone finds their group and has a great time.

If you want to party you totally can, if you don't like parties you'll be just fine. If you want a raging party school, go to state.

CS is impacted, join Math/CS like everyone else.

Greek life is small and not very traditional but very worth doing if you're interested.

No one's forcing you to join greek life, if you don't want to then don't worry about it.

No, you shouldn't start with a 5 class quarter.

Taking 3 classes your first quarter to get used to the school is totally fine.  If you're an engineer you may want to reconsider.

You're not allowed to bring a car first year. Don't worry about it, you won't need it.

You're going to have a good time if you come here.

Edit: For everyone I’ve freaked out because you got into Revelle, relax it’s not that big of a deal. "

I just had my last midterm this week, and I'm pretty sure I am close to failing the whole course. I've just been feeling very overwhelmed with everything lately. The thing is, I don't think I have much on my plate (job, one org, and classes like every other student) compared to the majority of the students on campus who seem to excel in their classes whilst also juggling so many other things. At this point, I'm not even sure if it's my time management, my study habits, a partial dislike for certain STEM classes, lack of motivation, or a combination of all of them. 

I just wanted to get this off my chest anonymously because I've been feeling really lonely as well and don't want to bother my roommates/friends about my current despairs. If you've ever felt this way (or not), please feel free to chime in for encouragement or mutual suffering (though I ultimately hope it's not that :)) Overall, I'm still going to try my best and am hopeful for finals week because I don't got time for all this

If you got into CS, you're in and don't sweat it.

First of all congrats on making it into UCSD! If you are undeclared, admitted as Math - CS or waitlisted and deciding on trying to transfer into CS, here's an insider's opinion to help you decide.

The CS department is now making its admission based on a LOTTERY system. In previous years, it was based on a GPA cutoff of roughly 3.7 ~ 4.0 and last year 3.9 ~ 4.0. It was painfully hard to switch into CS as one A- could ruin your chances. One of these classes, 15L, was very likely to give you that A- since it was a lot of memorization that you're bound to miss somewhere. Yes, it was very likely for even you: who got straight A's in HS and 156% in all of your 23 AP classes, president of 43 different clubs, two time WWE champion, etc. Thus, this lead to many people dropping CS class like a failed speedrun of a videogame and retaking them. Now this created a problem for other people who wanted to take those classes but had lower enrollment time. Thus, a fix proposed was a lottery system.

You may think to yourself, ""Ok, I didn't get into CS declared and don't want to try my luck in transferring, so let's do Math - CS."" Math - CS is NOT AN ENGINEERING OR PROGRAMMING MAJOR. It is a MATH MAJOR with emphasis on CS. A majority of the classes are **MATH CLASSES.** Yes, you take core necessary CS classes and yes you can succeed in CS as a career, but you need to understand what you're stepping into. Your degree consists of a lot of theoretical math classes that require you to write proofs and think abstractly, which is beyond what a lot of people are used to. I personally think that Math - CS is one of the **hardest** majors on campus to succeed in with people changing into Cog Sci (which is hard in its own right) to continue coding. You would have to put up with both MATH classes and CSE classes at the same time. **Additionally, it is now a capped major with a GPA cutoff of at least 3.4.** This means that every quarter you do not apply into the major, **the cap will be going up (to put this into perspective: it went from 2.6 a year ago, to 3.4 this quarter).** Consider the fact that you have to work extra hard in these math classes to get into a major that is **not** strictly programming oriented. Furthermore, you have **zero** priority for CSE classes meaning there will be quarters where you will **not** get into CSE classes.

Cog Sci is a different story, pm me if you have any questions as I am minoring in it. 

IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO PUT UP WITH INTENSIVE MATH, DO NOT MAJOR IN MATH - CS. YOU ARE NOT THE EXCEPTION. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

There are options yes, but if you're accepted in CS elsewhere, I firmly believe that you should take that option instead of getting second tier status at UCSD.

**tl;dr** If you got into CS elsewhere, take that option. Otherwise, be prepared to be stressed out."

My gpa took a dip after those chem, bio and math classes freshman and sophomore year fucked up my gpa and has been under 3.0 since that. With how slowly my gpa has been rising I’ll have to accept that I’ll never reach 3.5 cumulative since I’m not a freshman or sophomore anymore and I probably don’t have enough time to raise it up by that much :/."

I myself expected constant friend hangouts from college. I didn’t get that (because my friends are always studying), but I do have a good group of friends and an amazing club for socializing.

We all know their ""healthy"" options are glorified salads with little variety. So how do we prove to UCSD that healthy changes are more than welcome and actually desirable? Run a test. 

We take on franchises in PC with limited contracts. If we bring on a healthy company to take up property (potentially Round Table Pizza?) on our campus and they receive a good response, it could be an example of how what we choose to spend our money on isn't just the calorically dense, instantly gratifying meals we can access. 

I'm not talking about point-blank healthy places like tender greens where the only option is a salad. I'm talking grills with fresh foods, I'm talking acai bowls, I'm talking your favorite niche avocado toast store. What I am trying to do is bring in a company that prioritizes good ingredients, no additives, and a clear mission to provide foods that are good for both your palate and your body.


I’ve taken the initiative to look up a few places, but these aren’t the only options.

UFood Grill
This is a place who takes pride in never frying their foods, always baking and grilling their meals, and a strictly limits servings to only contain a MAXIMUM 700 calories and 950g of sodium per serving. Buy whatever you want and don’t worry about it.

Rush Bowl
Everybody loves breakfast. However, there seems to be an abundance of waffles, eggs, bacon, and other fried or buttery options for the morning. How about a place that specializes in acai bowls? One with pure and healthy fruits and veggies being the main ingredients, I don’t know where you could go wrong. Also a good place for all the struggling vegans on campus to grab a bite!

The Poke Company
This company keeps all of their foods and fish freshly sourced and never frozen. It keeps ingredients pure and unaltered, ready to be built in front of you. The best way to know what goes into your meals is watching it get constructed and having a voice in it. And honestly, who doesn’t like poke?


These are just a few options UCSD can explore. We need to make a stand for everybody who doesn’t want to be forced to buy junk foods all the time. We need options for every person on campus and let people choose what goes into their bodies. And maybe seeing the campus preference change towards healthy businesses combined with more pressure on HDH could even lead to better dining halls with food that we can rely on and never worry about.


TL;DR - Pushing for a health food franchise to be put on campus and putting pressure on HDH to follow the example of the potentially successful business model.

(If you haven't SIRed yet, it's a good read).",167,42,2018-04-29 19:46:54,"Obviously there are people here who are social. Almost 30 thousand people come here and you're likely to find the people you click with if you try. The stuff you read around that ""it's what you make of it"" and ""you're the owner of your fun"" is correct.

But that's just brushing a lot of stuff under the rug. It's the opinion of the whole UCSD staff that **UCSD is not a party school**. Period. You're not here to party, you're here to study.

La Jolla is not a college town. There is no place nearby where you can easily meet students in a open environment with a chill vibe. UC Davis would be a complete opposite environment. Besides the frat rows, just about any restaurant, tea house, or environment there is filled with students. Your bus driver is likely in one of your classes. It's just an environment where it's **hard not to socialize**, when people that go to your school is everywhere both inside campus and outside. If you're an introvert seeking to change, this type of environment is your best bet.

Many colleges are like this. UCSD is not. No matter how hard people try to brush it off, there is nothing close to this environment in La Jolla. If you're out in downtown SD, you're on your own in the big city, meeting strangers who may or may not go to UCSD and this uni is even tougher if you're introverts who want to stop being one.

The administration and staff are quite open in that they want you to work hard. If they see you have time to party then they're doing something wrong. They get most of their money from research grants, so if they're gonna waste their time teaching students, they're going to be inconsistent in quality (some do care and work hard, others don't give a fuck and just want to make you miserable since you're pretty much costing them money). Regardless, it's going to be tough, and they, in general, won't give a fuck.

It's a research school, focused school, and not a party school. Besides all those geographical hindrances, UCSD's administration will not make it easy for you to make friends in any possible way of the imagination. Making friends and finding your own group at other universities is a walk in the park when there are so many places that students gather for fun, while here it's like you're thrown into the forest to fend for yourself. It demands action. You join a frat, a club, and hope for the best as those are very much required to find your own group of friends here.

It doesn't have to be this way. Universites like this are not the norm. Students that tell you otherwise likely have never been or seen other university campuses.

I'm not denying anything that has been said before, by the way, it's true you can find friends when you put effort, but don't try to make it sound like this environment is normal, or that it's the same for other Unis. I've studied in other unis, and I guarantee you if you spent one summer in UC Davis you would agree with me that this is not the norm.

This is your mentality if you're coming to UCSD:
**I want a good degree and start my career ASAP, anything else is consequential and a plus**

If you don't have this mentality, or if you want to focus on having fun/college experience while working on a degree, you're not a fit for this school, and the administration does not want you here."

I've been at UCSD for the better part of a decade, and I think my tenure is finally close to over. I figured I'd finally post one of the things I've been wanting to post, to help people get acquainted with the UCSD area.

#Resources

[UCSD Maplink](http://act.ucsd.edu/maps/) - If you haven't taken the time to look at this at all, this is a great place to learn where your classes are and where resources (computer labs, student orgs, dining, etc) are located. For anybody who's been at UCSD for a year+ and is looking for somewhere, this map probably has everything you need, and more. There is also [a different version](https://maps.ucsd.edu/mapping/viewer/default.htm) that I think is older, and it doesn't work as well in my head, but you might like it better.

[UCSD ""current"" map](https://m.ucsd.edu/maps/current?no_server_init) - A resource you may have found with Google. If you're looking here, in my opinion, you may as well just go to [Google maps](https://www.google.com/maps) or [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org). There is also another [UCSD map](https://maps.ucsd.edu/map/default.htm) that is interactive, with tons of detail. Works great, but it has so much info that I doubt it's mobile friendly? I may be wrong. 

[UCSD campus map PDF](http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/PollutionPrevention/GreenChemistryInitiative/upload/UCSD-Campus-Map.pdf) - A bit outdated, but useful for driving in general. However, there's currently a lot of construction going on, so if you're driving, you should probably just use and trust your GPS of choice.

[Campus tour](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1c187y/official_new_student_qa_2013/c9gn7ih/) - A comment made by /u/IGiveProTips 5 years ago, which mostly still holds true today. Also has bathroom ratings which I personally agree with. Highly recommend you read part or all of this post if you're new or new-ish to the school.

[Things to do](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/12kkco/things_to_do_around_ucsd/) - An old reddit post with many people chiming in things to do around the area. 

Places to eat [#1](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/887b4f/what_are_your_favorite_places_to_eat_off_campus/) and [#2](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/2pto3v/favorite_places_to_eat_around_ucsd/) - If you're looking for food options, use the search bar. This post is NOT the post for you. Meanwhile, you can try dining hall posts [#1](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/7bbair/best_bang_for_your_buck_dining_dollar/) and [#2, chicken tender edition.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/82m75g/which_dining_hall_has_the_best_chicken_tenders/)

[""Michael Kelly""](http://campusmap.michaelkelly.org/map) - When I first got to campus, and was looking for a map resource, this is what everybody was telling me to use. Even back then, it was outdated, and it's still outdated. It literally says ""data from 2005."" I have a nostalgic attachment to it, but I don't recommend it.

#General location

If you're in-state, there's a good chance you don't need to read any of this section at all (unless you want to correct me!)

UCSD is located in southern California, [seen here](https://i.imgur.com/kllGsG9.png). In this view, you can see other cities hosting UC schools, such as Santa Barbara, Irvine, Los Angeles, and Riverside. The approximate location of UCSD is circled. You may notice it is very close to multiple freeways, and it is also close to the ocean, being in the Northwestern area of the city of San Diego. 

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/l6v8jat.png) we have a closer view, showing the cities surrounding San Diego. You'll notice Tijuana, Mexico, is not very far. I know students who go there to visit, for food, or for whatever. If you plan to do this, clearly, you'll want to bring your passport. To the north you can see Carlsbad and Oceanside. Way on the northeast, I've included a city called ""Julian"" which I've never visited, but which I've come to understand is known for its pie. 

[A look at UCSD within San Diego.](https://i.imgur.com/L9oibO8.png) While you're attending UCSD, there's a 99.9% chance you'll be living within the boundaries shown here. Up in the north and northeast there is Carmel Valley and Mira Mesa. UCSD is right on the 5. The area between the 5, 805, and 52 is sometimes referred to as ""The Golden Triangle"" and more often referred to as ""University City."" This is where a large amount of off-campus housing is, but it is also home to tons of other people. UCSD itself is in an area called ""Torrey Pines"" just north of ""La Jolla."" La Jolla and Torrey Pines are both great places to visit that are easily accessible, depending on what you want to do. Along the coast, going south, there are many beaches, all the way down to Coronado Island. All of these beaches have great weather, great places to eat, and I've seen people surfing/surfed myself at all of these locations. South of University City there is an area called Clairemont, home of Convoy, which has tons of restaurants and places to eat. South of that is Linda Vista, and south of Linda Vista, you get to Hillcrest, Balboa (Park) and Downtown. I have friends who commute daily from Linda Vista, Hillcrest, Mira Mesa, and downtown, many through bus and shuttle. The public transportation here isn't A+, but it's definitely enough to get by, if you'd rather get housing outside of the area close to the school. Also, if you get a bus pass (free with tuition, currently), you can visit literally every place I've mentioned for free, granted some places take longer than others to get to, so maybe you'd rather get a lift.

#UTC Area

Moving in closer to campus, [we can see](https://i.imgur.com/xbzBpzb.png) where you will realistically interact with if you are a UCSD student without a car. [Here is an artist's rendering](https://i.imgur.com/fHlgdey.png) of where campus would be on that map. Realistically, you can think of campus when you're looking on a map as bordered to the west by N Torrey Pines Rd, to the north and east by Genessee  Ave, and to the south by La Jolla Village Drive. This includes some off campus locations and removes some on campus locations, but that is the general area of campus. For undergraduate students, you can realistically only focus on areas west of the 5. 

You may notice a green patch in University City between Governor and Nobel Drive. This green patch is Rose Canyon, and if you live north of there, within UTC, your commute to campus will be shorter. I've had friends who lived close to each other, but across the canyon, where the one on the south side has double the commute. I imagine it depends on the day and access to a car.

Way on the east side, by Mira Mesa, you see ""MCAS Miramar,"" also known as ""the base."" There are many ""the base""s in San Diego. If you are on campus, and you hear large vehicles in the air, there's a good chance that's where they're coming from. 

Also, I figure this is a good time to point out that UCSD, where you are going to be studying, is not touching the ocean. If you're not at Scripps, you are not studying next to the ocean. [This](https://i.imgur.com/kMFLyKq.png) is a lie. However, the ocean is accessible by shuttle, foot, car, and bus, so there's no excuse to never go there. You can see the ocean from a large part of western campus as well. 

The discoloration labeled ""Westfield UTC"" is also known as ""UTC mall"" (and is sometimes just called ""UTC""). This is a pretty nice outdoor mall. A similarly-colored discoloration labeled ""La Jolla Village"" is where most students who do not have dining dollars go shopping. You can look more into that yourself.

#UCSD

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/5q1VsQ6.png) is UCSD as seen by Google maps. If you are an undergraduate student, for the most part, you can ignore everything south and east of Gilman (including the interstate). To the east of Geisel (library), you can ignore anything north of Voigt (unless you're in Warren College). Depending on your location in campus, you can ignore large chunks of it. For example, everybody except for ERC students can ignore the northwest. Even a [map of the colleges](https://i.imgur.com/0NKvejX.png) from [UCSD itself](http://provost.ucsd.edu/colleges/compare.html) shows how stupidly out of the way ERC is. If you were forced to live in the college you chose, ERC and Revelle would clearly be the furthest away from most things...but that's not always how it works.

You'll note in the most recent map Rimac Arena, which is one of many gyms on campus, but it is the one I've seen the most people go to. It's huge and has fantastic facilities. The area labeled ""bookstore"" is Price Center (PC), with all the food and restaurants. There is also a place there where you can get ripped off when buying school supplies/books/merchandise. Surrounding the library/PC area, there are some lecture halls. Surrounding those, you will find most of the dorms, and most of the dining halls. So if you're studying in the library and living off dining dollars, good luck (I think Goody's is the closest, but maybe that was my burrito bias back when I used dining dollars). Most lecture halls aren't *too* far from each other (10 minute walk or less usually), but good luck if you get one of the far ones (RIP York to Pepper Canyon walks). 

[Here](http://physicalplanning.ucsd.edu/projects/map.html) is a 2016-2017 map showing construction projects still under way, so to the person reading this 10 years from now, sorry everything is so different from how I described.

#Summary

I wanted to make this post because there are [SO MANY MAPS](http://i.imgur.com/9WQ3nz3.jpg) out there, that are awful simply because they are so outdated. I wanted to make it because I've heard people on campus talking about living off campus with so many misunderstandings as to what's around us. I wanted to make it because I needed something like this when I got here, and I couldn't find it. And now here it is, probably inaccurate, but it's the best I've got. 

I was looking for a map that shows the separation between the colleges better, because I know there are some out there, but really it doesn't matter. If you want to get to know campus more, go [check out the Stuart collection](http://stuartcollection.ucsd.edu/map/) or something like that. Lots of good stuff to see there."

Each question that would require a normal person days to fully digest, Gary with an omniscient voice would answer back correctly after several moments of thought. 

As a Teacher’s Assistant of Gary, I watched him masterfully delegate tasks to twenty of his Assistants during midterm and final grading. Grading 200+ tests uniformly not only to the current quarter but past quarters as well and keeping moral high during one day marathons of grading is no easy task. Gary organized this so well, former tutors would show up and join the fun. 

The best part about Gary is his group mentality. Gary often thinks of what is best for the group as a whole rather than what is best for him. I have witnessed him in many situations where doing the right thing and doing what was best for him did not aligned and in every situation he always chose what was right.

I look up to Gary as a former student, a former teacher’s assistant but most of all as a human."

For the question:  ""When is the midterm exam,"" was an electronic search performed first before asking electronically?

 

- The midterm day and time were announced in class on the first day.

- The midterm day and time are listed in the course slides for the first day of class.  Those slides are available on Piazza.

- The interactive Google calendar for CSE 15L has the midterm exams scheduled.

- The midterm day and time are listed on the course calendar page:

--------------------------------

Midterm:

Wed, May 16th, 2018, 2:00pm-2:50pm in PCYNH 106 Section: C00
Wed, May 16th, 2018, 3:00pm-3:50pm in PCYNH 106 Section: A00
Wed, May 16th, 2018, 4:00pm-4:50pm in PCYNH 106 Section: B00
.--------------------------------

 

The midterm exam is a significant event in the class, and therefore, the student asking this question should have correctly assumed that the information is available on the course website especially since it's information every enrolled student needs to know.  The professionalism deduction here is to set an expectation that a student should search for such information first before asking others.

 

The professionalism deduction here is also to acknowledge that a member of the course staff shouldn't be spending time to respond to a question that can be answered so easily by simply looking around.

 

UCSD students are incredibly bright, talented, resourceful, capable (and can be described by many other positive adjectives).  Am I wrong to expect every student to be able to easily determine the date for a midterm exam for a course in which they are enrolled when that information was announced in multiple ways?  I feel a responsibility to call out a student who isn't able to find such information independently.  I do so to raise the expectations of what they should have for themselves for their own capabilities.

 

Learning about professionalism can be frustrating.  Those most frustrated about it seem to be the ones that understand it the least.  To be the catalyst to get student's attention beyond my classroom to engage on this topic shows me that I've hit a nerve.  (The student asking about the professionalism deduction in this post completed CSE 15L in Winter 2016 and only joined the CSE 15L Piazza forum to spark this discussion on professionalism.)  To get students talking about professionalism as a topic they care about is amazing.

 

I feel relevant to bring professionalism to students before they experience the downsides of professionalism when they enter the workforce when it matters the most.  As I travel through my career, I'm always willing to tell students of the professionalism deductions I get and what difference it makes or doesn't make.  It's never fun to be corrected, but sometimes, these are some of the most valuable lessons we learn.  Learning about professionalism can change perspective and can cause us to strategize before we engage with others when the outcome of an interaction is most meaningful.

 

In closing, my intents of raising awareness of professionalism are multiple:

1.  To reduce the time students, my staff and I spend on issues that don't have an effect on a student's future, on a student's learning or on a student's final course grade.

2.  To acknowledge that professionalism is essential to master as you enter professional life because professionalism deductions are real.  They cause you to be discounted and excluded, the opposite of what you want to experience in your career.

3.  To get students to think about what really is important in their education.  When one or two points here or there don't make a difference in their course grade, why should anyone spend any time on those one or two points?  Learning the lessons those points represent definitely matters.

 

I hope students learn the difference between what is and what isn't a professional interaction.  I hope when they consider engaging in professional interactions, they do so without worry.  I hope that knowing that they are acting professionally increases the confidence in their interactions.  I'm glad students see professionalism as an important life skill, and that being more professional means being more successful.  If I can help students better figure it out, let's talk."

Posted that about 2, maybe 3yrs ago. Two/three years later, I’ve had my share of even more shittiness, but also some sunshine. I guess that’s what you call life. 

I ended up completing 2yrs at Ucsd then taking a gap yr then transferring bc of personal, extenuating reasons. 

Within that time, I’ve actively considered suicide (headed for the Golden Gate Bridge, tried ODing on pills etc), been beaten for 14 hours and been beaten to the point of losing hearing in my ear for almost 2 weeks and getting bruises that lasted me a month, felt extremely hopeless since I wasn’t going to school or working, felt hunger and I mean actual fucking hunger, and I’m currently struggling with having the financial means to be able to go back to school rn (I’m so damn close to getting my fucking degree). 

Within that time, I also tried counseling at Ucsd caps and at a hospital closer to home and with a psychiatrist near home (home is the Central Valley for me), and met some really good people (dated one and he was quite a gem although we broke up quite recently), learned some new scripts in languages that I was previously only able to speak but wasn’t able to read or write in, finally found a major that I felt passionate about and understood, and started cooking a lot more, and I learned to meditate, and I found a religion that gave me peace, and connected more with my cultural roots. 

My original post was made after I completed my first year at Ucsd. Inevitably, your first yr at Ucsd is going to have some struggles. Best things to do that helped even a loser like me?

Find a job. Even if it’s in the dining halls. Makes you feel productive and helps you set a schedule because you have to go to work at the time that you’re scheduled for.

Find a gym buddy and hit RIMAC a few times in the week. Also find a trustworthy friend to go on occasional night walks with (Ucsd is pretty nice at night tbh, be safe though). 

Join orgs. My favorites were the Buddhist Club and DVC. 

Study outside of your room. Seriously makes a difference. And try studying with a study buddy. 

Go to CAPS. I had some shitty experiences with CAPS and SARC, but the counselors are actually very well-meaning. Especially if you find someone you click with. I used to see Dr. Roberto Luna in warren. He was honestly great and I’d highly recommend him to anyone. He helped connect me with so many resources on campus too and he also had me attend CAPS mindfulness workshops. The workshops were alright, but I did end up meeting a very golden person at one of the workshops who later ended up becoming a very dear friend of mine. 

And make use of as many resources offered by Ucsd as you can. You pay for them and they’re there for you and they actually can be helpful. Like OASIS tutoring and CAPS and the career services center and so forth. 

Ucsd might seem like shit and depressing af while you’re there. But trust me, once you leave, you can’t shake off the memories that you will have made there. I hated Ucsd and I still do have complaints about the system, but I’ve got a really soft spot for Ucsd. I still consider it my home. I hope all my Ucsd friends are doing well, they’ll probably be graduating in June. I love you all. 

Sorry for the wall of text. I do hope I was able to help at least one person though :)

8ikoh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/8ikoh9/on_the_current_state_of_computational_majors_here/,On the current state of computational majors here at UCSD,112,116,2018-05-10 20:14:33,"When we all (and by we, I mean every current student) were deciding on coming here, we were *all* told that it's possible to take classes in whichever departments regardless of our own because the school ""values interdisciplinary study"" or whatever BS they tell people on tours. Needless to say, most of us bought into that.

This isn't intrinsically a problem; the issue comes with how the CSE department has been run. For reasons unknown (I think it's because they feel like they're hot shit now due to the popularity), the CSE department administration has really turned into nothing less than a shitshow run by a bunch of egotistical dicks. By virtue of their antics regarding class enrollment, the department has manufactured an elitist mentality that not only harms the general sentiment towards the university, but also creates an unfair advantage for those in the ECE/CSE departments.

To elaborate on said antics, people who are Math-CS or COGS ML now get screwed over by those in the ECE/CSE majors because:

1) A large amount of their classes (110, 120, 130, 150, etc) have enrollment restrictions that pretty much guarantee that nobody outside of those departments can take the course (regardless of if it is in their major or not). Example: Math-CS students and CSE 101/110.

2) The other departments do not have this same restrictive behavior, so CSE/ECE students can freely take spaces in those courses and prevent people actually in the major from getting spots in the classes they need to graduate. Example: COGS 118 series courses (generally offered once a year) getting filled by CSE/ECE majors without COGS majors actually being able to take the courses, even though the courses are mandated by their degree audits.

I know that the first issue I mentioned was implemented to ""make sure that CSE/ECE majors can graduate on time"". This still doesn't justify making a lot of other students either less attractive candidates for graduate schools due to less knowledge of the field that they want to study/making *other* students graduate later due to not getting their own major classes due to overflow from people with protected spaces in their major.

Both of the above issues end up unfairly boosting CSE/ECE majors into a more preferable position by virtue of nothing more than what declared major shows up on their degree audits. Frankly, it's a hot load of shit.

Some solutions would be to:

1) make all classes in all departments restricted to only students in that department (barring anyone from taking classes outside of their major, but making the treatment fair and even across the board). If some CSE major comes crying about not being able to take the machine learning classes in the COGS major, then so be it.

2) open up the restrictions on the CSE courses and make them like everyone else: first come, first serve. This puts everyone on equal ground again. Have a bad enrollment time? Sucks; find something else.

I know this may seem like pointless whining, but the opinions of non-CSE computational majors should matter as well. And I know, I know: ""you should have gone somewhere else if you really wanted CSE."" Maybe I should have gone somewhere else, yes. But ultimately, I came here because the thing I study now is interesting to me and I was originally under the impression that I would be able to expand upon my field of study to still end up where I wanted to. Had I known that this is what I'd really be dealing with, I would have been at /r/CalPolyPomona, /r/UCI, or the other schools I got into for CS.

tl;dr: the CS department thinks they're hot shit and this mentality fucks over a lot of other students, and I think it's time that they get called on their BS."

I posted a response to that piazza post, but she or one of the other instructors quickly deleted it.

Now, I am not and in the class but she knows who I am since she is an instructor. I posted this as anonymous to classmates. Her behavior cannot be tolerated. I've heard numerous complaints about her over the years, and the abusive ways in which she treats students. I do believe that /u/r2zhong should report her, but I don't know if anything will come out of it, since she really the main professor who teaches CSE 3/7 and the department is short staffed as it is. However, I think reporting her will at least force her to treat others better.

/u/r2zhong if you do decide to report her, and need to find out who I am, let me know. While I haven't personally taken her class, the fact that she deleted her post knows that she fucked up. She wouldn't pass up the opportunity to bolster her ago and go on another power trip if she could come up with a decent response for my post.

Copied from /u/r2zhong's previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/8px9ts/can_cse_professor_put_our_academic_information_on/), here is what she posted.

&gt; Do NOT post INAPPROPRIATE material. Your homepage image of a cat does NOT relate to your UCSD academic career as required in Lab#1. I will reprimand the tutor who approved of it.
&gt;

&gt; Can I do some funny stuff website and put it on the server?

&gt; 
&gt; If not, how do we create our own?


A friend told me about this post so I went on CSE 3's Piazza page and posted the following reply, after which the post was deleted... took about 10-15 minutes


&gt; Professor Marx,
&gt; 
&gt; With all due respect, you sharing personal information of a student that is only available to you as a professor is out of line and very unprofessional.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; You have no right to to belittle the student publicly with information available only to you, not to mention speak of a different college as if you know what their academic standards are. Yes, UCSD is a prestigious university and most likely has a better standing then the Irvine College, but why would you go out of your way to speak ill of another public institution as an educator yourself?
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; You are disclosing a student's academic history, which is a violation of his privacy. Not to mention, this can be seen as harassment. Why would you publicly mention that information in the first place?
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; On top of it all, outside of your class, the personal contents of the student's website is none of the CSE department's concerns as they are not the ones providing the hosting, and hosting is available to everyone outside of the CSE department as well.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Also, an ISP is not who you contact if you wish to host a website.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Lastly, I am not a student in your class, and you can and probably will look up my information. I do not give permission to disclose my information publicly, as I do not wish the students of this course to know my information, which is why I am posting as anonymous to classmates. Yes, I've failed courses and yes I have been on academic probation, but that does not make me any less of a student. I found out about your post through a friend of mine that is enrolled in this course, and decided to speak up, as others might be to afraid to.

I can't believe that I have to create an account to say this because I was in a rush to get to class instead of saying it to both of your faces. 

I've never met such rude, and downright mean people at this university until now. Why did you have to walk by, laugh at me (I was the only walking towards them on an empty path, so it's not my imagination or fragile ego) and then comment by saying ""stubby"" to comment on my frame on a day when I was feeling like wearing shorts for once.

 I'm already conscious enough about my stature and my weight, and to have you people point it out in such a manner while laughing directly at me is just cruel. How can fellow women who often know how it feels to be judged on appearances, do this to other women?

Throughout my whole three years at UCSD, I often hear mean, outlandish comments from other women directed towards other women in regards to how they dress or look. I just don't understand.

It is unfortunate that Congressman Lewis has stepped down as commencement speaker, but having Pradeep Khosla as his replacement is unacceptable. It will be difficult to find a suitable replacement on such short notice, but I know of one great man, who, with decades of unmatched professionalism, will rise to the occasion. That man ladies and gentlemen is none other than legendary UCSD professor Gary Gillespie. Sign this petition to get Gary for 2018 commencement speaker!!!"

A marshall advisor told me i wouldnt make it to med school with those grades. Already suffering from depression, ptsd, and anxiety, i gave up after hearing that and switched out of stem. 

i completed 2 years then went home bc my sister was suicidal and self\-harming and had already run away from home. my mom was disabled bc of a chronic condition and primarily bed\-ridden. my parents were divorced so my dad was out of the picture. i tried going back to school and am still trying, but at this point, im facing financial difficulties going to school and i have too many responsibilities on me at home which prohibit me from leaving home. im currently a college dropout while people who started at ucsd with me are all at great jobs or entering med school and the like. theyve got experience and an education. im uneducated and cant even work bc of the situation at home so i dont have any experience either.

i miss studying. i want an education. i know what i want to study and i love it. i have a dream, i really do. but almost no way to reach it. i feel like such a failure with no future. life is scary. i have no friends bc ive lost touch with them all as i became more and more buried under all this pain and all these responsibilities. 

ever since dropping out, ive faced true hunger, beatings for 14 hours, and so much pain and sadness. im truly tired. 

i intended on congratulating this graduating class because so many of my friends will be congratulating, but i ended up making this another dumb, self\-absorbed post about myself. i really do suck haha 

i wish you all the best, especially the class of 2018. im currently living through you all, so walk that stage with pride and happiness for my sake. you all made it and im so proud of each and every one of you. if youre considering not attending the ceremony, please attend it for my sake. i love you, my fellow tritons. thanks for the memories, ucsd. and to any current college student, if you can help it, dont drop out. and if situations force you to drop out, im sorry.

Why or why not?",74,14,2018-06-14 13:24:00,"The more I think about this, the more baffled I am that professors have unrestricted access to our student records.

Not only do professors have no reason to see my academic history, it can also create bias towards me as a student if they view my academic history and see something they don't like. Examples could include things such as failing a class that they are teaching but under a different professor. This bias might even be subconscious. 

I am curious what you folks think should be the policy towards professors having access to our academic history. I realize that this subreddit represents a very vocal minority, and based on my previous post there is a decent chance that many of you will agree with me.

However, I am interested to see if anyone disagrees and can provide a valid reason why a professor would need unrestricted access to a student's record. 

Potentially, I would like to bring this to the attention of the administration and see if we can change the policy. My main reason for posting this is to gauge what others think because while I feel strongly about this issue, I realize that I may be wrong and don't want to make a fool of myself."

I tried resetting it, plugging it back in, and it didn't work, so I called ResNet and they told me that as part of the ""upgrade"" they completely disabled the ethernet ports, and to use Wifi instead. 

Which seriously blows because I rely on a wired internet connection for my desktop to prevent any sort of latency issues whether it be in games, streaming or otherwise. Even with a really high end wifi adapter, I still experience latency problems when playing online games. Playing Fortnite is just impossible now, lol. 

I don't really know where I'm going with this, but I guess I just felt like venting a bit, it's such BS that the one option for reliable internet connection just got taken away, and I have to depend on shit-tier wifi which doesn't feel like much of an upgrade at all.

I just finished my two-day Revelle college orientation and I had a wonderful experience. After the event ended, a felt more reassured in my decision to attend my second-choice University. My first choice, like many, was UC Berkeley. My expectation, given that I had a high GPA and an above average test score, did not meet with reality. I was rejected (wait listed, and then rejected). There's no doubt I felt disappointed and somewhat doubtful that UCSD at Revelle college could satisfy my expectations, at least a little bit. But, I have to say, I'm surprised at how intellectually and social stimulating the school was. It made me feel foolish that I even had doubts in the first place! 

This college and it's orientation leaders really opened my eyes to what I could do at UCSD. I think they succeeded in developing a strong community before classes have even started and I'm extremely grateful for this newfound feeling of belonging.

Hopefully, in the years to come, I feel the same way now as I do in the future. And speaking of future, I'll see all of you at Welcome Week!

Too many people are unaware of the possibilities of California Burritos in the neighborhoods of San Diego surrounding UCSD. I have eaten at over two dozen locations around San Diego, and have felt the need to write this guide. The scores reflect my experience eating CALIFORNIA BURRITOS ONLY, so the food there might be better or worse depending on what you order. 

I like my California Burritos as follows:

* Marinated, slightly charred carne asada
* Semi-melted cheese, not too much
* Crispy fresh fries
* Not too much sour cream
* Hot, smoky salsa with a higher level of viscosity
* NO OIL POOLING AT THE BOTTOM
* Toasted, flaky tortilla
* Ample seating, access to a clean restroom, open soda fountain, quick service

**Immediate Vicinity**

1. Taco Villa (4/10): It's not the best, but I consider it my favorite option on campus when I'm stuck with a gap in between classes. Their red sauce is pretty good, and their green sauce is decent. Sometimes they hit me with the banger burrito with nice charred meat and fresh fries, but this is becoming a rarity as of recent. The main problems are as follows: high price point, inconsistent quality, an excess of grease at the bottom of some of the burritos, and long wait times. Still, the silver lining is there as I give bonus considerations for vegetarian options.
2. Los Primos (5/10): Better than Taco Villa on average, but also painfully inconsistent. I've been given the wrong order many times ever since new staff was hired ~6-7 months ago, and other times I've had a pool of grease at the bottom of my burrito. Some of the staff members are excellent! They care about you, your experience, and make great conversation. The facility is pristine with lots of TV's to view. However, when it comes to the burrito itself, it's painfully frustrating to have to return to the counter and wait even longer to have an order rectified. The beef marinade is weak, but the fries are more often than not fresh.
3. Ramon's Taco Shop (6/10): I like the food here, but there are drawbacks. Minor inconsistencies in quality make this generally decent burrito sometimes disappointing, whether it be a weak beef marinade, limp fries, or a softer tortilla. The layout of the restaurant itself, when eating in, is my least favorite of anywhere else that I've been. They've crammed far too many chairs and tables in far too small of a space, and stashed the fucking soda machine behind the counter. This isn't a mall, nodbody's gonna steal your fountain drinks. Rant over. Decent food, bad eat-in experience. The sauces are average, with most of them being on the spicier side.

**Chains**

1. Rigobertos (6.5/10): Good salsa bar, strong in the flavor department, a bit heavy handed with the marinade and grease. Mira Mesa location is my favorite.
2. Vallartas (6.5/10): Red sauce is great, burritos are inconsistent, seating at the Clairemont Mesa location is abysmal in bad weather. I recommend the Pacific Beach location, but at that point I've got some better options.
3. Cotixan (7/10): Is it significantly different from vallartas? Well yes, and no. Far better consistency, and their extra options at the salsa bar are very cool. This chain beats the other two by a significant margin thanks to these two important factors.

Now the following suggestions will only have a score, as they meet the criteria I've mentioned, and differ only in the execution and consistency.

**PB**

* El Paisa (8/10)
* La Perla (8/10)
* Ortiz (7.5/10)

**La Jolla**

* Don Carlos (9/10) -- Vegetarian california burrito available! Huge portions with fantastic beef. Only thing preventing it from being perfect is the softer tortilla on the outside, and the slightly softer fries. Variety and consistency make this a top choice!

**Clairemont and Kearny Mesa**

* Lolita's (8/10)- No nonsense burrito. Great Sauce. Weaker marinade on carne asada. 
* El Portal (6.5/10) - Lackluster

**Linda Vista**

* LUPE'S TACO SHOP (10/10, PERFECT SCORE): If you don't believe in a higher power, I should use this as evidence to the contrary. These people always fucking nail it. Vegetarian burritos are available, they got the fancy soda machine, three types of salsas, all of which are fucking bomb. Meat, fries, tortilla are always fresh and satisfying.

* California Burrito shop (8/10): Good salsa, just missing that freshness due to a high volume of business. Vegetarian option.

I see a guy walking from the stairs so I pull up behind him as he's walking. 

Another car sees him also, but this car is driving the opposite direction as me and the guy who's walking. The car pulls up next to the guy, rolls his window down, and--I assume--asks him if he's leaving. The car then drives very quickly to the end of the row, makes a fast U-turn, and pulls up behind me as I'm following the guy. 

The car puts his turning signal on. The spot is clearly mine, so I put my turning signal on. When the guy who's leaving gets in his car, I stop and wait. The car behind me then slams on his accelerator, pulls up next to me, slams on his brakes, screeching his tires. He rolls his window down and yells ""FUCKING FAGGOT"" as he's flipping me off. He then spits on my car and speeds off. 

I park. And as I'm walking out I see a couple other cars leaving. There are plenty of spots. It's summer.

I just finished my fourth year at UCSD and will be receiving my degree as soon as I finish up one last summer course, and I'm currently enduring the hellish nightmare that is the post-grad job hunt. Unfortunately, said job hunt isn't going all that well, and I find myself having to resort to applying for rather low-paying jobs in order to beat the competition.

I was wondering if I could get some input from other UCSD graduates who have stayed in LJ or the surrounding areas on how much you're earning + your major expenses (i.e. rent, utilities, auto insurance, etc.), and whether or not that combination allows you to live comfortably. I'm sorry if what I'm asking for is rather personal, but I'm just pretty clueless when it comes to budgeting and estimating.

For example, it would be EXTREMELY helpful if you guys could say something along the lines of:

* My salary is $s per year
* I pay $r in rent
* My other expenses xyz add up to $e per month
* I am (not) living comfortably

I won't get into whether the college system is good or bad (or which college is better (see footnote 1) because I am a Muir student and were I to try and talk about it I should rightly be told to STFU. I will however, speak briefly(lol) about the college system, only because if someone happens upon this post and is a transfer student or potential student and has no idea what the six college system is then it will be helpful to them? (idk.)

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

[The Six College System](http://provost.ucsd.edu/colleges/) ::(Link to the ""company line"" on the colleges)

&amp;nbsp;

The REal TEA

&amp;nbsp;

In the UK, all universities have a college system within the University and there are reasons for why they do that there. [(Link to a wikipedia article about the college system)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colleges_within_universities_in_the_United_Kingdom) As far as I can tell, it was created for administrations to better control those wild British kids. Idk. I'll be honest I didn't read the whole Wikipedia page cause its long AF and you didn't read it either. The salient point is that the UK universities employ this college system and its pretty different to how UCSD does  their college system. One example is UK colleges are their own entities outside(but not outside...next to?) the university and so some colleges have more monies than other colleges and something like accommodations will vary drastically between colleges. Also, certain colleges have like higher reputations than other colleges within the same university. For example, Oxford University has 38 colleges. One of those colleges is Christs Church, Oxford. You know who is an alumni of Christs Church? John Fuckin Locke. But people say that colleges don't really matter. But they do. Just like the colleges don't matter at UCSD. (\*COUGH COUGH\* THEY DOOOOO) . Even though the colleges are their own thing, it is not the college that confers the degree. It is the university that confers the degree. So you get at degree from Oxford University and you get a degree from UCSD.

&amp;nbsp;

The Point:

&amp;nbsp;

UCSD decided it would be cute and bougie to have a cOLLege sYstEm.

&amp;nbsp;

How does the Six College System Work At UCSD::

It doesn't. 

lol. i jest.

or do i.........

&amp;nbsp;

Basically, depending on the college you are in you take a certain course of classes for your GEs. These classes are **mandatory** for you to be able to get your degree from UCSD. (this will be important later)

&amp;nbsp;

(i know YOU don't care but my wrist is literally cramping because I have carpal tunnel and so im finna wrap dis shiet up quick like. don't pm me ur questions)

&amp;nbsp;

If you are a UCSD transfer student, you have most likely completed you GEs as part of the IGETC requirements from California Community Colleges. (You applied to UCSD, the application asked you to rank your college preferences, you had no idea WTF the colleges were and you didn't pick Muir as your 1st, 2nd, &amp; 3rd choice. Like an IDIOT.) 

What you don't realise  is that you just potentially fucked yourself anally. Without consent. If for some reason God hates you and you put Revelle as your first choice you did not potentially fuck yourself anally with consent. you 100&amp;#37; fucked yourself anally without consent. (can you fuck yourself anally without consent? serious question.)

&amp;nbsp;

but why and how have I just fucked myself anally without consent? If you are a transfer student you don't get out of taking the college GEs because you finished your IGETC. You still have to take them. You can't take them at community college or online (well there once class you can take online its for Muir tho. SOz.) you must take them AT UCSD. I'm talkin MMW, DOC, MCWP, etc etc etccc. 

&amp;nbsp;

The point is Muir has the fewest amount of college GE requirements of all the colleges. You can generally cover all of the requirements through your regular major lower and upper div requirements plus two writing classes. Or 1 writing class if you are a transfer (Which you can take online).

&amp;nbsp;

Lets travel back across the pond:

In the UK universities, there are certain colleges that are designated ""mature"" colleges. For graduate students and students who took a gap year or years and are starting university late. It just basically groups all the older students who probably don't want to spend time around a bunch of annoying 17-18 year olds. Since UCSD wanted be all cultured and cute and have a college system like the UK, I think that like the UK they should have a mature college. That college shalt be nameth Muir. And transfers won't have to suffer so much.

I know you’re crazy excited to be planning your schedules and going off to college, but remember to breathe. 

You made it in! Awesome job! You’re going into a great school. Your work in high-school payed off.

Just remember to go out there and enjoy yourselves Week 0. It’s all about participating in your colleges activity’s and meeting new freshmen friends. I’ve known people who skipped most of the events entirely, and ended up spending most of their free time in their rooms. 

The people you first meet on campus might not be your best friends 20 yrs from now, but keep an active social life. It’s so much easier to build relationships in the first couple of weeks than in the second half of the semester.

Be yourself. Something something special snowflake. By voicing a dissenting opinion that you can back up, you provide something new to the conversation. Which reflects really well on you.  

Branch out- try the things you’ve always thought sounded cool.

Long story short, eventually I went to another bike shop that took off the rim tape of my back wheel and noticed that were several unnecessary holes drilled into the inner wall of the wheel, but they were not visible from the outside,

If you look at the video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKgEKO8XYaE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKgEKO8XYaE)  (the conversation starting 30 seconds is relevant to me, there is  another customer that talks in the beginning about his front wheel). Have anyone of you had a bike wheel like this? The weird holes are marked with a yellow highlighter. So the bike shop never gave me any notice of this defect, but at the same time, I have contacted KHS, and they will assume responsibility because their warranty only lasts for one year from date of purchase. (How was I supposed to know my back wheel had holes in it if it was covered up?)

TLDR: Unless you are buying a throwaway bike, read the warranty before buying and keep the receipt. And **DON'T BUY KHS!**"

1. How close are you allowed to be with your professors? In high school I would talk to my teachers about random things and have conversations with them. They would laugh at my jokes and stuff. Should I be more professional in college? Like if I see a professor I have/had on campus, should I avoid saying hello or is that okay?
2. What school supplies did you use your first quarter and what supplies do you use now? I have markers that I bought that I'm really excited to use for notes but I don't know if I'm too old for that now and I'm scared people will make fun of me for having markers
3. Do people still take handwritten notes or do they just use their laptops now?
4. How do you nap in a dorm room? Will my roommates get mad at me for napping in the middle of the day?
5. Are small plants allowed in the dorm rooms? I have a small succulent named Mark Succ-erberg and I want to bring it
6. How many clothes do you think is appropriate to bring?
7. When watching Netflix or anything with sound in your dorm with other people, do you usually use headphones or do play it out loud?
8. What is the roommate social etiquette? Like do I say hi/goodbye to them every time I enter/leave the dorm? Do I invite them to eat with me or do stuff with me? I don't mind but I feel like it would get old after awhile, and they'll get annoyed.
9. Should I try to be friends with my roommates? I felt that the answer to this would easily be yes but other threads have been giving mixed responses.
10. I'm kinda scared I'll cry myself to sleep the first few weeks of college or maybe every week of college but I think that will make people uncomfortable so where can I do that without people looking at me?
11. Are you allowed to set morning alarms for when you need to wake up?
12. Is it true people avoid pooping in the dorm bathrooms? 

I think this is it for now. Thank you for your help"

There are three major career fairs being held in early fall quarter which are held through the Career Center (and student orgs in the case of Meet the Firms).

**Career Fairs**

[Science &amp; Technology Career Fair](https://www.facebook.com/events/987873861374440/) | [Handshake](https://ucsd.joinhandshake.com/career_fairs/5644?ref=recommendation-collection-show) \- Wednesday, October 10, 2018 at 9:30 AM – 3:30 PM

[Triton Fall Career Fair](http://career.ucsd.edu/triton-fairs/fall-fair.html) | [Handshake](https://ucsd.joinhandshake.com/career_fairs/5650?ref=recommendation-collection-show) \- Thursday, October 11th, 10 AM – 2:30 PM 

[Meet the Firms](https://www.facebook.com/events/266110564023345/) (Accounting Career Fair for '19 and '20 Grads) | [RSVP](https://goo.gl/forms/ThUn4rHRSSLhx6FR2) \- Thursday, October 11th, 5:30 PM – 7:30 PM

On the Career Center website, it notes that students ""MUST **register through Handshake** AND bring their **student ID** the day of the fair. \*Pre check-in is not being offered.\*""

It is recommended to look up the list of companies attending ahead of time and making a prioritized list of the companies that you would like to visit for day-of. Remember to bring copies of your resume and ask for business cards (if applicable, I'm not sure if this applies too heavily outside of business). 

**Applying for Jobs**

Handshake is a helpful tool for checking job postings, and there's an [Upcoming Events section](https://ucsd.joinhandshake.com/recommendation_collections/4) as well for more specific campus visits/office hours/career events. Some companies may not post on Handshake and might have their own applications through their websites, so check there as well. Additionally, companies may require you to submit both an application through Handshake and through their own portal, so please read the postings carefully.

**Career Development &amp; Other Networking Events**

* Many pre-professional student-run organizations will probably be hosting other career dev or networking events as well (e.g. bringing out alumni or companies). 
* The Career Center also offers walk-in advising. 
* Online, there's a student-run UCSD Resumes, Portfolios, and Websites [page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ucsdrpw/).

For business especially, fall is a crucial time for recruiting for positions with bigger companies/firms. If there are any fellow accountants here, this is the only time that junior and senior-level students will have an opportunity to apply for Big Four and other public accounting internships/full-time, so **please make sure that you are aware of application deadlines and come to Meet the Firms.** 

I know there's a few other student org leaders and successful students who are familiar with the recruiting cycle for different fields on this subreddit, so please feel free to jump in and add more info. Good luck with recruiting!"

TL;DR Just as the title says, yes, you can get Microsoft Office– Word, Excel, Powerpoint, OneNote– for free with your UCSD email. Go to [Microsoft Office for Students](https://products.office.com/en-us/student/office-in-education) and enter your UCSD email. I installed it, signed in with my UCSD email (at least one of the programs asks you for it iirc) and password and voilà you have the Microsoft Suite! :) A lot of people probably know about this already so sorry if this is redundant, but here it is.

I got a new computer today and was almost convinced to buy Microsoft Office from Apple. I forget how much it was, but the associate offhandedly mentioned that you could either buy it (just a code in a box I think) or install it from the app store. I sat down a little while ago and could not find what I was looking for. I complained to my mom about not finding it, to which she suddenly said that I could get it for free. So, I searched up microsoft for students and followed the instructions and now I have it:) Ofc I'll probably end up using Google Docs for stuff but in case ppl are like me and didn't know, I hope this helps save you money and a trip to the store.

The Financial Aid and Scholarships Office is currently implementing a new processing system. Due to unforeseen complications with this new system, we were unable to finalize all students’ financial aid packages within our normal timeframe. Because of the unavoidable delays, your Fall 2018 payment is not due by the payment deadline of Friday, September 21st and you will not incur a late fee. The balance may be due to one or more of the following unpaid charges: tuition, registration fees, Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP), housing and meals, or bookstore charges, etc.

You are NOT required to make payment by Friday, September 21st

You will NOT be dropped from your classes

You will NOT incur late fees

However, you should be aware of the following important information:

You should check TritonLink to ensure you have completed all “Required Documents and Tasks” under Financial Tools/Financial Aid.

Regardless of your financial aid status, you are ultimately responsible for all university charges.

If your financial aid covers none or only a portion of your charges, you are responsible for the remaining balance.

Balances must be paid by the next Billing Due Date of October 19th.

Failure to pay by October 19th will result in a hold preventing you from enrolling for Winter 2019.

If you decide to withdraw from UC San Diego for the Fall 2018 quarter, you must follow university withdrawal procedures. We encourage you to speak with a financial aid counselor prior to withdrawing.

The Financial Aid and Scholarships Office sincerely apologizes for the inconveniences you may have experienced. We are working diligently to resolve all outstanding issues. If you do not have items on “Required Documents and Tasks” under Financial Tools/Financial Aid in TritonLink, there is no further action required on your part at this time. Please check your UC San Diego email account often as you will be notified if additional requirements are needed.

We wish you the best for fall success!

They have some REALLY cool topics like a class about the band Radiohead, knitting, BioDesign, and shit like that. Look them up, they are pretty neat! Some even being really competitive to get into.

In fact, I can't really even get an interview. I started searching in the early spring, wasted my time interviewing with a startup I met at the campus career fair, got an offer, negotiated a salary, had the offer rescinded when they sent me a contract with a salary about 30% lower than we had agreed and I questioned them about it. Since then I've applied to literally every entry level position I've seen on every job search site and job board that I know of. I've contacted two different placement agencies, one of which got me an interview, but I didn't get the job. I've went around to different company websites searching their job listings and applying if I feel I might meet even 10% of their qualifications. I've expanded my search out of the city and state and I still can't even get the time of day from employers. My resume goes off into the void without any indication of whether or not they've even seen it. 

My internship was somewhat tangential to the field and provided absolutely no relevant experience, but like a dumbass that needed to get his fix of not being broke, I took it. I look for entry level positions, which seem very few and far between, and most of the time I don't meet even the most basic of requirements for the job, i.e. I don't know front end frameworks, .net, Objective-C, etc. I'm in the process of trying to learn some of this stuff. I apply anyways. I tailor my resumes to the position I'm looking for. I've had my resume reviewed by several people, including the placement agencies, to get advice on how to improve it. I realize this is probably the most important thing when competing with dozens of other people for a single position. 

I feel like my CE degree and my coursework isn't enough to get me a hardware job because I had to take a bunch of CS classes and it isn't enough to get me a software job because I had to take a bunch of EE classes. I'm a jack of both trades, master of neither. I graduated with a 2.8 GPA, and whoever keeps saying companies won't ask about GPA is a damn liar. They do. Some even ask for transcripts. That doesn't stop me from applying though.

So my question is mainly to CE or CS graduates, but also anyone who's experienced this, which I presume is quite a lot of people. How did you find your job? Where did you look? What were you doing wrong in the first place? What did you end up doing right? Or else, where is the best street corner to live on? I'm getting desperate here, folks. "

Just something about her, she seems really unqualified to teach this section. Whatever the reason may be. Perhaps she hasn’t played with Java for a while, but to tell us things like, “a parent class must be abstract for it to have a child class that extends it.” And, just basically sounding absurdly unsure in practically everything she’s said thus far. 

I mean damn, I feel bad, but I really don’t want to learn such fundamental topics from her.

I don’t have a problem with a professor who doesn’t know the answer to something, the catastrophic part comes in when they would rather save face and be adamant about being wrong rather than just admit they don’t know.

I was a freshman in 09, left on academic probation for personal reasons, attended another school outside of the country, and even had financial holds.

During the readmissions process I had to clear all financial holds that I wasn't even aware of and was just really honest to the counselor about my life circumstances.

For those concerned about readmission, as long as you haven't been wasting your life away outside of school and are truly prepared to return to school, be honest and the chances of readmission should be pretty likely! Official transcripts if you attended another school is mandatory. My grades weren't great, but I showed why and what I have been doing with my time outside of academia.

Just a tip, clearing financial holds might take a while so make sure it's taken care of asap. You can't do ANYTHING until you clear your holds first.

Best of luck!"

I had just finished my PA in the dungeon when I saw it. The Mystery Machine was parked in front of the JSOE, and the horrible Shaggy stepped out, licking his lips as he looked for his next meal. 

&amp;#x200B;

An unfortunate student wearing airpods and riding a bird scooter was his first victim. I remember his cries as Shaggy picked him up and examined this new prey. 

&amp;#x200B;

""OH GOD, I'VE GOT AIRPODS ON, I CAN'T HEAR YOU! I DON'T SPEAK BROKE!"" the student cried, but Shaggy ignored his rambling and swallowed him whole (much to my relief). However, Shaggy was still hungry, and he locked his eyes onto me, his next target. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did the only thing that any sweaty CS nerd who hasn't showered in 5 weeks would do.

&amp;#x200B;

I ran back to my reshall. 

&amp;#x200B;

I ran fast, the fear of Shaggy still fresh on my mind. After what felt like an eternity of running, I finally made it to the door and shut myself inside of my bedroom, hoping that I lost him. Shaggy was not to be deterred. Within a few seconds, his Ultra Instinct has guided him straight to my reshall. There was no escape.

&amp;#x200B;

I trembled in fear as I heard the footsteps coming closer. 

&amp;#x200B;

""*He's here!*"" I audibly gasped. ""*Oh god he's here... Shaggy is coming to the reshalls to SWALLOW me whole!*"" I turned to the only beacon of help in this forsaken dorm - my body pillow of the one and only Gillespie-sama. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wept, for the end was near, and fell to my knees. Tears came down my cheeks as I clasped my hands together and prayed ""Please save me, Gary-sama."" 

&amp;#x200B;

It was no use, the footsteps came closer and closer to the door of the reshall, and I could hear a loud ZOINKS! as the door came flying off its hinges. ""This is how it ends."" I thought to myself. Shaggy's fist made a hole in my bedroom door, and his menacing visage followed. At that moment, I thought all was lost.

&amp;#x200B;

At that moment, a miracle happened. Gary Gillespie came bursting through the window, with his knife in one hand and the keys to a Lexus in the other. 

&amp;#x200B;

The atmosphere was intense. Shaggy stared at Gary, but Gary returned his gaze. 

""How unprofessional of you, Shaggy-san,"" Gary laughed. ""I thought after our battle ten years ago that you would learn not to attack my worshippers. Since you have broken this matter of principle, I shall deduct professionalism from your body.""

&amp;#x200B;

Shaggy didn't reply, his murderous eyes were fixed on Gary's. All of a sudden, Shaggy lunged for Gary's throat. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Watch out Gary-sama!"" I cried, but Gary was quicker. He ducked and grabbed Shaggy by his green shirt. 

&amp;#x200B;

""NANI THE HELL GARY BRO?"" Shaggy cried, dumbfounded. Gary didn't hesitate and deducted 100% professionalism from Shaggy. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Unfortunately for you Shaggy-chan, it's a sad situation"", Gary spoke triumphantly, and smashed Shaggy's body, dignity, and dining dollars to bits with his mustache. 

&amp;#x200B;

I gazed in awe at my savior, Gillespie-sama, and once again fell to my knees before him. ""Rise, my child"" Gary spoke. I looked up at his holy figure. His eyes shone brightly of a CS major who hasn't slept in two weeks. ""Thank you for acting professionally"" he spoke, and ran off into the night, Shaggy's blood still fresh on his clothes.

&amp;#x200B;

That was the best night I've had in years."

They emerged from camp snoops and quickly spread across the entire campus. After devouring the bio kids and absorbing their life essence, they were able to engineer themselves to become better, faster, stronger. They stormed the basement; they poured into Jacobs like a veritable flood. They made themselves new bodies. Riding mechs 10 feet taller than the tallest man, with brains and muscles superior to anything else on Earth, they decided upon our doom.  

Greater San Diego area has fallen. I cannot speak for what's outside, as we lost contact long ago. From where I am though, I can see that the quarantine barriers have been demolished, smoke rises eternally from the horizon, and the sky is pitch black.  

6 years. 6 years have the last of us been holed up in the 8th floor of HSS. They assumed nothing of value would be in this building, but they forgot about the food left over from countless philosophy colloquiums with half attendance. The supplies lasted us about a month, until we started eating the humanities students one by one. After they moved on from the main campus we were able to start foraging, but not a night has passed where any of us has had a full belly.  

Then we made a breakthrough. Under the leadership of the last professor alive, a man called Gary who has given us hope and guidance, we cracked the secrets of *time itself*. We have very little to power our machines with, and our experiments have been few. We sent a kid back in time to raid coffee shops and the like for any food whatsoever, but we haven't seen him since.  

I hope this message gets through. Supplies are dwindling and we've sighted them building near RIMAC, perhaps finally content to settle. One things for sure: they will find us, and they will kill us. Perhaps there are remnants of humanity elsewhere, but they're no match for these *things* and their inescapable drive to conquer and destroy. I can only hope someone reads this and takes action to prevent this terrible future.

&amp;#x200B;

Some background:

For as long as I can remember, I've been pretty depressed. When I came to UCSD this fall for my first year, my depression only worsened. This eventually led to an attempted suicide in October. Since then, I've seen psychiatrists and therapists, and things seemed to be getting better. But recently, it's gotten worse and I feel more depressed than I'd been back in October. No one really understand what I'm experiencing, but I myself know the exact cause of this: school. I've never struggled academically in school, so that's not what's causing the stress and depression. Just the thought of school kills me. Fall quarter was fairly easy, aside from my issues, but second semester, is terrible. I'm mainly struggling with motivation, but as of right now, I've already given up.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, the two options for me are dropping school, and venturing elsewhere, or suicide. I'm not really looking for people to tell me it's not worth it and that it'll eventually get better-- I've had plenty of that. What I'm looking for is someone that's experiencing the same as me, possibly contemplating the same things, too. Who knows? Maybe a simple conversation could lead to bigger things.

Got in UCSD in a major I ended up disliking shit tons, my GPA was low as heck, ended up changing majors to Cogs. w/ ML. Carrying on from my previous major, all I had left was ML-related classes (118 series), so I had two paths here. Take Math 20E and take COGS 118A-B, or don't take 20E and take COGS 118C-D. I got in touch with the professor for COGS 118D one year beforehand (around May 2018) and she confirmed 118D would be offered Winter 2019.

I could only take 20E in the summer session 2 of 2018 if I wanted to go through 118A-B route, but because I had stuff to do at home (mainly, help with organizing my room so I could rent it and live in SD without starving), I decided to skip 20E and just go through 118C-D.

Turns out, in mid of the fall quarter, COGS 118D is cancelled, and after contacting the dpt. they just said ""just pick another class and petition bro lol"", but then I'm left taking Math 180A for no reason and we're past the drop deadline. Ever almost died for no reason?

I try to petition COGS 118A's professor Tu and after explaining everything to him he just goes ""go suck a dick dude"" and denies my petition for Spring (had all classes but 20E), COGS 118C conflicts with a class I have to take so I can't take it either.

Because COGS 118D was cancelled without notice to its students, I have one class left for Summer Session 1, and oh, I got a job at a bank where they want me to start in June, oh, and it's out of state. Gonna have to take airplanes to do the exams? Who knows how's that gonna play out but fuck me in the ass with a horse sized dildo and I wouldn't feel a thing at this point.

IDK what to say. Jesus might as well come down and just say ""don't do ML or I'll fucking kill everyone you love"", or something like that. Shit man. It was a very strong ""not meant to be"" kinda shit, I feel if I fight it any further a blackhole will engulf the universe so I decided to save all our lives a drop the specialization.

Peace."

i'm writing this on behalf of my friend, who got sexually assaulted by Rohit Vallumchetla last year while he was still a student at UCSD, and was in the frat, pi alpha phi (https://www.facebook.com/team.rockittt). This sexual assault case has been ongoing for over a year, and even after my friend filed a restraining order against him, he still constantly emails, calls, and even drives from SF to LA to ""surprise"" her. this is one of the many instances that he has tried to contact her (this was from yesterday):

it's upsetting to see zero action from the police after we report every instance of his attempts to contact her. i'm writing this post to ask for any help on how to keep this person away from my friend. does anyone know of any other resources?? advice??

side note: shoutout to ucsd pi alpha phi frat brothers for chatting my friend to convince her to not tell anyone to save the reputation of their frat!!

Some encouragement from an alumni,288,15,2019-03-19 06:52:34,"Hey UCSD we see you during finals week dealing with the extra threat posting and investigation, and my heart pours out to all of you. 

Virginia tech happened while I was at UCSD, I can tell you exactly which warren lecture hall I was in when it happened, it was terrifying, and it was far away. My heart broke  yesterday when I read this story about UCSD, tritons are a special breed, and finals week is a fantastic sleep deprived mind f*ck 3 times a year.

After UCSD I went to graduate school, while I was there we had a shooting incident on campus. It was terrifying, and for weeks after (even now) I suffer with anxiety in crowded places. As others have said learn where your exits are, and sit strategically. If you are anxious about going to these specific places, identify where the officers are, there are likely more there then you realize when just passing by (think all the ones undercover during sungod in the Hawaiian shirts for example!)

A few things I’ve learned since then that hopefully may be helpful

1) take some time for yourself today and tomorrow, whether that be an extra nap, an hour coffee with a friend, some gym time, treating yourself to a nice dinner with someone, play an hour of video games, watch a tv show, whatever you can do to take a second for your mental health that is helpful (and takes you offline from the spirals of speculation). It may not feel like you have a second to spare while studying, but really truly take a second for your own sanity and mental/emotional health. It will help the refocusing and your studying especially with added stressors. I knew folks who used CAPS and always spoke highly of it, if you want an anonymous option.

2) kick major ass on your finals. You know this stuff, you’ve got this, every one of you has worked hard, so go and get this done. Try about 10 minutes of meditation if possible right before the final to calm your mind and calm any anxious thoughts. Anything you try to cram in the last 10 minutes likely won’t be on the test anyway ;) so breathe to calm the nerves and show them what you know!

b4kstr,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/b4kstr/an_honest_perspective_for_newly_accepted_students/,An honest perspective for newly accepted students from someone who had a good college experience,235,75,2019-03-23 09:05:22,"With the new students coming in, posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/b4ebub/psa_for_all_newly_admitted_high_school_seniors/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) are bound to pop up.  Angry people gatekeeping an entire university to be only for introverted pre med students.  New students that are considering coming here, please look at these with the right perspective: these are people on reddit, sad enough about their own college experience they feel they need to ""save"" others from experiencing the horror of UCSD.  

I'm here to give, what I consider, a realistic perspective on UCSD.  

The OP of that post can have their opinions boiled down to a few key points.  

1. UCSD is not for non-stem majors

2. UCSD is socially dead

3. The culture cannot be changed

UCSD is a STEM heavy school, that is for sure.  Specifically, it is a biology heavy school. I graduated recently with a degree in chemistry and didn't even consider UCSD for grad school because our chem program is ranked very low. If you're premed, this school is great for what you want to do, I have many friends from UCSD that are now in medical school.  Because this school is an R1 research school and very focused in Biology, it is true that the humanities seem to be overlooked.  If you're deciding between UCSD and a liberal arts college and want to know which will give you a better education in the humanities, its the liberal arts school 10/10.  BUT if you liked UCSD and got that feeling on visitation day that this was the place for you, then don't shy away just because the schools main focus isn't your program.  I have non-stem friends who graduated and are now in law school, graduate school, got their teaching credential, have started their own business, etc., and did it all on their UCSD degree.  It is entirely plausible that if you come to UCSD for the humanities you will be successful. 

Now to the more contentious point.  UCSD has a reputation for being socially dead.  A lot of people hear that and assume that means the student body is a sad miserable mass who just slogs through college without having a single good time.  I would like to put the idea of socially dead into the correct perspective.  If you imagine a stereotypical college experience, it would be going to the quad where the school has put on an event where everyone is drunk and partying.   That's not UCSD.  Not because people don't get drunk and party, but because people abandon campus pretty quick.  

To have a social life at UCSD you have to make your own fun.  That is a very true statement that people like to say but not explain.  Making your own fun doesn't mean finding fun stuff to do in your dorm. Making your own fun refers to the state of the school itself.  You're going to find that after welcome week, the events dry up and the school seems empty.  A lot of people get angry, thinking they were tricked and resort to sitting in their dorm deciding the school must be as socially dead as they had been warned.  

The truth is welcome week is a facade, because the real fun happens off campus.  Clubs have recruitment week 2nd week to fill that gap.  Dare I say it Fraternities and Sororities have rush week. 

Quick point on frats and sororities:  UCSD greek life takes itself a lot less seriously than other schools. If you're thinking about it, go to rush.  Greek life parties are generally the best at UCSD and it's a very easy way to make your own fun. If you can't see yourself in greek life or cannot stand the idea of them, that's fine, don't worry about it. Look into clubs or other orgs, no need to put yourself in something you can't see yourself fitting into.

But, join something!  This is where the fun gets made.  Every club will have parties, events, and tons of people you can share an interest with.  People who join organizations have gone out of their way to find fun at the school, when you join a group of people formed with that in mind, you're bound to have a good time.  UCSD has cultivated a culture where students gather together, outside the parameters of school mediated functions, to have their college experience.  It may not be typical, but it definitely isn't miserable.

Lastly, the OP of the other thread was right, you aren't going to change the culture.  There are 26,000 people at the school and some of them are having a bad time.  They go to class, go back to their dorm, sit at their computer and fume about how they aren't having a good time and it's the schools fault. As long as you don't find yourself falling into that trap, then you won't need to change the culture.  The culture is fine for the rest of us who have found our fun.  "

I don't even care if this is based in shitty mental health. I don't even care if CAPS is shit, although I'd still remind you that there's emergency lines. It's your responsibility to not hurt other people just because you're hurting. Mentally ill people are far more likely to be the victims of crime than the perpetrators, so if you're gonna use your mental health as an excuse, fuck you for perpetrating this stigma. Fuck you for hurting mentally ill people.

I do care, if this is for attention. Not about you, except about you receiving consequences. I care about the people lying dead and wounded across the world whose names you have the audacity to invoke. You think their tragedy is a little sticker you can slap on your bid for attention?

The black population at UCSD is very small and within a couple quarters, I had met all of them and am able to recognize every black student’s face. Not an over exaggeration.

The black population at UCSD is very weird. I’m not talking about the students that aren’t active in the black community on campus, I don’t know much about them. But I’ve noticed that there is a lot of criticism towards black students that don’t have black friends, but attempting to make black friends at this school is still so difficult. It’s like they’ve built a wall around their social circles. Which is fine, but none the less weird. The black community promotes this solidarity amongst black students, and while some of them actually promote it, there’s enough of them to make it seem fake. 

In regards to race relations with non-black students, it’s also weird. In the beginning, I was able to get along with everybody until I realized I was kind of a prop. For the first time in my life I was the “black friend” and I hated that. 

I went to an extremely diverse high school and not one of my friends of my intimate social circles were the same race, I was used to being the only black person in a social group, but not necessarily the “black friend.” When I use this term I’m referring to this act of being used to make your friends look cooler. It’s really dumb. 

There’s also this weird racial tension on campus. Way too many Asian hype beasts and it’s extremely embarrassing.

With all that being said, I’ve met people that I care about and enjoy being with. It’s very difficult to find your place on UCSD and it often feels like a “too black and not black enough” experience. I hope that this is not the same for you. I just wish that someone told me these things before I got here. Good luck here at UCSD! "

I probably went a little crazy when I was 18 living in Warren. But honestly the grass is always greener. All the complaints I had here were not much different than my friends’ at UCLA UCSB, UCI, UC Berkeley or any other school. We’re pretty much the same demographic of smart kids that happened to end up in different places. Except I’m honestly pretty god damn comfortable living in this sunny ass weather paying reasonable rent compared to anything in the bay or in LA. And I get to drive to the beach after class whenever I want. Sure I didn’t go to a million parties but I met really important friends and honestly we made the party. 

Empower yourself, don’t rely on your environment, or anyone else here. This really is your reality. You don’t have to live on campus and you don’t need to study in Geisel. You don’t even have to be friends with UCSD people. There is a whole city full of exciting and interesting people that love doing fun things. Get out and do as much as possible off campus. Get a surfboard. Buy a bike. Go jogging. Just do it all and don’t hang around too many people that consistently talk about how much is sucks here. Stay focused get good grades and experiment with alcohol and weed. Do it all! Challenge yourself. Don’t be scared to talk to people you think look interesting. Chances are they really want to talk to someone in class or the dining hall too. Humans are social creatures don’t forget everyone loves a good laugh or a good time. Be the influencer, be the out going person, introduce people, and get a nice ass tan while you’re doing it "

It was more of a crush from afar though and we haven’t hung out/really talked until recently to prepare for the final. I’m meeting him this week to study in person and that’ll be our first time hanging out but I’ve already lost hope bc our interactions through messenger are pretty short on his side/he won’t respond for a while/unless it’s actually necessary. Oh well, it’s nbd I guess, just wanted to mini rant bc the final confirmation was that I messaged something a couple hours ago that he didn’t respond to, I checked recently and it said he was active an hour ago.

At exactly 6:40am, everybody wakes up and makes their journey to the Sun God statue where we all pray for A’s for 13.5 minutes on the dot. It has to be exactly 13.5 minutes, any shorter he’ll ignore you, any longer he’ll get bored

At 8:00am, i go to my first econ class where all we do is chant “supply and demand”

At 11:45am, i walk through Library walk to get to PC to get food

At 1:30pm i finally arrive at PC after an hour and 45 minutes of rejecting fliers, talking about jesus, and saving some bees. I eat panda express and some burger king fries

At 3:00pm, i get my professionalism deducted because i asked about extra credit on piazza 

At 3:30pm, i cry for a little bit. Not because i want to but because i need to. Without shedding a few tears it’s impossible to pass your classes

At 4:00pm i check my email for the daily Coleslaw spam mails. Sometimes it’s him telling us about how accomplished he is but most times it’s cuz someone is stealing panties again.

At 5:00 i will either go to 64 Degrees or Cafe Ventanas to pay 9 dollars for steak the size of hamster. I thank HDH for being so generous with their portions

From 6:00pm-2am, i do homework. The first subject i always start with when doing homework is called “Procrastination” and the second homework alternates from “Smash” to “Minecraft”, depends on which one is due sooner

At 3:00am i finally go to sleep.

At 3:01am i am woken up by my roommates snoring

Next day, rinse and repeat.

There is your average day of an average UCSD student. Go Tritons!"

Coming in to uni I was terrified but also determined to find my place after years of feeling lost and lonely. I'm just a second year now but wow did these two years fly by. And each day is stressful and busy with academics, clubs, labs, etc. Hdh isn't great, transportation sucks, and everything in La Jolla is hella pricey. But each day I feel so blessed and so grateful to be here. I met so many great people here, among both students and staff. For the first time in a long time I am just...happy.

Ok, so, I've been through a lot of hardship in the past four years, and having to live with people I don't know and all of the other stress that comes with school sure didn't help. But I'm a senior now. I have a solid friend group which I'd never had before and we always hang out, pretty much every day. I'm graduating this quarter and think I might have a decent job lined up. A lot of the hard times are over. Soon I'll be more financially stable and have a decent job. I get to move to Sacramento with my roommate after college. I'm doing well financially for a student, and managed not  to take out loans, even though my family and I aren't well off. Things really worked themselves out, and even though there were some really tough emotional times, I feel like a lot of the pain is gone and I feel stronger and more experienced. I feel prepared for post-college life, and have gained a new sense of confidence in the past year. I feel like I can really be myself too which feels so amazing. I just want to let everyone out there who's struggling right now know that everything will be ok. I know it's tough now, and it really sucks. I completely get it, but please know that things will get better if you just keep on trying. It's ok to break down and have periods of time where you're super depressed and do nothing. You will push through it. Not to mention, some amazing things come out of hardship, like amazing friendships and incredible strength. Please don't give up, because one day you'll wake up and feel motivated to do what you love and put effort into life. So if you're up right now, feeling sad, lonely, depressed, or angry, and you're reading this, please know that I really do believe in you.

bftosn,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/bftosn/some_controversial_and_noncontroversial_advice/,Some controversial and non-controversial advice for incoming students,99,34,2019-04-21 14:11:15,"I am going to use a throwaway, because I know I am going to piss off some people with this post. Here are some of my tips people entering UCSD. These will all help you out with internships, general happiness and your overall mental health.

1. Greek life is pretty mild for the most part, and if you are at all interested in being social, it is probably the easiest way to do it. You'll make friends who are 3rd to 4th years that can help you out and have the same amount if not less drama than a large amount of clubs on campus. (Fraternities anyways)

2. Physical attractiveness matters when applying for happiness, internships and jobs. You might not have the best facial structure, but working on the appearance you can change will help you immensely. It is not the end all be all, but being attractive has shown to help in peer reviewed studies. Go to Rimac, eat healthier, buy form fitting clothes (thrift stores are great for finding good deals), work on your posture, try out different hairstyles, work on reducing your acne and buy nice looking glasses or switch to contacts. 

3. Learn how to talk to people. If you are shy, just keep joining clubs, join a speech and debate team, learn how to present, reduce your use of umm, talk to people in your reshall/apartment, introduce yourself to people sitting next to you in class and don't just blindly agree with everyone about everything. 

4. Be interesting. You will be living in San Diego which is home to great surf, nice beaches, we have beginner classes for sports, join a recreational team, play pick up basketball, go hiking, learn to cook, and learn how to play an instrument. Having hobbies and interests that might align with an interviewer.

5. You might have been the top of your school, but you'll most likely just be an average student here. The quarter system hits you fast and hard. You can have a competitive edge by starting to study THE DAY YOU START CLASS.

6. If you're somewhat conservative, don't get into heated arguments, because nobody has anything to gain through heated discussions. See Berkeley for a prime example. Most people ideals are hard ingrained into them, and if you really want to drive your point forward, be nice to everyone and don't be disrespectful. 

7. Your GPA matters, but so does your wellbeing. Take care of yourself. You won't destroy your future if you are completely overwhelmed and skip a class every so often to relax. You will have a higher net productivity if you are extremely stress, take a couple hours to work out, go for a walk, or eat a nicer than normal meal and resume your work afterwards.

8. The school is only socially deal to people who didn't try, are weird or have to work extensively to make it in SD. Reddit has only been a good hive for people with depression and social issues. Most happy people spend their day working on school work and hanging out with friends and not complaining online. You can find your fit if you try. 

9. The office of students with disabilities is the worst in the UC system. Start figuring out accommodations with them now. They are terrible, slow and are booked until week 8 by the 1st week of every quarter. They will make you jump through hoops and possibly waste a lot of money to get accommodations. 

10. If you're already fighting with your significant other about long distance or you are just not extremely happy with them, it's not going to last. You really should consider breaking if off with them and learn how to be single again. 

11. Try staying out late once or twice; you might end up having a lot of fun. I am not saying chug a whole bottle of vodka on the beach or something reckless. Just take a nice bike ride or skate around campus, go get food off campus at a 24/7 Mexican restaurant, visit your friend at a nearby college etc."

I didn't include all upcoming construction projects, and there are a myriad more in the planning phase (7th and 8th colleges, renovated markets and dining halls, etc).

b95w49,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/b95w49/gauging_interest_in_a_fullyonline_intro_python/,Gauging interest in a fully-online intro Python course,96,30,2019-04-03 17:23:58,"I'll be joining UCSD CSE as an Assistant Teaching Professor in the 2019-2020 school year, and I'm currently writing a proposal to create a fully-online completely auto-graded introductory programming course in Python. The proposal is due on Friday, and I wanted to get the perspective of students/alumni in terms of interest in the course.

My motivation for proposing the course is to alleviate some of the pressure in CSE 8A/8B/11: this course would hopefully be targeted at non-CS majors who require an introductory programming course for their majors (e.g. Psychology), non-CS majors who generally want to learn how to program in a useful language (e.g. Biology), and CS majors who just want to learn how to program in Python (but it it likely won't replace the CSE 8A/8B/11 requirement for CS majors). I'm hoping that, if we introduce this fully-online course, we'll be able to free up some space in 8A/8B/11.

The course differs from the DSC courses in that the DSC courses place a heavier focus on statistics and for the most part teach basic Python syntax to just run commands, whereas the course I am proposing would be very similar to CSE 11 in terms of concepts that are covered (including OOP), but all in Python.

If you've taken CSE 100 in recent years, you're likely familiar with the Massive Adaptive Interactive Text (MAIT) I wrote for the course ([Data Structures](https://stepik.org/course/Data-Structures-579)). My proposed Python course will be centered around a MAIT similar in style to the one I wrote for CSE 100, but of course covering Python/logic/OOP/etc. My motivation here is that, if you've never seen programming or any form of CS logic before, if I want to teach you if-statements, I don't want to have to teach you complex Java syntax, how to navigate the terminal, the difference between source code vs. byte code, how to use the Java compiler, why you have to run `javac` each time you make changes, etc. before I can even test you on the actual if-statements. With an MAIT, I can introduce the if-statements and basic syntax as-is within the web browser, abstracting all those lower-level details until later in the course. I can also integrate small auto-graded challenges to test knowledge as you're learning, as opposed to relying on quizzes and just the larger programming assignments.

I also plan to have a few larger programming assignments to test that students understand how to actually build things from scratch (as opposed to just filling in the simpler challenges), which I intend to run via GitHub Classroom. My worry here is that expecting beginners to learn how to use GitHub might be difficult, but I'm hoping I can maybe integrate that at the beginning of the course or something. Any feedback here would be especially great.

That's all I can think of regarding relevant specifics of the course as well as my thought process behind the proposal, so yeah, I'd love to get an idea of the reception of a course like this and any comments/feedback you may have!"

Instantly realizing I was going to be late for the lecture, I rushed out from my dorm and ran towards the classroom, hoping to make it on time in case he takes attendance. I have never ran so fast in my entire life, at some point I feel like I am Usian Bolt himself. Unfortunately, my incredible speed led me to my downfall(literally). While I was taking a shortcut in the woods near library walk, I tripped myself over a GIGANTIC rock and fell. While I was flying in the air, I looked back at my life. Was there remorse? Did I fulfill my life purpose? I fell because I was trying not to be late for Ali’s lecture, this is what I will call a worthy death indeed. However, since I survived, albeit lying on the temporary stone tomb for a while, I still have to go to class. After resting for 20 minutes or so, I crawled my way to the lecture.

Maybe it's the impacted major I'm in, bad studying habits, time commitment for orgs, maintaining relationships with friends, parties, etc... All these ""distractions"" and the difficulty of the major has impacted my grades significantly. I've been on Academic Probation three times now and was fortunate enough to continue with my studies. (I see those recent AD post and I feel for you guys I hope your appeal goes through). But basically the problem is I'm barely skating by and I feel so inferior compared to everyone else. 

I have a C average in a majority of my classes and there's nothing I can do to save my GPA - will never reach a 3.0 that's for sure. It's like having the feeling of the imposter syndrome but knowing for a fact you are a fraud within a sea of hard working dedicated students who actually deserve to be here. No body knows of my situation, not my parents or my peers. Fake it till your make it I guess... My future for grad school is basically out the door. I don't know what company would ever hire a C average new grad. I'm so scared for my future. It's been a difficult year dealing with this on my own and admitting to my failure.

I guess where I'm going with this is that I'm seeking advice from people who can relate. I know there's nothing I can do about my grades now but is there hope in my future? Has anyone been in my situation - the feeling of the imposter syndrome - and overcoming it? I've wanted to get this off my chest for some time now and I guess now that I'm entering into my last quarter of college, everything is daunting onto me and getting too real too quick.

ok so this is a cringe post but listen i have no dignity left to care anyways i lost a pin on my backpack which i got from fortnite sAVE THE WORLD NOT BATTLE ROYALE (not that its any better) for doing some stuff in the game and i realized i was missing it while in the middle of my class in peterson and i backtracked my entire path before i realized i lost it and i still couldnt find it so maybe one of u saviors will somehow stumble upon it:

![img](5j9lf1zd46r21 ""this is path"")

1. Walked from suite to elevator on floor 2 to floor 5 and filled up my HyRYDoFLASk in OVT.
2. Walked across OVT bridge and decided to ride to activate a Spinbike which was at the table outside marshall field near the J apartments.
3. Rode towards Peterson Hall to take the bike path. **The fact that I'm riding on a bike with pins could possibly loosen the pin.** 
4. Went down that forest hill bike path thing. **There's a bunch of vibratey bumpy bumps going downhill that could possibly loosen the pin.**
5. Did this weird turn to get onto Library Walk towards Center Hall 101. **Library walk is also pretty bumpy I guess.**
6. Went to that one coffee stand behind Mandeville. (single mint mocha im too weak to take a shot of espresso or cortado)
7. Went to Pines for lunch then down to the seats outside M.O.M. to chill there for a bit. I took off my sweater in Pines because it was getting hot, and then I threw my sweater over my right shoulder where the pin is on my backpack as well. **Since the sweater is rubbing against my backpack and the pin, it can probably loosen it.**
8. Walked to Peterson Hall 108. **Forgot to take off my backpack so I sat with my backpack against the chair. I guess that could have loosened the pin?**

I'm a member of Greek Life (sororities), and Panhellenic has told us NOT to talk to any news media outlets (both UCSD and in general). I want everyone to know that this is NOT the first time it has been happened. We have been told to shut our mouths and not discuss this information with anyone no matter what, so the reputation of Greek Life isn't tarnished. 

One case I would like to share is as follows: The victim reported the sexual assault to her chapter president the Sigma Chi's chapter president. These were the responses:  
Her chapter president blatantly said - ""There is not much I can do... There is a lack of evidence and I'm not sure if I can believe you because they're all nice guys.""

The President of Sigma Chi said not to report it and shoved it under the rug essentially -- he agreed with the PHC chapter president just so the reputation of Greek Life would not be tarnished. Essentially, both presidents refused to believe the victim who then reported it to the UCSD administration. The UCSD admin is throwing it under the rug as much as possible and not really enforcing anything... There have been many instances, and one victim has FINALLY stepped forward and there is so much proof. Truth is, doesn't matter if you were involved in the assault/rape... If you know and you don't do something about it, you're part of the problem. I don't want to be part of the problem so I urge anyone who knows information to report it to major news outlets. Greek Life needs to be banned effective immediately (and I say this as someone who has been in various EXEC positions throughout my 4 years of being in Greek Life). It hurts my heart to see these victims being treated this way by the sororites/fraternities. Greek Life doesn't care about sexual assault or rape until it affects them directly. It's disappointing to say the least, and I hope we as a community can gather together and uncover all the truths that have been hidden. I, myself, have been involved in some instances and I have been told to shut up about it. But I really think it's time everyone gets exposed, and we shed light onto this information."

I’m taking CSE 110 with Gary, and many of the quiz questions are entirely subjective; if you weren’t in lecture to hear exactly what he personally has to say, there’s zero outside resources which confirm his opinion. Despite being a CSE course, most of the material he grades on either isn’t remotely related to CS or is his personal belief on vaguely related topics. 

Some quiz questions in this upper division CSE course: 

**In the age of interruption, how do you stay focused?** 

**In a formal essay, where can the thesis sentence expected to be found?** 

**What is the goal of criticism?** 

**What are trust and betrayal?** 

**When you critize or correct your teammates you should also be \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.** 

**List one benefit of blame.** 

**When is the best time to take a vacation?** 

If you don't answer with exactly the response he wants, it'll be completely wrong; no common sense answers. 

If I were to go to the Dean of CSE with a list of examples like these from his tests, along with the material CSE 110 is advertised to cover, would there be anything they’d be able to do? Anyone else in CSE 110 feel the same way? 

These are the answers to the questions, in order: 

OHIO

The end of the first paragraph

Be corrective but also motivating 

Trust is earned, betrayal is a violation of trust

Motivating

None

Never

There are some aspects of the course which are related to CS, like Scrum. However, at least half of the quiz questions are like the ones above, where the questions and answers are based on Gary's opinion and nothing else."

I have never felt this depressed before. I feel like I should be grateful to be here but I am so unhappy. I used to be so excited to be at a 4 year university. I’m the first one in my family to go to college and the excitement that I felt when I first got to UCSD has turned into absolute terror to the point where I don’t even want to come to campus anymore. My first year was a rough adjustment because it was hard to explain to my parents the things I have to go through as a student since neither of them went to college. Second year was pretty fun up until recently. School used to be the only thing that really kept me going since I felt like at the end of the day I’m at UCSD and it’s a huge privilege to be here and to be studying at a public university since both of my parents started working during their middle/high school age in Mexico. When I got into UCSD my family and I were so excited and now I can’t even answer the phone when they call me because every time they ask how I’m doing I break down. I can’t really afford to fly home and see them and everyone is talking about summer plans and how they’re so excited to go home for the summer or doing internships or traveling and I am doing both summer sessions and I am not looking forward to it at all. I can’t focus, I can’t sleep, I have gone to caps and talked to the dean at my college and I still feel like I don’t belong here even though I know I got in for a reason and I feel like I am deserving of being here. 

Everyone is telling me to focus on what’s important and what’s going to get me ahead and I can’t do that anymore. School used to be the only thing that kept me going. Even though the stress of classes and midterms was exhausting at least at the end of the day I had the joy of finishing. Bad grades or good grades it felt good to at least be a student. It’s easy to get out of bed in the morning because I want to get my day started but once I starts I just want it to end. I feel like I’ve done everything I can to succeed and its still not enough. I used to feel that no matter what happened at least I have an education under my belt and I could help my family get ahead and now I feel that I’m letting them down because I can’t function anymore. I have told them and they remind me that when they were my age they could only dream of going to school and now they’re getting old and I’m sitting here complaining about being at a university and I don’t know what to do anymore. The quarter is about to end and I’m not looking forward to anything. I’m not looking forward to summer session. I’m not looking forward to my third year. I feel so guilty for being unappreciative of this opportunity. Anyway I just needed to vent. Good luck on midterms and finals everyone.

Hello All. Being the silly dude that I am I accidentally lost access to my burner account and had to make a new one. I first wanted to say thank you for all of the overwhelming support I received from all of you. I mentioned to my parents that I posted on a blog and they were both very touched by all of the kind people here at UCSD. After talking with my parents we agreed on having me come home for summer session one and returning for summer session two. Over the long weekend I broke down over the phone and we had a really long conversation about how I was feeling. Both of them said that they would rather see me home for a bit and maybe do an extra year at the university rather than see me suffer like this. They reassured me that there is no rush and that they love me and that it's okay to be sad. It was hard opening up about the mental health issues but I told them about the anxiety I was feeling and they responded very positively. It was good to hear from both of them that they are proud that I have made it this far, and they both think I deserve a break, which I am now realizing I deserve one too. A couple of people in the last post mentioned burnout, and I definitely feel that after 2 years of continuous school, being home and just enjoying the summer with my friends from my hometown is going to be refreshing, and I feel a lot more motivated to finish the quarter

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, if you pm-ed me, please pm me again! I am trying to find everyone from the previous post, but I think I might miss a few people here and there. I am so thankful for all of you, and I hope to make some new friends for summer session two and fall quarter. Your guys' support definitely gave me that extra bit of motivation that I needed to get through the remaining weeks of the quarter. I would still love to hang out or study with anyone who might need a study buddy! If anyone would like to talk, study, eat lunch together over summer session two let me know! I understand how lonely it can get out here, and anyone who is going through the same thing, my ears are open. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am so grateful for this community, again I hope all of your midterms went well and that you guys kick finals in the butt!"

I had google maps evidence, a tapingo receipt, and files on my laptop showing that I was in his classroom during the class period, as well as taking notes after the test would have been over.

I had the hearing about 3 weeks ago, and now have been given my sentence. I have been given a fine, been given mandatory academic misconduct classes and seminars, as well as being suspended from UCSD for the 2019 Fall Quarter

I have been emailing my professor for the list of students for the quarter that I was accused in to get other people to vouch for me being there to take the test, but he has basically been ghosting me for the past week and a half

I like a challenge. College is about both but I don't think either is what represents the aura of depression at UCSD.

So what does?

Being forced to buy a multi thousand dollar dining plan if you live on campus. Limited and unhealthy dining options with that plan. Overpriced goods at the markets when UCSD knows the nearest store is miles off campus. Extremely limited casual social opportunities because of tightly policing/regulating parties through your fellow students. Dealing with overcrowding and still admitting a record number of students. Wifi that does not work, and questionably an excuse to introduce a new ""technology fee"". A divided student body by international/national status and a confusing subcollege system. A mental health system (CAPS) that is clearly failing its students. Posters everywhere that describe psychological behaviors to monitor for in other students as indicators of suicide, and a private number to report these too. Posters everywhere claiming ""diversity, inclusion, equality"" when the admission demographics of the university clearly don't match up with what it's preaching. Necessary classes in ""diversity, inclusion, and equality"" that are based around just writing what your teacher/TA wants to hear. Rampant nepotism. Chancellor Khosla handing the Dalai Lama ""UCSD's highest honor"" and watching it break on stage two minutes later. Spam emails asking for more money while you're a student. Spam phone calls asking for more money while you're a graduate.

In short - The University does not care. And they are both completely unfraid to show it, and completely unashamed to lie about it."

Our infrastructure is falling apart, and our classes are unbelievably impacted. Most students have to spend more than 4 years to graduate, largely because of how difficult it is to get classes.

Instead of addressing these problems, Khosla is busy expanding the school to make more money. He's letting in record numbers of students, and he's opening seventh and eighth colleges.

And honestly, the recent string of emails asking for donations is straight offensive. I know students who are barely making it financially. Between paying for food, parking, tuition and housing, many students are *barely* getting by.

I honestly think Khosla would be better off in charge of a business. For-profit exist to sell products, and generate revenues. That seems more in line with Khosla's objectives.

I understand that a public university needs to make money too, but you wouldn't run UCSD the same way you'd run Amazon.

I'm not trying to start trouble, as I know college ""revolutions"" can get out of hand, but I really think we'd be better off with a different chancellor in charge.

If you think Khosla has got to go, or you think UCSD is better off with him in charge, I'd like to hear your thoughts on why."

Okay so I might be making a big deal out of this but I felt the need to post this on somewhere and let others know. My underwear was stolen. How do I know it was stolen? A good rule of thumb is to put underwear into a mesh or separate bag (girls or anyone else I guess, you know this). The bag came out empty and was closed. Everything else in the laundry was still there. Checked the laundry machines, the rims, the trash cans even...Nothing. 

Information portion: Laundry was stolen on Thursday night at Douglas Hall.

If it was stolen: 
1. Girls: be careful about your laundry
2. Can I get it back? There was over 40 dollars worth of underwear in there.

She talks in our dorm when she known damn right I'm working and can hear everything she says. I put in headphones but her loud ass voice can't be blocked. Can't tell her to talk outside or she gets seriously petty.

She also never leaves her bed, rarely goes to class. She's in the room 24/7, laying on the bed like a beached whale, talking on the goddamn phone. I've been woken up for the past 3 consecutive days at like 1am because she decides to have a phone argument with her bf, in the room, when I was asleep. 

There is no purpose to this post honestly, I'm just in a blind fit of rage and wanted to rant.

Last quarter, some of you may have encountered my [project](https://github.com/GWhisk/kms). In it, I said a lot about my own experience with UCSD's mental health services and also my struggle with own mental well-being. A big part of my struggle was my lack of friends and a social circle to fall back on. 

After reading the responses from kms, along with the stories people shared regarding their own struggles, I couldn't help but feel empowered and humbled by them. But I also realized that maybe, for some, this campus is too large to socialize through modern means (ironic right?)

What if we turn to antiquated modes? Like ... letter writing? 

There's something about crafting and receiving a written, physical letter that I feel emails and instant messages have difficulty in instilling. 

With that said, I'd like to start a penpal network here on campus. If you're interested in being a penpal, you can sign up and read more about how the network will work [here](https://forms.gle/tFHBy4iTgmYWpKXy5).

If you're interested in being a courier and helping with the exchange of letters, DM or email me (my email is in the form).

I’ve called caps but they don’t even have an initial 5 minute interview open for weeks and I really don’t want this to affect my grades even more.

The position will offer the student a chance to learn about stem cell modeling of neurodegeneration under a postdoctoral researcher in Fred Gage’s group. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common progressive age-related neurodegenerative disease, with 127M (or ~1.5% of the planet’s population) by the year 2050. Most of the drug development efforts have focused on treating end point pathological markers related to protein aggregation, however, these have all proved unsuccessful so far in the clinic. Our basic understanding of the disease is fundamentally limiting our ability to translate basic research knowledge into drug discovery. In the Gage laboratory, we have developed unique next-generation cellular models for aged neurons to help model the disease. In this volunteer setting, the student will learn the basics of molecular biology and stem cell culture to address the basic biology of aging and AD.

I made that petition to reverse the parking decisions. In under 24 hours, it’s gotten over 3,000 signatures, and more importantly, it’s gotten the attention of a few important players:

1) A UC Advocate (and apparently someone on good terms with Khosla) has reached out to me and promised to speak with him on our behalf already. I am looped into those conversations as they happen. 

2) The Student Transportation Advisory Committee has asked me to come and speak before their panel, and I will be reading off the comments you have all left on the petition. I think the force of 3,000+ students will leave a mark there. 

3) I am in contact with AS, and they have told me the university is potentially going to hold another town hall regarding this issue. If it happens, I think a sizable turnout will make the 783 comments they received last time look like child’s play. 

4) I know of some local organizations (partisan and non-partisan) that are planning on contacting local leaders/standing up for UCSD in the coming days. I’ll update this post as that happens. 

This petition CAN work. We just can’t let it die out. I’m going to keep fighting for this, even behind the scenes, and make sure it gets reversed, because it’s simply a bad policy. 

What I’m asking from all of you: SHARE THIS PETITION. Don’t let it die out. Try to get this on the meme page, too (the admins rejected it originally, but are considering whether or not to put it back on). Imagine what a page with access to 30,000+ students and alumni can do for this. 

I really think this will work. Just keep fighting!

After some back and forth discussion, the San Diego Democratic Party (and its chairman, Will Rodriguez Kennedy) have decided to stand behind the students here at UCSD as we fight to roll back these proposals. 

I understand that this is inherently not a liberal/conservative/political issue, but it’s still very important that local leaders stand with us. We’re really thankful for their support. 

I’m going to continue to call on allies to join the students in this cause. Students have a lot more power than we realize, especially when we keep the pressure on—which is exactly what I plan on doing. 

Here’s a link to their [statement.](https://sdcdp.ngpvanhost.com/media-releases/statement-ucsd-parking-enforcement-changes)

Slightly cloudy but overall a wonderful day in San Diego. The wind was blowing from the east, The sun was moving to the west. Freshmen were putting stuff into their cars at the last minute as they got ready to move out. Crows were picking at the trashbags kept in that giant dumpster on Scholars Drive that always overfills ever year. A few poor suckers were slowly walking to their last finals as they salivated with the thought of freedom. There is something odd in the air this time right at the end of the quarter; Finals are over but the bliss and exhaustion haven't hit you yet. You almost don't know what to do with yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

I finished my last final and was going through my mental checklist before Graduation. I just had to turn in a few documents to ERC Academic Advising, but I would be home-free afterward. I drove to the visitor spaces in the roof of Pangea. Surprisingly there are only a few dozen cars there. Most people probably left as soon as they finished their finals earlier in the week. I parked in a V spot with 3 empty spots to both of my side. I got out of my car. ""If I run to advising and back I should be able to be back in 10 minutes and not have to pay the $3 for an hour-long park."" I bit my lip and thought it over.

&amp;#x200B;

The sun was getting hotter and a decision had to be made. Shakespeare says that hot days get the mad blood stirring. I tend to agree with him; I broke off into a brisk walk to the admin building. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was back in my car after finishing my work. I looked at my watch: 9 minutes had passed. I looked around and saw no parking security. ""I worry too much. Why would they care about a half-empty parking lot? Security has better things to do."" I happily unlocked my car and opened my door. It was then that I saw that dreaded sunflower golden slip. A marigold indictment attached to the windshield of my early 2000s Toyota Corolla. 

&amp;#x200B;

I opened the letter and check the time stamp. Three minutes ago. If I find the issuing officer I might be able to talk to him and explain, what's the worst that could come from just asking? I walked around and caught two parking officers sitting in their air-conditioned smart cars on their phones, blasting music. Good. They seem cool, maybe they will hear me out. I caught them right as they got out of their cars.

&amp;#x200B;

""Excuse me, I just parked my car for 10 minutes to go drop off some graduation paperwork. I know yall are just doing your jobs and I recognize I made a mistake, but I was wondering if there is anything I could do""

&amp;#x200B;

""Noting we can do one it has been issued, but you can appeal it with the instructions in the back of the ticket""

&amp;#x200B;

""Yeah, I just thought I would ask since it's my last day on campus""

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh, are you graduating tomorrow?""

&amp;#x200B;

""Yeah! I was only here to file for my diploma""

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh, well I guess we couldn't let you graduate without one last ticket! :)"" 

&amp;#x200B;

He snickered to himself and walked away. I crawled back to my car and sat in silence as I contemplated my bad life decisions. ""Guess it's going to be rice and beans for dinner for the next week or so""

&amp;#x200B;

An Asian freshman and her dad were packing boxes into their Honda Odyssey across the parking lot. It reminded me of my last day packing after freshman year 3 years ago. My dad and I moved out my stuff together and bonded. We got pizza from Costco afterward. It was Fathers day.

&amp;#x200B;

They eventually left some boxed by their car and walked back to the ResHalls to get more stuff. Then I saw something I could not believe. A parking officer slowly approached the Odyssey.

&amp;#x200B;

 It wasn't even a fight. The car was a sitting duck. 

&amp;#x200B;

After circling the car a few times like a vulture, he started taking photos. He printed a ticket and tucked it into a yellow envelope. He raised the windshield wiper and gingerly slid the ticket onto the windshield. SLAP. The windshield smacked back into place. The envelope crumpled. He walked away with a proud gait; one more student protected. 

&amp;#x200B;

The father-daughter duo approached their van and started tucking their boxes into the car like a jigsaw puzzle. I sat in my car waiting for them to notice the ticket. I thought I could bond with them from afar with a shared misfortune.

&amp;#x200B;

They never did notice. They laughed and went about their work. They never did notice as I started my car and shifted to drive. They never did notice as I drove away and left campus. I thought of what the officer said and shared his amusement. I could not have graduated without getting one last ticket."

I don’t think words could ever really convey just how big this raccoon was but it was THICC in every sense of the word, and I’m talking reminiscent of a bowl of oatmeal type. it was a medical marvel just how big this raccoon was (it was about the size of a small bear) like what the fuck is in the water making that type of satanic shit. anyway not that much of a story just that this was my second time seeing a raccoon in my life, first time was at the village for maybe two seconds, the little guy was cute but this one was from the tenth circle of hell absolutely no doubt in my mind.

https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/af4zc4/wanting_to_di3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app

The panel was intimidating, I had high anxiety and I didn’t even want to look at my professor in the eye. She made me look bad and I blanked out and really didn’t know what to say to defend myself. I don’t think it was fair because she brought up newly found evidence to the hearing that I was not aware of. She also had 2 AI’s on her side. I had my 2 friends involved in the trial but they were only there for like 10 mins then they were dismissed when I feel like they would have helped me in my case. My advocate couldn’t say anything. Also OF COURSE my original advocate I’ve been working with since the beginning of the case emailed me a week before and said he could not attend the panel. I had to make arrangements with a new advocate the week before. Of course I was at a huge disadvantage. My professor also lied during the trial. I’m scared of speaking to authoritative figures so I did not want to argue back with her. 

The main concern the panel kept addressing was WHY the papers were so similar. I HONESTLY SWEAR TO GOD that I have no clue why they ARE similar. That was my “I don’t know” answer throughout the panel. so of course, they would find me responsible to violate the policy. My defense was weak. I don’t know if they even considered reading my long statement. It was mainly focused around my psychotic tutor. Otherwise I never obtained the works of my peers to copy off of. (You know what’s also strange? The quarter after the allegation, my friends notified me that 2 tinder accounts were created impersonating my boyfriend and I asking UCSD students to meet them on campus.) thankfully the accounts got suspended but also what the heck is going on. This makes no sense. I feel so numb. I feel like I’ve done everything just for things to not go in my favor. I’m still waiting for my punishments. It looks like I’ll be facing over a year of suspension or even dismissal. It’s so heart breaking to me, I’ve worked my ass off to go to this school... my dream school. I was full time at my previous college even during summer to transfer into UCSD. I even took like 21 units one semester to make sure I would graduate on time. To my luck right?

I’ll be participating in commencement this Sunday but now I really don’t want to. What have I even accomplished?? Most of my friends and family know about the whole cheating allegation and now I have to tell everyone that I was held responsible. Now I have to wait a year or even more just to take 2 more classes in order to get my degree. I would have to take the same class with the same professor anyways.. I don’t even want to be in the same room as her let alone retake her class! She has caused me and my family immense distress. Man, I even had a job lined up after graduation but I do not have an actual degree yet. What am I going to do? This sucks, as silly as this sounds I really don’t have anymore motivation to finish my degree. My motivation went down the drain the last two quarters. I was stuck in a limbo. Now I’m lost."

Mentally making that switch makes effectively studying for COGS classes even more difficult. Learning how people think, and the complex integration that goes on in our brain, is no easy task.

I feel horrible for those who get falsely accused. Especially because there are so many posts about it. That means there are WAY more getting punished for being innocent/preparing like any other student would irl.

At the same time, I see so many posts about actual cheaters that get away with it. Blatantly enough for others to notice about it, which means there are WAY more who do it and get away irl.

I know our school spirit is nonexistent, and I feel other than clubs, this sub is where many come to shoot the shit, socialize, rant, etc. Basically a form of community.

Now, can we do something about this?

I know an online petition doesn't mean shit, but I'm willing to do something about this with any of you guys who know how to do things like this effectively and address it to the school.

Because most grades are graded on a curve, it's screwing YOU too. Not just by grades but with a higher chance of being accused falsely as an innocent student because the staff knows what's going on to some degree.

Fuck paying all that tuition to barely get by and risking my health to compete with cheaters, who take this opportunity for granted, shitting their parents' AND our money away too, while someone working jobs to pay rent and pursue a dream have to face consequences for your unethical, selfish intentions.

If anyone has any ideas, please post it here.

Shout out to Lavendor(something); maybe the prof was more suspicious about everyone cheating, so anything might've triggered the suspicion because of this bs. Keep your head up.

Allow me to establish some credibility before I go on a rant. I am an incoming freshman with the regent's scholarship, accepted to all the UC's and some prestigious East Coast Schools. I had many, MANY, options, but in the end, I chose UCSD. I will not disclose my test scores and what not because at this point it is irrelevant. 

After lurking in this subreddit for quite a while, I've noticed many people have insecurity issues regarding how this school compares to the other UC's, whether it be acceptance rates, campuses, etc. and it irritates my soul because many really can't see the bigger picture. We are all brothers bound by the same board of regents and should uplift one another's qualities. I want to simply share why I chose UCSD out of all my options and why you, an incoming student should be proud of your choice. 

research- UCSD is globally recognized as a top tier institution PERIOD... the ongoing projects happening at UCSD are truly groundbreaking. I've already met some professors and the seem so dedicated/enthusiastic about their work!

campus- Campus safety is an underrated/overlooked perk at UCSD. Go to USC and you'll come back with a whole nother perspective (I almost got robbed at the LA Memorial Colleseum). I'm not going to start naming the negatives of other UC's campuses out of respect for our BROTHERS but La Jolla is such a nice area and we are lucky to be located there.

Academics- UC Science Department can compete with any UC's stem department any day and we are constantly upping our game in other departments as well. UCSD constantly tries to make professors more accessible such as the coffee with a professor program which I've not really seen anything like it at other top UC's. 

Sports- We have no football team, I have no problem. If you're looking for a school hung up on football, look elsewhere or visit SDSU lol. I do feel inclined to mention though that we are moving to NCAA D1 in a few years. TBH though I didn't pick UCSD based too much on sports XD

Atmosphere- Real chill. Just how I wanted it not some cutthroat/sabotage environment. Another top UC I visited had a negative aura around it along with lots of sabotage stories which honestly seemed crazy to me.

Etc.... I have so many more reasons but I'm lowkey sleepy so I hope you guys could add more reasons, maybe why you guys picked UCSD. I'm simply hoping to change the mentality of the mob here because UCSD is way too good of a school to have this sh\*t associated with it. I'm writing this partially in response to the controversial post, posted by that one entitled student. I promise she's an anomaly, no other regents are like that.

P.S. Quick reminder to my incoming class of '23 this is your new home, be proud, and make sure to build it up. Join clubs, make changes, and make sure to leave UCSD a better place than when you found it so others can enjoy it as much as we will :)"

Reasons were, unsurprisingly, ""no school spirit"", ""dead on weekends"", isolated, close-minded, and some other things that made them not feel any gratefulness or pride to be here.

I say this from the bottom of my heart that I hope this will change one day. I'm not saying this place should be anything that anyone can imagine right now. Just a place that people can be truly grateful to be here and actually feel incredibly lucky enough that you'd see movement in the weekend and school pride, whatever the source of that may be.

If more people acted like this was a target school instead of being  sad and feeling like failure for ending up at a """"""safety school"""""" that'd be enough for me tbh.

I just wanted to keep you updated on what’s going on with public statements (I’ve linked mine in its entirety below). I’ll update this post as we get answers to our questions (answers in parenthesis from here on out). Sorry for poor formatting!

-Here is the statement I prepared — Prior to speaking, we were told for the first time that we would have a 3 minute limit. When I asked if that limit be increased because this is an important issue, I was met with complete silence and told that that counted toward my speaking time. That really left a bad taste in my mouth, and felt disrespectful to student opinions. Anyway (on top of my statement), here are the questions I asked:

1. How many S permits are purchased a year? (Annual permits: 3,250) How many of all Permits purchased? (Annual permits: 6,425)

2. By when do the debts incurred for these structures need to be paid back? (30 year bonds — scale and pace of construction has allowed some 35 year debt assumptions)

3. In the case of option A, by how much would debt payment be set back if you removed the $15 charge from the D, S, and B permits? (“This would not be acceptable to the Administration — about $200,000/year financial impact.”)

4. Can the Transportation Department receive funding from alumni donations? (Yes.)

5. In fall 2020, when sophomores can no longer buy passes, will they also be prevented from buying N/WE passes? (Yes, and can purchase daily parking).


-Two grad students have spoken that they do not come here on the weekends to play. They come to work, and they feel that the alternatives to not take the issues of grad students into account. 

-Rep from Warren College is posting her own alternative on the website.

-Student has a question regarding where exactly the newly raised funds will be allocated. 

-Another grad student re-iterating the point that grad students HAVE to come on the weekends. Took student surveys and is not relating data to the STAC board — 90% of grad students drive on the weekends because of poor bussing. 

-Another grad student speaking on the issue of grad students working every day on the weekend. 

-last speaker discussing how undergrads don’t have reliable income, grad student housing is unaffordable, and this rate hike is only taking advantage of us. Asks if the Department will make their budgets and cash flows available to the public. (Argues that data already released by the Department is a good first step"

cdpz2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/cdpz2o/parking_fee_update_fees_are_back/,Parking Fee Update — Fees Are Back,139,22,2019-07-15 17:42:32,"TL;DR — Weekend Parking Fees are back. Show up to the STAC meeting next Monday (July 22) from 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM on the 4th Floor of PC (Student Governance Chambers) to make your voice heard. Also, read the whole post! It’s long, but understanding the details of this issue is important!

Hi all,

As I mentioned in my last post, the fight to keep weekend parking free is still on. This coming Monday (July 22), new fees will be introduced. Unlike the last ones, they will be dynamic instead of flat-fees. 

This is still unjustified. The Transportation Department, instead of nickleing-and-dimeing students and visitors, needs to find a different revenue stream. 

The good news is that we can still fight back. This time, we need to go a bit further than writing a petition—on Monday, July 22, from 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM, the Student Advisory Transportation Committee (STAC) will be holding an open meeting on the fourth floor of PC (AKA the student governance chamber AKA where AS convenes). If we show up to this and fight back, then we can seriously show the Department we won’t stand for this. 

Here’s what you need to know:

1. Why are these fees being introduced at all? The Transportation Department is losing revenue because the school is in an expansion phase. Fees are being implemented in order to not only pay off debt on Osler, but to pay off expected debt on the new college parking. 

Yes, you read that correctly—if you are graduating next year, you will be paying in order to fund a parking spot you may never even use. 

2. Why will Sophomores be restricted from driving in Fall 2020? In all honesty, I don’t know! What I do know is that when the Transportation Department prevents all Sophomores from purchasing a pass, then ALL Sophomores will be subject to weekend parking fees, thereby increasing revenue streams. 

3. Why is it important we fight back at all? Won’t these fees be small? Sure, they may be small, but to some students, this matters a lot. Income-adverse students (those who probably can’t afford a parking pass anyway) will get hit the hardest by this. Furthermore, any participants in extracurriculars that take place on weekends will now be subject to this fine. Basically, you’ll have to pay to be in certain clubs.

Option A: Weekend parking now requires a ""free virtual permit"", without which you will be ticketed.  If you're not a student, or if you just simply forgot to print one out, you're shit out of luck.  Also accompanied by a 10-20% rate hike.

Option B: Same as option A, except a smaller rate hike, and you only get 10 weekend ""free weekend passes"" per quarter.

Option C: Same as option B, except fewer ""free weekend passes"".

Option D: Essentially their original proposal.  Moderate rate hike, and full fee for parking on weekends.

Obviously, none of us remain students forever (hopefully) but the realization that life keeps moving can hit a little hard. 

I'm here waiting for my job to start after graduation and I'm still browsing this subreddit. I remember getting rekt by all my classes ranging from Chem 6A to MAE senior design from 2015 to now thinking it was never going to end. The joys of looking at your upcoming professor's 1.5 RateMyProf rating and 10 weeks later riding out finals week trying to cram more than your brain was meant to handle. Getting shafted by Sharma's 8-question quizzes, spending endless time on MAE 3's robot project, seeing (and participating in) dance practice mobs in parking garages late at 10:30 PM, and the math professor teaching during the 2016 flood were all vivid memories. I remember a time before the Muir parking lot was destroyed and trolley construction began - a time before Din Tai Fung existed at UTC. 

I recall good and bad memories of each quarter, and each felt like a new stage of life with new hopes and new letdowns compared to the previous quarter.  Now I don't feel like I lived any of these memories because they already seem so distant.  Friends crossed in and out of my life, but by now most have already moved on to start their own lives and it honestly feels like college never happened. This isn't a rant against UCSD or its social life - I was involved in orgs and loved the school, but it felt like life was moving too fast to really appreciate anything after Junior year began. 

Everyone was bound to split off on their own way. It's just crazy to think that people go about their daily lives at UCSD, eventually graduate and move on into other stages of life never to return to being an undergrad. Seeing a new generation of incoming students on triton tours, from the perspective of someone who lived the entire UCSD experience for 4-5 years, blows my mind now knowing what's ahead of them. 

How do some of you earlier graduates feel about this? I don't even know wtf life is anymore and feel like I'm just reacting to whatever happens at this point. No plan whatsoever."

No tomorrow, no tomorrow

Happy birthday, happy birthday
Made to feel the way that every child should

Look right through me, look right through me

Worth reading I promise.,167,46,2019-08-30 19:24:38,"After leaving UCSD in a few days, if someone ever asks me ""How was college?"" My reply would be ""It was the worst time of my life"", and if they repeated the question a second later I'd say ""It was the best time of my life"". Kind of like bits in a computer going 0, 1, 0, 1. But what happened really?

I came to UCSD as a huge weeaboo. No you don't understand. I was the king of weebs. Like, holy shit are you even real, weeb. I literally passed N1 (hardest exam level when I was 16 with no asian ancestry). Crown me the king of nerds. I would know the most obscure stuff of whatever the fuck retarded weeb fuckery, had 0 social skills, and 0 interest in real people. I was playing Persona 5 in 2016 when everyone else was waiting for it (while shitposting on japanese forums). Dude, I was next level nerd.

But when I came to UCSD, I don't know what happened, but I wanted to change. It felt like i've ""beaten"" the anti-social nerd game, or something, and I wanted to become a different person. UCSD was the best place for a moron such as myself, but then I decided I wanted to experience a different life, UCSD was like ""you're in the wrong neighborhood kiddo"". Fuck.

I started a self-improvement road with the same obsession and autism I had learning Japanese when I was 12. I cold-turkey cut all the sugar for months, stopped watching anime, started working out in multiple programs aiming for cardio resistance, muscle building, and explosive strength.

Then I got involved with a group of entrepreneurs to get my head into being ""smart"", and boy, was I not smart. I was like ""bro why are you saying you have dozens eggs when you only have 23"" not smart. And from that self-improvement got me into different lands and parties, and different types of training to communicate and become more interested in other people. I was watching Marvel movies. The me from a year prior would have me beheaded like a savage.

I was hiking every other week even going to LA and do some hiking there. Within 6 months of autistic obsession with workouts I was already good enough to hike Cucamonga peak and did yosemite by the end of that year. I learned swimming and kayaking with some people I met on the web. I went to shows of bands I've never heard of. 

My autism kept me away from girls for awhile though, as I was still a padawan, but after getting buff on 3100 calories 5/3/1 and going on 192 days nofap, with a lot of self-improvement talk I was beyond Jedi and dying to slice. I lost my virginity about a year after I took on the road of change. My testosterone used to be in the low 400, it's in the 900s now.

Honestly I don't think any of this would have happened if I had not come here. UCSD did not provide me with anything I needed to go through this trip, and honestly I think that was for the best. It teaches you to be self-reliant and resourceful in attaining the things you want in life. I suffered a lot though, it was no roses. It was like changing water to wine. A lot of effort and human spirit went into this but I don't regret it at all.

One thing I wish I had found here though: A friend to share this journey with. I have friends that I've met outside the university through parties and my phone and that's not a problem if you're resourceful.

But I really wish I had a pal to learn kayaking with, or to hike with me in LA. Someone to start the journey and continue this journey with. It's not as easy as you'd think. Who would hang out with the guy I started as? And assuming anyone would, how many would be willing to go through all that change, or have the motivation? A lot of people live in the averages, but I experienced the extreme of both nerds and jocks, most of which remain in those extremes and never get out. Not easy to find a nerd willing to explore jockiness of life just like it's not easy to get a jock to explore the weeb/nerd realms.

Which is why I wish UCSD had a proper forum where you better find people you click with. I don't think people being clicky is a problem, I think it's when you can't find your click is when people complain.

Obviously, as a guy who went to both extremes of life I can tell what UCSD supports best, and where it falls flat. Because the campus is so spread out, it's tough to get to know people, even in classrooms is hit or miss, and when you're uh, ""different"", it can be like playing on a casino.

So what do I think would have helped? I'd say if UCSD had a website where guys like me could get on make a discord threads with a theme ""e.g. 'self improvement fury road'"" and find multiple ways to find your click by creating different venues to connect with others, I feel like I'd have found someone to grow with. Might not be exactly the way I was, but we can instantly connect on the one theme of the discord.

A lot of people don't use facebook, and end up missing out on info as well. Having it all centralized would be ideal as heck.

UCSD was a legit unique experience to me. It was like marrying an abusive person and then you become so strong and learn muay thai, jiu jitsu, boxing just to fight his ass. Sure you're a much better person now, but maybe that can be done in a less painful way lol.

Maybe the new moderator can work on something like that and revolutionize campus. A source of resources on ""how to make the best of San Diego and UCSD"". A Megathread to post discords and meetups for certain themes of the kinds of people you'd wanna hang out with. I'd probably contribute too, though, I'm moving to North Cal in a few days for work.

So given the chance I'd probably pick this university again. It was a really weird experience, but I probably would not trade it for anything.

Wish you all the best. San Diego/South Cal. is the shit. Don't take it for granted. Peace."

I just got a letter that I committed a conduct violation and need to set up an appointment with an Associate Dean.

They stayed outside, but peaked inside and saw a few open alcohol containers and red cups. They also found that there was someone under 21 in the apartment (not me).

I had already moved out of this apartment in the morning by turning in my checkout report and was helping my old roommates move out, and did not own the alcohol. I'm not sure if they will care about this though or just allege that I was previously in here so I'm in trouble. I'm not sure if they will pressure me too and try and get my to say something about my old roommates in trouble, otherwise I will be punished.

We were having a great time sitting around, watching Stranger Things while he showed me memes on his camera roll.

Well, on one of the memes he showed me(not that this is relevant) was a photoshopped Tiananmen square meme that was ""Xi jinping approved"" where the tanks were photoshopped out. 

I tried to zoom in on the place were the tanks were supposed to be but I accidentally swiped to the right. The next photo I stared at blankly, like a dying man on his deathbed, absorbing every euclidean detail of what revealed so many questions I had for my horrified friend. He snatched the phone from me and pretended nothing happened, but it was too late. I had already committed that picture to my long term memory where it festers sordidly in my thoughts.

Everytime I access the pallid darkness in my mind's eye I can see that image. Isabel from Animal Crossing suckling on Zero Suit Samus' mammary glands while they were both covered in Metroid sludge, Ridley fucking Christ I can't. 

I've gone through all of the five forsaken stages of grief already. Denying it happened, angry at myself for swiping, bargaining with my psychologist to drill the memory out of my brain, falling into a deep dark depression where I refuse to play Smash Ultimate ever again, and finally, trying to accept it.

I regularly see people posting on the Facebook page asking if anyone has seen their bike or laptop that was stolen on campus. When in reality, it's already been sold in South East San Diego for $20. Also, that the police report they filed was a giant waste of time and will never bring it back. The general population is aware of the inherent innocence displayed by the student population, and a small group of people take full advantage of this.

* If you're studying in a public place (Geisel, Starbucks, etc.) and you get up from your seat, bring your laptop with you. Whether that's the bathroom, getting a drink of water, or sharpening your pencil. If it's going to be out of view, take it with you. Don't rely on a stranger to watch it because they are unlikely to be paying enough attention to anything but their own belongings.
* Don't leave your bike unlocked for any amount of time. I don't care if you're running late for class and think it's fine in the hallway unattended, it legitimately takes 2 seconds for someone to walk off with it, and no one will be paying enough attention to care.
* Don't have your phone out at night while walking around. You're an easy mark for someone to run past and snatch it out of your hands. Also, you should be paying attention to your surrounding at all times when it's dark out anyway. Male or female.
* Don't leave any wires, CDs, etc. visible inside your car. It gives greater cause for a meth head to break in as opposed to the other cars on the block."

But he called UCSD repeatedly last month and was assured that they had received his transcripts and were processing them and not to worry about them. Now they are saying that his admission has been revoked because of missing transcripts? He received ZERO notification that anything was missing at any point and has repeatedly called UCSD just to ensure that nothing was missing. 

It says he has a ""UNMD"" hold on his holds list now. He received no notification of that and we have no idea what UNMD means. He thinks maybe it's because he's in the middle of trying to get a dependency override. He submitted his FAFSA earlier this summer but because his situation has changed he started editing it this week without submitting the changes (but shouldn't the FAFSA he submitted before still be in effect?). 

What can we do now? He's panicking. The offices will be closed on Monday because of the holiday. Is this a glitch? What is going on? Can this be reversed? We don't even understand why they're revoking his admission. It seems so heartless. He received no notification that anything was missing. If we figure out what is supposedly missing will they reverse this? HELP!"

This excludes summer session and part time quarters, and similar to the unit cap, can be appealed with a path towards graduation. As well, they appear to be exempt from the previous 200/230/240 (depending on college and major) unit caps that current students have. 

I'm just curious what the thoughts are on this change. The unit cap was a very imperfect system, but it at least recognized a little bit that some majors require more units, and increased the unit cap accordingly (rip to my fellow ERC engineers, having so many classes our unit cap is 40 higher than most students). The new system doesn't include provisions for this. Really, the colleges should be forced to have similar number of GEs for all majors, but without that, this new system ignores students who require over 200 units to graduate, with over 16 units per quarter as the average. As well, this puts a lot more pressure to graduate in short time, which is intended, but it also pressures students way more."

This all just happened a few hours ago so the terrible feeling of being watched is still fresh. 

I was heading back to UCSD, having just got off the metrolink train at Oceanside station. I'm looking around the signs to see if I can take an Amtrak Pacific surfliner to Solana Beach or a coaster but the earliest one is around 2, It was 12:00 so it would've been too long of a wait. 

""You lost?"" I hear a voice call from behind me. It belonged to a middle aged white man with a very ovalish, nearly bald head, like a pill. He's got greying peach fuzz around, but he smiles very giddily and his voice sounds like those camp counselors when they talk to little children. It's airy, too smooth, and really unsettling. 

I tell him I'm just trying to get to La Jolla. ""Oh do you go to UCSD? I work at the VA medical center there, I used to be a combat vet"". I tell him yeah I'm just trying to get to campus and that I'll probably just take the 101 bus since I don't wanna wait 2 hours. He says ""alright, I'll just catch the coaster at 2. Nice meeting you""

I walk over to the 101 bus station and wait a good 10 minutes. When I get on I see him there, smiling and waving, and patting the seat in front of me to sit down. 

I laugh nervously and ask him why he didn't take the coaster. ""well, I thought it would be too long of a wait and I figured at least I'd have some company"". 

We make some small talk, he asks me about my major, how he likes to mess with computers for fun. He talks about how he served in the Marines in the Phillipines, everytime he laughs about something he puts a hand on my shoulder or pats me on the back. Every touch makes me cringe. 

I try to pretend I'm busy for the rest of the ride, pulling up my phone to read some ebooks. I can feel him staring at my screen, so I keep having to adjust my position away from him. 

When it's finally his stop at the VA he asks if I drink beer. I tell him I'm not 21, which prompts him to laugh and touch my shoulder again. He says to let him buy me a drink when I do turn 21, and that he'll be around UCSD. 

Am I just paranoid? Was he just a friendly guy trying to find a drinking pal? Maybe I'm reading too much into all this, but that two hour bus ride next to him was just absolutely terrifying. It makes me anxious thinking that I might see him again on another bus or around campus considering how close my apartment is to the VA and how all the bus lines run through there."

Hello! I know many of us are scrambling to pick out classes last minute to round out their course-load for the beginning of Fall quarter. To help with this process, I have built a tool to help us make more informed decisions about the courses and professors we choose, by taking advantage of the thousands of student-submitted CAPEs. This tool was developed to better organize the data provided on [cape.ucsd.edu](https://cape.ucsd.edu). The following is a few features to justify the project's name, [BetterCape.com](https://BetterCape.com):

&amp;#x200B;

* Aggregate data -- Combines all similar courses a professor has taught to give a more complete overview of their class.

[For example, our good friend Gary has taught CSE 15L twenty seven times and over those twenty seven courses students have received an average grade of 3.26. Enrolling in a Gary course might be worth it with those stats :O](https://i.redd.it/2f4jzznd0lo31.png)

&amp;#x200B;

* Expand the aggregate data to get a breakdown of all courses.

[Clicking on a row in the table will bring up a modal showing all the courses that make up the aggregate data. Here, by clicking on the Gary row, we can see all of the twenty seven CSE15L courses he has taught, and the stats for each.](https://i.redd.it/pust17zs0lo31.png)

&amp;#x200B;

* Course grouping -- Whereas the order in which UCSD displays the CAPE data is sorted by quarter and lexicographically (causing CSE 100 to come before CSE 11, for example), BetterCape groups courses together by their numeric course code ordering and orders by term within that. This makes searching through a whole department much more intuitive.

[Very readable, incredible.](https://i.redd.it/xarqc9c51lo31.png)

&amp;#x200B;

* Filters! A feature completely missing from traditional capes.

[Here we are searching for upper division courses in the CSE department, taught during the years 2017 up to and including 2019, with an average received GPA of at least 3.5.](https://i.redd.it/qt2tv7ii1lo31.png)

So yeah, if this looks like it would be useful to you, I would love to have you guys check it out. At the very least, I think it is a much cleaner version of UCSD's capes. I would love some feedback from you guys! If this is something I see people are actually using I would definitely like to expand it to do some more interesting analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if this is something you think would be interested in working in, especially for people who are more talented than I with UX / web design definitely lemme know! (Mobile in particular is garbage at the moment)

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck with your Fall quarter everyone, hope this helps!"

1. Set goals for things to get done each day
   1. – Make to-do lists at the beginning of the week (Sunday) for each day of the week – and make sure to complete them
2. If there is reading material, read it before the lesson of that material
3. If professors lecture in a certain outline, take notes in the same way
4. After each class, clean up notes + identify things that were not understood
   1. – take these things to office hours / discussions
   2. – combine lecture notes with reading notes
5. Review notes before a discussion class
6. Keep all loose paper from a class in class folder
7. Turn off phone while studying or keep it away

9. Sleep at least 6h a night and maintain sleep schedule consistent

For those of you not on Facebook, I've been combining several year's worth of student guides as a way to not study for the GRE.  If there's any topics you'd like to be covered that you don't see headers for already, please comment them down below. Also, if you're a current student and have some information/tips you'd like to share, please DM me and I'll add that to the appropriate section, while giving you credit! 

If you have any questions, by some miracle of god or an accounting fluke, I'm a fourth-year nanoengineer in Revelle college. I'm on the board of a few different clubs, have written grants to try and get us chickens (to which I have somewhat succeeded - 7 is more than 0), and am an SD native so if you have any questions on what to do during move-in weekend, I can try to help (if I'm not GRE braindead).

I am a Revelle student recently overflowed so I have never seen one in person before. I thought I could casually walk past them, but when I took a step forward one of them suddenly turned around and stared at me. Its pitch-black beady eyes bore into my soul as I froze dead in my tracks. Still, it proceeded to arch its back, bare its fangs, and lunge at me. Never in my life have I sprinted backwards so fast, even though it was into a parking lot. 

When I left all 10 of them started fighting each other, running up trees, screeching like cats being murdered. It lasted like half an hour. I had never seen such horror come from (what I thought were) such cute creatures. Even though my friend reported the incident to campus police I'm still pretty shaken up. Pair this with the extreme isolation, and 20+ minute walk to get anywhere relevant on campus that comes from being in Sixth, I'm kind of getting sick of it.

I am 28 years young returning student after taking a long break for personal reasons.

I've attended 1 quarter so far and have a hard time making new friends or connecting with people.

It is difficult to build friendships with the younger crowd for various reasons. Putting in effort to get along with the traditional students can come off as creepy, and I doubt the younger students would want an older dude trying so hard to hang out with the hip crowd. Not to mention the vast difference in interests, lifestyles, etc. Nothing against the younger students: I wish I could hang out with anyone regardless of age but it's more complicated than that.

Last quarter has been difficult because I made 0 friends, and it's obvious that they don't feel as comfortable when working on a project with an old dude - understandably so.

I'm not the most proactively social person, but I have no problems connecting with my age group, and having similar experiences to talk about and being an nontraditional student itself is a pretty significant way to relate.

I've seen a post here about older students like myself having a hard social, if one at all. It really sucks.

Would anyone want to meet up and make friends with other non traditional students?

I'm not the best ""leader"" for organizations and such, but I'd be willing to try what I can.

Would anyone be interested? I'd want this to be an all inclusive thing - absolutely no discrimination for ethnicity, religion, major, LGBTQ+, etc. Just don't be an asshole and have a good time - is the only thing I'd expect! Comment if interested! We can make a chat for our group or something. Any suggestions are welcome too!"

But regardless, I’ve noticed a stark difference between UCSD and other colleges in making friends in class. I have a lot of UCR friends and it’s literally the easiest thing for them to strike up a conversation with people in their lectures/labs. They keep these friends and end up hanging outside of class like normal people.

Meanwhile at UCSD, it’s like no one wants to acknowledge each other. And if they do, it’s because they’re forced to or it’s just a question and answer. Take the Physics 1AL  lab series for example. Students don’t even bother to introduce themselves, and only interact to get it all over with. It’s like this in so many classes I’ve seen, and I’m sure it’s not just exclusive to myself.

To be honest, it just feels like UCSD students are so closed off compared to others. I’m sure there are exceptions, like if you actually find a friend group, but think of it. How open have you been to students you have just met in class?"

So other than stockpiling on medicine for such cases, but the food is something I still have no idea on solving yet (Does the campus sell hot soup at any buffets?) I'm also scared of ghosts- I'll feel safe with dormmates, but it's going to be different on nights when my dormmates are out with their friends and I'm alone.

Working at my job is no where near as stressful or difficult as it was at UCSD.",38,21,2019-09-17 16:19:20,"Some of my professors didn’t give a shit about their students, and some put unreasonable expectations onto us. So we had a huge workload with not that much time. A lot of my classes involved self teaching. In that case, what’s the point of taking the class if we’re learning 90% of the content from a book and not a professor?

At work, my questions are answered by many people around me. My bosses and supervisors talk to me with more respect than professors. Expectations are much more realistic. 

At UCSD, when I left my classes, I still felt stressed. I had to go home and study or do time consuming homework. Sometimes I couldn’t relax because I always felt I had to be doing something for those classes. And I felt like this pretty much from week 5-finals week consistently. When I leave work now, even if it’s stressful, I leave the stress behind until I come back the next day. I don’t think about it at home or the weekend. 

I don’t spend 30 minutes a day on just parking/busses at work. 

I don’t have the pressure of not knowing what my grade is compared to the rest of the class and how the curve will be. I don’t need to worry about my education and career being delayed for months based off of one single test. 

At work, it’s clear what I need to know, and what I don’t need to know. I don’t have to attempt to understand 50 things only to be tested on 3 of them. 

People say they think it’s difficult and stressful to work here but honestly these last few months are the least stressed I’ve been in years. 

In no way am I trying to brag or rub it in students’ faces. Maybe I’m just ranting about how I really feel about college. Maybe no one cares about one person’s experience. Maybe other graduates here can relate. Maybe others’ experience is the opposite. Maybe someone here is like me and struggled in college, had a ton of uncertainty about the future and wondered if they’d do alright after graduation"

I know a lot of you are incoming freshmen and are probably very confused about a lot of things here at UCSD. I know I was, there were many things I wish I had done sooner. A little bit about myself first. I recently graduated after I finished my summer session 2 classes a couple weeks ago. I just got my Human Biology degree signed and approved by the Biology Department, that felt really good. It was a long 4+ years. I failed many classes, cried many times, but I also made a great many people, people who I know will be my friends for a long time to come.  I actually still live in the area and I am currently involved as a volunteer at the Food Co-op and the Che Cafe. I joined the Food Co-op middle of Fall quarter of my 4th year. This was the best decision I ever made in my entire college career. I learned a great deal about myself and how to better interact with others, time management, responsibility, communication, etc. Soon after I joined the Che Cafe and got involved in leftist circles, the punk and local DIY music scene, as well as more vegan cooking(i love food). These two places have been the most enriching parts of my life and I would invite everyone to join either one of these 2 cooperatives on campus, there is a lot of great history in these two buildings and they are great opportunities to make friends. I think the best I can tell any of you is to quickly find those spaces with people who you care about and they care about you, it doesn't have to be the Food Coop or the Che, it can be the LGBTQ+ center, Raza Centro, maybe Triton Gaming, or one of the many many clubs at UCSD. I truly believe there is a place in this campus for everyone, it might just take you a while to find it.

Now, for some more ""practical"" advice:

* If you qualify for financial aid, any of the cal or pell grants, do not waive UC Ship. You will pay for it in the first bill but after about a month or so they will refund you for it. If you are unsure, you can go ask the financial aid office, they have always been really helpful to me. 
* If you fail a class, it isn't the end of the world. You can retake up to 16 units, and unless you are double majoring or in engineering/com sci, there is usually a fair amount of flexibility with scheduling. I failed 5 classes and I barely passed this last summer session but I fucking did it, you can do it too. 
* Do not take more than 16-18 units per quarter unless there is really no choice, ideally, 12 units is best, it allows for enough free time to study, work, and/or take care of yourself. I took 4 classes for almost 3 years straight and finally being able to chill out and only take 3 classes a quarter had a big positive impact on my grades and mental health.

If anyone has any questions/would like to talk more with me, feel free to send me a DM or just comment below. I'm sure I can be of some help, I will be around at the Che and the Food Coop a lot once the school year starts. The original student center is my second home.

I'm creating this thread due the the excellent responses I got from the [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/dfzyxu/we_should_do_something_in_solidarity_with_hong/) from yesterday.

Having talked to many people and read all of your posts/PMs I've come up with the beginnings of a plan. I'll detail it here:

\#PHASE 1:

Flyers, chalk and contacting orgs.

The most immediate thing we can do is to start chalking blackboards on campus, handing out/taping up flyers and contacting clubs to try to garner more support. We need three things for this to happen:

1. A design for a flyer, monochrome, in Chinese and English with as few words and as large test as possible.

2. Simple slogans to chalk up, all of us practicing a few Chinese characters would not be a bad idea for this.

3. A template for contacting clubs. We need to come across as organized and professional. Having a well designed template can help with this (although it could also come across as spam, this can be further discussed)

Thanks to /u/Welpmart for this list of clubs to start contacting, if there are any you'd like to add please post them in response:

 [ucsdapsa@gmail.com](mailto:ucsdapsa@gmail.com) (Asian Pacific Islander Student Alliance) 

[cathcom@ucsd.edu](mailto:cathcom@ucsd.edu) (Catholics for Social Justice. Less sure about these guys since their mission is more San Diego-focused, but they might help.) 

[egchrist@ucsd.edu](mailto:egchrist@ucsd.edu) (Model UN. International focus, all about global citizens.) 

[ucsdmasa@gmail.com](mailto:ucsdmasa@gmail.com) (Multi-Asian Student Association) 

[ucsdmsa@gmail.com](mailto:ucsdmsa@gmail.com) (Muslim Student Association) 

[ucsdnsu@gmail.com](mailto:ucsdnsu@gmail.com) (Nikkei Student Union) 

[sjpucsd@gmail.com](mailto:sjpucsd@gmail.com) (Students for Justice in Palestine. I think they'll be sympathetic.) 

[scejucsd@gmail.com](mailto:scejucsd@gmail.com) (Students of Color for Environmental Justice. Like Model UN, not directly connected but might know others.) 

[moa821@gmail.com](mailto:moa821@gmail.com) (Tritons for a Free Press.) 

[y1su@ucsd.edu](mailto:y1su@ucsd.edu) (United Taiwanese Student Association. Directly adjacent to Hong Kong's struggles.) 

[prospectjournal@gmail.com](mailto:prospectjournal@gmail.com) (Journal of International Affairs at UCSD) 

[soarucsd123@gmail.com](mailto:soarucsd123@gmail.com) (Student Organization for Activism and Representation.) 

\#PHASE 2:

T-shirts, facemasks/bandanas and petitions.

Ordering bulk custom clothing is going to take a couple weeks for everything to ship. We also need to come up with designs (I am not a good designer unfortunately).

The clothing should be black with white lettering as a single color will be much cheaper. It should also be related in some way to UCSD, this might force the school administration to respond. Let's come up with slogans in English and Chinese and designs for these items.

Once the shirts/bandanas arrive we should start handing them out in exchange for students signing a petition. This will serve two purposes: 

a) It will prevent people who don't support us from taking clothing and throwing it away (they won't want to sign a petition)

b) Getting more people to sign petitions (like the ones [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/cv0ws4/how_can_you_help_hong_kong_protests_from_abroad/)) is another thing we can do to help the protesters. Contacting our representatives en mass and with petitions could also have a good impact.

I'm willing to fund getting the first batch of clothing myself. The two websites I've looked at so far are [rushordertees](https://www.rushordertees.com/custom/wholesale-t-shirts/) and [vistaprint](https://www.vistaprint.com/?couponAutoload=1&amp;GP=10%2f11%2f2019+10%3a33%3a01&amp;GPS=5500934757&amp;GNF=0). If people know better places I'd love to here them.

\#PHASE 3: 

Semi-permanent displays and protests.

The intention for the first two phases are to raise awareness and gather as much support as possible. I think one of the most effective things we can do is to have a display sanctioned by the school on library walk. It would be illegal to dismantle it and the school would have to openly side with the HK protesters. This may be fairly unrealistic but it should be something we push the school administration on. 

We should be contacting journalists at this stage to explain the schools unwillingness to support Hong Kong, try to bring pressure to bear from every angle at this point.

\#People who have showed interest in supporting this:

/u/GenTelGuy, /u/TixttyTea (please help with design, I'm terrible at it), /u/LiarVonCakely, /u/Deep_Fried_Twinkies, /u/Thundercoco, /u/wdavis6k5, /u/BluEch0, /u/TheRisenDrone, /u/taliacaram, /u/ecstaticstupidity, /u/annapie, /u/hochimintail, /u/ookikeikaku, /u/qwertyqwob2, /u/sasageta, /u/pinkpurplepancakes, /u/mitchetybitchety, /u/Plexiii13, /u/DonJacinto, /u/Typo-Kign, /u/ObliviousOblong, /u/suugami, /u/Kelog13, /u/drcorndog, /u/ImSupposedToBeCoding, /u/Destinesia, /u/typicalmusician, /u/Social_Ascetic, /u/vinzrhche, /u/OGDuckWhisperer, /u/kinnaaan, /u/ThunderCircuit, /u/LaimoCayenne, /u/blueteamcameron, /u/petalsonparchment, /u/N1ghtFeather, /u/boopbbop, /u/JustinWasHere1, /u/ForkMinus1

There are more that I missed and some who PM'd me who I'm not going to post the names of publicly. I'd like to meet in person soon, preferably sometime next week, to get phase 1 started. I'll pay fro mass printing of flyers as well as supplies. When we meet we can coordinate strategies to maximize exposure while minimizing risk to ourselves. I'm free most evenings except for Tuesdays and Thursdays. What we can all do right now is creating templates, start sending messages to clubs and creating designs for shirts and flyers.

If there are any other ideas or suggestions I'd love to hear them, thank you all for your outspoken support!"

The [UCSD Planning, Design and Construction website](http://plandesignbuild.ucsd.edu/projects/seismic.html#Next-Steps) says the following:

&gt;	Once the full evaluation process is completed, it is likely that about half of the buildings that are currently in the “V” category will potentially be given a category “IV” rating which is considered seismic safety policy compliant.

UCSD has already been in the process of retrofitting and replacing buildings, as all UC buildings need to be seismically sound by 2030. This was [one of the reasons](https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/news/regents-to-vote-on-hillcrest-plans/) driving the construction of Jacobs Medical Center, among others. The buildings rated VI (“High Priority for Correction”) are certainly going to be retrofitted soon—there’s already a call for contractors out to renovate and preserve the historically significant Natatorium and Main Gym buildings on the PDC website. I’m not saying not to worry about the seismic ratings—please hold admin accountable at every turn—but do your due diligence as well before talking about lawsuits or buying into panic."

The Chinese government even retaliated against UCSD for the invitation.

Do not fall into the trap of hating Chinese international students. Even the ones who oppose the HK protests are being lied to by their government. More importantly, don't play into that government's hands by brushing this off. They want you to be apathetic so you won't resist next time they reach into your lives.

I think meeting in a central location on campus would be good too so we can spread out easily after the meeting, I'll be in the outdoor eating section of the Price Center (where the fountains and theater entrance are). I have long, curly red hair so I'm hard to miss. I will be bringing flyers and other supplies on the 20th so we can get started immediately.

I also started a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/srDf8ke) to carry out planning and discussion as reddit is not the easiest platform to do this on. If any one wants to volunteer to help moderate please let me know.

Thank you to everyone who responded! I hope to see you there.

Price Center Outdoor eating area (this is picture of the area where I'll be), 5pm on the 20th of October. Look for a short dude with curly red hair.

It's already annoying when you're on time and trying to find a seat, and have to pass by seats ""reserved"" for someone else or put up a fuss to get someone to move their bag (""someone's sitting here"" ""no, they aren't""). But now it seems people are just creating moats around themselves, or have decided that their stuff is too good to sit on the floor where it belongs.

Seeing as I graduated in Spring and am starting at a real job soon, I'm hanging up my hat. It's been an interesting experience seeing how these forums operate. Good work and good luck to our newer mods. I'm excited to check back in (under a new reddit acct) and see what the school's up to.  

Parting advice to /r/UCSD (mod team included :] ) - lighten up y'all! There's a lot of negativity that gets thrown around on social media and if you're not careful you'll end up in a bad mood all day over some shit that doesn't affect you.

On that day a friend in the dungeon dropped  a bombshell on me that most people my first year friend group dont want to associate with me much anymore because of undisclosed reasons, some just avoid eye contact with me altogether. 

That day at 12:01 (gotta make sure I finish my assignments before I lose my shit of course) I just had an enormous mental break down and passed out eventually. I overslept til 1 PM, still did my skincare cause fuck it I'm gonna be late anyway, and took the 41. When it passed by the VA. It was pretty crowded and a lot of the older folks had to stand.

I stood up and asked the elderly gentleman standing next to me if he'd like to take my seat, and a couple of other students around me did the same. He told me I should sit and that he'll be okay. I insisted, telling him my stop was coming up soon. He graciously accepted. 

A few moments later I saw him slip something into my pocket. I was really confused and at first kind of taken aback, not sure what he was doing. I reached in, it was 5 dollars, and a pack of pistachio nuts. 

""Have you eaten yet?""

""No""

He hands me a can of V8 vegetable juice.

""This will get you through the day. I always carry extra snacks just in case.""

It was such a small gesture, but this little bit of kindness really did help me get through the rest of the day physically and mentally. I don't know if he knows how much just sharing his snacks with me helped.

On my transcript there'll be 5 As and 1 D in Math 1B which I guess is MATH 20B for y'all.

I have anxiety/PTSD and have been on antidepressants for about a year. I didn't do well in Math 20B despite studying for 200 hours throughout the quarter because I needed more time to finish the exams. I conceptually understood the material and knew how to solve the problem, but needed more time because of my fight or flight response. I know I would have passed the class had I had more time on the final because I knew how to do the problems but didn't have time to do them. 40 questions in 2 hours, multiple choice with no partial credit. Obviously not having partial credit deflates grades. 

Not sure how this will affect admission to UCSD but it's looking bad for sure.

As health and safety are our first priority, we are taking actions to significantly increase social distance on our campus:

**HOUSING**

* To lower the density on campus, we are strongly urging students who can safely leave to do so as soon as feasible, but no later than March 29. This will allow the remaining students who are not able to leave campus the recommended space for effective social distancing.
* Students should consider living on campus during the Spring Quarter only if they satisfy at least one of the following conditions: those who are without access to stable housing; who come from housing/food insecure households; who are unable to travel home; who are from areas highly impacted by COVID-19 or regions at risk for a COVID-19 outbreak; who are unable to relocate without high risk to their safety; and those who would be relocating to homes that lack infrastructure to accommodate virtual instruction.
* Students who notify Housing, Dining &amp; Hospitality of their intention to move out and turn in their keys before March 29 will receive a full refund for Spring Quarter housing costs. Information can be found on the [Housing, Dining &amp; Hospitality website](http://hdh.ucsd.edu/). 

**SPRING QUARTER INSTRUCTION UPDATE**

* Spring Quarter instruction will commence on March 30, as originally scheduled. To reduce anxiety and demonstrate compassion for our students, we strongly recommend that faculty consider the following for the first week of instruction: (a) taking measures to help students familiarize themselves with the remote instruction tools for the course, (b) making review and introductory material available via other methods, such as email or Google docs, so students joining the course late can catch up, and (c) refraining from having assignments or assessments due that week.
* To further enhance opportunities for social distancing, ALL UC San Diego courses will be offered remotely for the entire Spring Quarter, including laboratories, studio classes, small group discussions and seminars. There will be no exceptions. Students will participate in all courses remotely, regardless of where they reside."

""As you know, our nation is facing an unprecedented health crisis because of the spread of COVID-19. Everyone at UC San Diego is committed to protecting the health of all of our students and residents by closely following all recommendations and guidelines from County, State, and Federal public health officials.

""Knowing that San Diego now has low levels of community spread of Covid-19, we have taken steps per public health guidelines to provide appropriate isolation housing on campus for students who are undergoing testing and awaiting results.

""As part of our commitment to following public health guidance, we have arranged for certain, single, private rooms to house students and residents for whom there may be concerns about their health. The students and residents who are placed in those rooms will be directed to stay in their rooms. All meals will be brought to them, and medical personnel will regularly check on their health.

""Isolating an individual of concern in a private room is the best practice recommended by public health officials worldwide. COVID-19 is only transmitted by direct contact. It is not transmitted by air. The isolated students will stay in their rooms and should have no contact with any residents of the building. There should be no possibility of other residents contracting COVID-19 from these students.

""We understand that this is a challenging time, so now more than ever we must rely on the best science and medical knowledge available. Proactively and quickly moving persons of concern to places of social isolation is the best way medical science knows to protect the community at this time.

""We appreciate your support and understanding of everyone’s efforts to deal with this difficult situation. The respect and commitment to each other’s well-being is one of the attributes that embodies the Principals of Community at UC San Diego. Your continuing compassion and empathy will make a tangible difference on our campus. 

""In this critical time, people should follow the safety steps recommended by public health officials, including:

- Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
- Stay home when you are sick.

- It can take up to 24 hours for courses to appear on Canvas. If you can't locate a course, try checking under ""All Courses"" (linked on the Canvas Dashboard) to see if it is unpublished. If it is, the professor has yet to publish it. Otherwise, **contact the ITS Service Desk by going to the [UCSD ITS Service Portal](https://servicedesk.ucsd.edu), by emailing servicedesk@ucsd.edu, or by calling (858) 246-4357.**
- In addition, we are no longer allowing Zoom links to be requested or posted on r/UCSD. We've been getting a lot of reports of these links being misused, **so for future questions on how to access Zoom lectures, please contact ITS (as shown above) or contact your professor for assistance.**

We understand that there's a lot of confusion and worry going around at the moment, but it's times like these when staying calm and keeping a cool head helps the most. This quarter will take some adjusting, but the adjustment period will end soon.

""As you know, our nation is facing an unprecedented health crisis because of the spread of COVID-19. Everyone at UC San Diego is committed to protecting the health of all of our students and residents by closely following all recommendations and guidelines from County, State, and Federal public health officials.

""Knowing that San Diego now has low levels of community spread of Covid-19, we have taken steps per public health guidelines to provide appropriate isolation housing on campus for students who are undergoing testing and awaiting results.

""As part of our commitment to following public health guidance, we have arranged for certain, single, private rooms to house students and residents for whom there may be concerns about their health. The students and residents who are placed in those rooms will be directed to stay in their rooms. All meals will be brought to them, and medical personnel will regularly check on their health.

""Isolating an individual of concern in a private room is the best practice recommended by public health officials worldwide. COVID-19 is only transmitted by direct contact. It is not transmitted by air. The isolated students will stay in their rooms and should have no contact with any residents of the building. There should be no possibility of other residents contracting COVID-19 from these students.

""We understand that this is a challenging time, so now more than ever we must rely on the best science and medical knowledge available. Proactively and quickly moving persons of concern to places of social isolation is the best way medical science knows to protect the community at this time.

San Diego County's public health order, which included nine mandates and three strong recommendations, was meant to slow the spread. The following orders were issued:

2. All non-essential gatherings of any size are strongly discouraged
3. Establishments that serve alcohol but no food are ordered to close. Restaurants must close all on-site dining, though odering for pick up or drive-thru will still be allowed
4. All businesses should enact social distancing and should use telecommuting when possible. Businesses that use policies requiring doctor’s notes for sick days should terminate the practice immediately
5. Parents should ensure that their children are following \[what I am not sure - this is cut and pasted from the article which hopefully will get updated\]
6. The County urges anyone age 65 years or older and those with underlying health issues to self-isolate
7. Non-essential personnel are prohibited from entering hospitals or long-term care facilities
8. Hospitals and healthcare should take measures to preserve resources including delaying nonemergency procedures where feasible

I‘ve seen a lot of people posting about financial aid and housing contact cancellations along with how they’re being charge x amount. I wanted to provide as much information as I can from what I learned through emailing the different departments. I hope this post helps and makes everyone’s worries slightly less. I understand that the waiting is stressful, I still haven’t gotten my refund, but I wanted to share what I know since usually I just reply to posts. 

First thing, when will I get my refund? 

As of April 1st HDH sent out an email stating that it could take up to 4-5 weeks to get the refund. They stated that it is an on going process meaning that I could take as long as 5 weeks or even less depend on when they get to your case. The refunds are individually done so there are no errors. So, if some people get theirs earlier it is due to the fact that it goes in order, what order I can’t say because I didn’t ask. 

What’s the process like for the refund? 

First,  financial aid will make any needed adjustments. Next, the spring housing charge will be reversed.  Finally, any dining plan charges or refunds will post to the student account. Each account will be manually adjusted so we expect the process to take 4-5 weeks.

What will my refund show up as in my billing statement? 

“SP20 HSG RM+DINING CREDIT” 

What should I know about dining dollars? 

Keep in mind that the charge for housing includes dining dollars per quarter. So usually, depending on how you split it, it will be different. In my case, I receive financial so I do my billing statement by quarter. 
So for each quarter HDH adds the housing charge (your rent for room size) plus the divided amount of dining dollars (which plan you have) and combines it into one charge. 
Hence when you have any underspent dining dollars you would get a refund for it or if you over spent you would get charged for the amount. Since the amount allotted for the quarter is already in the original charge that doesn’t show up in a separate refund or charge. If you get refund for dining dollars (underspent) you would get a credit to your account. Any overspent dining dollars you would get a charge for it. 

This is the information I received from HDH for how they divide the dining dollars for spring quarter... 

$1700 total dining plan/spring allowance is $555
$3400 total dining plan/spring allowance is $1109
$5100 total dining plan/spring allowance is $1664

Now, here’s an example that HDH gave to me so it’s easier to understand... 

Example: if the academic year dining plan total is $3400, the student will want to leave $1109 (spring allowance) remaining in the dining dollars balance at the end of winter quarter. If the student uses any of the $1109 spring allowance, the student account would be charged for over usage. However, if the dining dollar remaining balance is $1209, the student would be refunded $100.

Can I check my dining dollars balance or know what I had? 

Unfortunately the reply I received was, “Sorry, there is not a way to check as the process is still ongoing so the dining dollar accounts were closed. Amounts need to be calculated for thousands of students.” 

UPDATE fill out the help form on card services website and you can ask for them to tell you your balance of dining dollars before account was closed!!!

Why am I being charged for ex) UCSD grant, etc? 

When you look at your current billing statement you might be charge for the grant in aid, your loan or any other type of financial aid that you had. In this case, I want you to look at your unpaid transactions. If it says “insert housing charge here” you shouldn’t have to worry about it because if you are being refunded because you moved out there are no late fees. 
Also as HDH said, “Students who will not be living on campus for Spring Quarter and cancel their 2019-2020 housing contract by March 29, 2020, will have Spring Quarter housing and dining charges adjusted. Please note: since students will not be paying for the spring housing/dining charge, they should not use the spring dining dollars allowance. Housing and dining is charged together.” 
Meaning nothing negative will happen to you if you are being refunded for the full amount. 

Please take a look at your financial page for 2019-2020! 

Now if you have any adjustments to accept, accept them as soon as possible. The financial aid department can adjust it quicker and then it will speed up the process to get to the next step of the process (refer to steps at top of post). If financial aid has reduce any of your aid you want to accept it because that also helps you know of the aid you will be receiving. 

If I have loans is there anything that I need to do if financial aid changes them? 

The simple answer is no. The only thing you need to do is make sure you click yes to accept all your new aid and financial aid will refund the portion of loans unused and contact the loan servicer for you to update the balance you have on your loans. 

How much should I expect for my refund? 

Now that varies from person to person, but from the calculations that I’ve been doing I’ll share them with you. So I took all of aid that I am receiving and added it together. On the current billing statement it should show you charges for aid you aren’t receiving and I subtracted that. I subtracted the tuition ands fees and any other things that appear on my statement. I added another charge of what I think I might have over spent possibly on dining dollars (because I don’t remember if I did) and that’s what I believe should be my refund. Keep in mind I’m not sure if this is what my refund would be for sure but it’s how much I estimate it to be at. 

So, that being said if you come out with a balance of it being positive that means you will likely get a refund (don’t quote me because this is just based one common sense that I calculated it... I could be wrong but based on the process I believe it is right.) 

If you come up with a negative balance, more than likely this is what you would owe. 

How will I know when my refund is available? 

HDH told me, “Students will be emailed when the adjustments are complete.” Or you could check your tritonlink page for updates. 

If you have any inquires based on balance etc, I recommend you contact financial aid by email. At most wait five days and if they don’t respond reply to your email and usually they will respond then. I’ve noticed it’s better to do it at the beginning of their hours to get answers from them. 

Also if you’ve received your refund feel free to explain your process if you feel comfortable with it because it might ease the worries of others. 

Once again I hope this post helps and sorry that it is really long, I just wanted to comment on the various questions I’ve seen."

I recently got into UCSD for human bio and I wanted to know a little more about the overall diversity on the UCSD campus, specifically from the perspective of the students. Before I ask the general question, I feel like I should give an overall background of myself, which is basically the reason why I am asking in the first place. As of now, I am the only person with black backgrounds in my graduating class. Sadly, I didn't have the best experience with this. Because I am one of few minorities at my school, I experienced a lot of forms of oppression from my peers (i.e., micro-agression, discreet racism, direct racism). I don't want to go through this again in college, so I'm asking the general question: How is the diversity and cultural acceptance at UCSD, as of terms for a black student? Please do not feel uncomfortable to answer my question :)"

1. Everyone should maintain social distancing right now.
2. If I'm being completely honest, this post is 70% me looking for a relationship. (This isn't a personal, though)

With those two out of the way, I'm gonna get to the meat of this post. I'm a sophomore guy here on campus, and I'm kinda stuck here at UCSD. I'm fairly sure there's about two thousand of us scattered around campus, and every day I go out to hike I see maybe ten to twenty. Frankly, I know we're all missing the feeling of going to classes, and missing the social connection that regular life gave us, and it's starting to hit me a little. I'm lucky enough that I have three good friends still here on campus with me, and we can still see each other from time to time, but I'm not so sure that everyone has that same luck. 

I want to get to know people again, I want to reach out and say, ""Hey, I'm \[my name\], what's your name? What's your story, what're your interests? Tell me about you."" More than that, I want to be someone who can support other people around me socially, someone you can rely on to chat with and hang out with (once the virus dies down, of course). Considering the [recent announcement from the governor's office](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/04/14/governor-newsom-outlines-six-critical-indicators-the-state-will-consider-before-modifying-the-stay-at-home-order-and-other-covid-19-interventions/), I'd wager that things could actually start going that way sooner than we think. Regardless of that, though, I know I can't be the only one who's feeling the isolation blues here on campus, and if anyone's browsing this and feeling the same, or knows someone who is, please reach out!"

This isn't that big of an issue - because I have access to the email, I can change all of tyler's old passwords I do not know.

*Allow me to get right to the point.* Every one of us attending UCSD now pays over $200 each and every year to Associated Students, our student government. We believe that that money shouldn’t be [wasted](https://as.ucsd.edu/DownloadDocument?id=174&amp;view=True) on propping up a bloated bureaucracy that spends tens (if not hundreds) of thousands of dollars on meaningless things that don’t benefit you in any way, like ‘Leadership Development’ or ‘Retreats’, and then holds the occasional gimmicky event to give off the impression of progress and development.

Instead, it should be spent on lasting improvements to mental health provision and easing the burden off CAPS, fighting food insecurity by streamlining the food pantry and making it more efficient, creating an artistic and creative culture that is so desperately lacking here, promoting creative expression, among other things.

Campaigns and candidates who spend *their own* money in [this](https://ucsdguardian.org/2020/05/16/letter-to-the-editor-take-bold-action-to-support-students-instead-of-celebritys-bank-accounts/) [way](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pRGJyTvBL7WBu3VYW04uBPATRGF4PvNEjtad-daHosc/edit#gid=0) **cannot be trusted** to spend *your* money wisely. Top level candidates who *allegedly* formed their slates in this way and have plans such as [these](https://ucsdguardian.org/2020/02/17/as-senators-allege-attempted-abuse-of-power-ahead-of-election/) have **absolutely** no place in our student government.

Instead, we ought to elect people who abide by democratic norms, who have done everything in the public eye, who have fresh perspectives and real ideas on what ought to be done, and who believe that good governance can only come from a strong transparent democracy where the people are supreme and well-informed and the leaders respect the people and their representatives.

As it is now, **AS is completely and utterly broken and those who have played a role in creating that waste and those who continue supporting this system.** If it is to ever become a force for real progress, **we must change its course** ***now***.

And we are the team to do just that. We are a group of four Tritons with fresh perspectives and real pragmatic [policies](https://www.forwardtritons.com/our-platform) that will truly make life better for all Tritons. We are the change AS and this campus in general so desperately needs. We are beyond ready to serve you and lead all of us to prosperity and happiness. **We are the only way Forward!**

And **we will be hosting an AMA this Monday night at 8 PM**, immediately following the AS Election Committee’s presidential and vice presidential debates on that will be live-streamed [here](https://www.facebook.com/ASUCSD). Myself, my co-founder and VP of Campus Affairs candidate **Sam Fleet** and campus-wide senatorial candidates **James Callahan** and **Phoenix Stout** will all be answering questions from all of you here on [r/UCSD](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/) as well as from folks on Facebook and over Zoom (Room ID 918 1985 1530).

The director of the Humanities Program recently finalized the measures to evaluate participation credit for the 2020 Spring quarter and summer sessions (so PLEASE follow the instructions given to you and make our lives that much more easier). This applies to all discussions starting week 1, and a brief description is as follows. We are required to download and parse the HTML files of the discussion threads with a bash script emailed to us that 1) checks for the word count of each individual post/reply and 2) pipes them into Turnitin to evaluate for plagiarism. Authors of posts that test positive for plagiarism will be marked for an academic integrity violation and are subject for further investigation. Posts that do not pass these preliminary measures will not be considered for credit. Finally, TA’s are advised to physically read through the discussion thread to further sift out any unsatisfactory posts. Posts that are off topic, do not seem to contain original thought, or (if it is a reply to another student’s post) do not build substantially on their ideas will receive a reduced grade completely up to the TA’s discretion based on an unreleased rubric. This is all done, in hope, that the quality of your education is not jeopardized in these unprecedented circumstances. Sincerely, this is just a joke and i’m not ur ta."

I currently go to UCR and I’m transferring to UCSD this fall as a third year gen bio major. I’ve been skimming through this subreddit for a while and i noticed that a lot of students say that they don’t really do anything during their free time except study. 

Is the rigor/ workload really that much harder? I’ve never had to study every day for classes throughout my college experience and I do fine. Usually there’s time for other stuff even though there are assignments and tasks that I need to complete. I can’t imagine studying every day for hours to do well in my classes (I would lose it studying is all I did) Is that really what it’ll be like come fall? I’ll be taking upper divs so I’m sure they’ll be harder but more enjoyable?!? lol

gkfbsk,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/gkfbsk/general_consensus_regarding_pnp/,General consensus regarding P/NP?,4,15,2020-05-15 12:06:10,"Now that the quarter is nearing the end and we're all delirious from midterms/essays/projects I wanted to ask around for the general opinion regarding P/NP, specifically for those who are planning to apply to grad school. After reading a plethora of threads, I've sorted the general mindset into 3 categories:

&amp;#x200B;

i) P/NP everything- all grad schools are well aware of the impact of COVID 19 and have implemented some sort of pass/fail grading option for the undergrads at their institution as well. Also, blanket P/NP doesn't suggest you're trying to boost your GPA by taking some courses for a letter and some for the P. Also, if a school lacks common human decency and decides to hold a ""P"" vs a letter against you during a pandemic, you probably don't want to go there anyway. 

&amp;#x200B;

ii) Take everything for a letter. Better safe than sorry- a ""B"" is definitive whereas opting for a ""P"" instead of a letter gives room for adcoms to wonder if you got a C- or above. (obviously if you're gettin straight A's then you're probably not getting much from this thread, bc there's literally no reason you'd choose a ""P"" over an ""A"").

&amp;#x200B;

iii) Taking any course which would lower my current GPA for a ""P"", and keeping the rest for a letter. Again, grad schools will most likely overlook grades from this quarter and won't look too deeply into ""P."" Why bring GPA down unnecessarily? 

&amp;#x200B;

What are your general thoughts? I'm still thinking about what I'm going to do myself, since anything lower than an A- will hurt my GPA significantly, specifically I'm thinking of taking 1 major class for a ""P"" and the rest for a letter- but I don't want to be shooting myself in the foot. I've talked to some friends since I'm not super familiar with how P/NP grades are viewed, and their opinions are widely varying as well."

gosl5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/gosl5i/some_scary_implications_regarding_international/,Some scary implications regarding International Students for this Fall and beyond,3,22,2020-05-22 14:48:42,"This is something that I discussed the other night with my dad. He talked to me the other night how he expected the amount of international students from Asia (not just China) to decrease this upcoming fall, due to the current corona virus crisis. Not just from the health concerns but also from the underlying racism that often gets shun over that a lot of people might not realize. 

While this article is about an international student in the United Kingdom, I think it can still apply to my point that the underlying racism is present in society.

[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-51722686](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-51722686)

tl:dr of the article: A Singaporean international student in the UK got beaten up due to the fact that someone accused him of bringing Coronavirus into the country.

While I certainly hope that this is an isolated case, there is no doubt that news like this may deter Asian students from coming here to the US to study. (The reason, why I said Asian and not Chinese is simply that I don't think racist people would care, you look the slightest bit of Chinese than you are Chinese to them.)

Some of you might not be aware of this, but international students usually pay around three times as much as in state students (roughly $15.5k per quarter), and they are clearly a very valuable asset to colleges in the US such as UCSD (just take a walk around down Library Walk and count how many Chinese students there are in this campus). This video also shows that it is not a California specific phenomenon [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVCEvx8JCTQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVCEvx8JCTQ)

According to said video, even the University of Illinois had also went as far to take on an insurance policy of $424,000 in case they saw a decline in the amount of Chinese International students coming to the US to study. Which just shows how much US colleges have relied on the tuition fees that international students have to pay.

Why is this an issue to us? You might ask? Well it is a snowball effect from here. Less international students -&gt; Less funding -&gt; School cannot hire more faculty due to decreased funding, and cannot build new buildings for its students -&gt; decrease in the quality of education -&gt; Would be harder to find a job, as employers might even be more willing to outsource their work abroad given how efficient Zoom has been in the work space. -&gt; decline in economy.

So I just brought up this issue, as I believe it is not just a concern for me.

tl:dr - Coronavirus might lead to a decrease in international students this fall, due to how some Asian students might fear their safety, which can mean that there will be less funding for our school.

Disclaimer: I am Asian."

If they have to provide an online option for required courses, they may then argue that the professors can't do online and in-person concurrently and that they don't want to increase the number of sections/professors to teach a particular subject...

So to the question: How is fall going to affect the remainder of the year?"

It has been rough this quarter and I really don't want this again. And I imagine I'm not the only one who is feeling this way. I imagine the mental health of students hasn't even been in consideration in their discussion of what to do because mental health is always just pushed to the side and deemed less important. With such a low rate of mortality in this age range, the true coronavirus hit to this group will be mental health.

I originally had some hope with the return to learn program but now I don't even understand the point if we aren't returning. I'm not even afraid of the virus...I'd sooner take that and just get over it than continue living like this. I can't get away from this bleak outlook of the future.

Would it be difficult to just move back during a later quarter ? 

For people living on campus: HDH has said that if you don’t move back during the Fall, then it’s not guaranteed you’ll have housing for Winter or Spring (even if you have a housing guarantee.) That worries me because although it’s possible for me to take all my classes remotely for Fall 2020, that might not be the case for the other quarters, so I don’t want to risk losing housing for the entire year. Are y’all willing to risk it and just apply for the waitlist in the Winter/Spring ?"

Turns out they charge a ridiculous amount for just a few items and that’s not cool. I offered to go clean out his room for him since I would hate to be in his situation, and I did just that. I’m right by campus so I went and cleaned out his stuff.

I got a few private messages from others asking if I could do the same for them and I gladly will. So if anyone has left campus and planned to come back so you left a few things behind but never actually returned, let me know and I’ll go and clean out your room for you so you don’t end up with a $300+ charge for room cleaning on your student account. Cause in my opinion this school is already stealing from us enough!

You gotta always look on the bright side of things, and acknowledge whatever struggles you were going through in whatever context to get a bigger sense of the big picture situation. My first quarter this year--being a first-year--I got put under academic probation for having done so badly in my classes. I consider myself unofficially first-gen (as I was the first of my siblings to go to four-year, but both my parents had higher education in Mexico; however they are currently not even living with me to aide me in any support they might've been), and a part of me wishes I had just said I was on my application because I now know first-gen students get so many resources for their first year that would've helped me out so much. I didn't know what I was doing and not having that support from what felt like anyone really let me get overwhelmed. I was also going through so many other things with my social life and unknowingly working way too many hours, and it just got too much too fast. 

It was really hard for me to adjust having felt like I went into the deep end thinking I knew how to swim, but in actuality, I drowned. Like I said though, I took it as a learning experience and ultimately did a lot better second quarter, and now third quarter around I'm doing even better. Having said that though, it hadn't hit me that my overall cumulative GPA might not entirely reflect the last two-quarters of hard-work and improvement I had displayed. 

Having calculated my overall GPA now, I see it's only at around 2.73, and that sucks. :( 

I understand college is far from high school grades, but having come from having one of the highest GPA's in my high school, which in turn aided in my acceptance here, to being diminished to a below 3.0 GPA can be a little more than just disheartening. I know grades don't define you, but when they sort of did for so long, and you see such a low, feeble little number staring back at you, at the end of your first-year at such a great school, especially knowing that the profession I want to go into is literally medicine, the one that could arguably care the MOST about GPA's and grades.... 

Sufficient to say guys, I'm a little sad! LOL I'm a little disappointed in myself that I would fall so far down. But, in all honesty, I'm really just trying to focus on the positives, accept that I can't change the past, and just try to keep moving forward and being better. I just wanted to let this out on here and hopefully gather some uplifting and useful advice or tips for future studying or helping move forward with a class you maybe didn't do so hot on. Anything helps! 

Thanks for hearing me out!"

As someone who understands what you're going through, I hope you know that I'm rooting for you this week. You have one final push before this quarter is over, and that is something you should be proud of. Wherever you are, take a step back and breathe.

Please do not refer to UC San Diego as ""UCSD."" This is not the proper way to refer to the University of California's seventh and flagship campus. University of California, San Diego or UC San Diego are all proper and acceptable ways to say it. UCSD, on the other hand, is not.
As the system's most prestigious and respected campus, we feel that it is important to honor and maintain an appropriate level of respect for our university's name. We feel that ""UCSD"" cheapens our brand and doesn't emphasize the incredible prestige associated with UC San Diego.
While it may be acceptable to refer to all other UC campuses in initialisms due to their lack of recognition and prestige, this is not acceptable for the flagship and most well-known campus, and we therefore request that you cease using the name ""UCSD"" to refer our school. Thank you.

Don't say ""UCSD"" when referring to UC San Diego."

Our grade is only based on three exams, so it’s not like I could have committed a violation during the final since I didn’t even take it. As for midterms 1 and 2, I didn’t commit any violations and to support that, I received nonzero scores for both midterms and no one reached out to me after either midterm saying that I was suspected of something. I know other students who were reached out to directly after the midterms, so that leads me to believe there’s no issue with the midterms either. I emailed her, but no response. Not sure what to do.

I got into a cancer research lab in mid winter quarter, only spent about 4 weeks there, probably finishing 1/3 of my training or less, and then boom nope you cant go to lab anymore. I don’t think my lab will open for undergrads at all for rest of summer according to what i am hearing (theres already lots of people working there daily so they dont want it to be too crowded i think). So thats great, and the way things are going now who knows if it will open in fall. I have some friends who are able to go into their labs. I know a lot of you have worse things on your plate likely, but I just wanted to vent about this to see if anyone can relate. I am kind of surprised i have not seen anyone bring up this concern yet (or i have just missed that post). I may try and reach out to some other labs to see if they are open and need help though i dont have too much hope for that. 

It’s so strange to come to UCSD hoping and being optimistic about my future to have it crashing down and feeling like everything is on pause. Unlike freshmen, i only have one year left so even if my lab did open up next winter or spring thats not very much experience and I would never finish training probably..... Either way I may end up taking a break from UCSD after fall if things dont start changing because lab classes online ??? No research lab?? What am I paying for ??"

So I’m the UAW 2865 Bargaining Rep for UCSB (the union representing TAs, Tutors, and Readers) and as a part of my duties, I have been meeting a lot with UCOP surrounding coronavirus issues and campus reopening. Honestly, through participating in these conversations, I have gradually begun having bleaker views on the fall reopening situation with UCOP having no idea on what is happening.

**Tl;DR: There is no standardized COVID testing, cleaning, or contract tracing protocols. UCOP wants to keep tuition fees, and housing costs the same.**

I thought it would be helpful to share some of the rough transcripts of conversations that we’ve had with UCOP about campus reopenings in the past week. I have edited these conversations for brevity and taken out repetitive / overly specific contract information (e.g. Conversations about the ICE order that got repealed or childcare contract provisions). Hopefully, this will enlighten everyone more on our collective situation surrounding campus reopenings as many of these situations apply to the entire campus population, not just union members.

If anyone wants to attend these meetings, the bargaining sessions are open to the public (unfortunately, I think the UC-Union meeting is closed). I would highly encourage everyone to observe the lecturer bargaining session where the UC is attempting to limit their job security. If you want any of these links feel free to DM me.

**UAW 2865 (Academic Student Employees) and UAW 5810 (Postdocs + Academic Researchers) Bargaining Session on July 8th.**

**Yunyi (UAW 2865 Representative):** What’s the status for waiving parking fees?

**Nadine Fishel (UCOP Labor Relations Chief Negotiator):** Nothing is changing from our current policies.

…

**Dylan (UAW 2865 Representative):** As you \[UCOP\] know, we are demanding that the university remit campus-based fees for the operating costs. We see no reason that ASEs should be paying gym fees when they are not able to go to the gym. Who is responsible for remitting these fees?

**TLDR: We looked and tried; No campus Fees can be refunded.**

**Nadine Fishel:** I think the situation with the campus fees when we started talking about it was absolutely up to campuses to decide and over time locations unanimously said there are only some fees that could be dealt with, the ones that come to mind are parking which aren’t part of campus fees, but parking as you know has been changed over time. The problem with the campus fees and we all understand that you can’t go into a gym because you don’t feel it’s an appropriate venue, then why are you paying for it? But the problem is that that campus fees are the only source of revenue they have. The Regents did make the decision that the fees associated with going to school at UC would remain regardless of in-person or online instruction. This may seem odd because this came about because there was little that could be done on true campus fee pieces with the exception of parking, which is a campus fee but not a campus-based fee. Certainly not what we see as campus fees. There was a metamorphosis on this issue. The individual campuses looked at each of these fees with the understanding that it would be great to give a fee back, at the end of the day there was no other way to support the services of that function long-term or the fact that some of those fees are anticipated to pay for a facility long-term. For example, the Berkeley student center, they didn’t base rebuilding of the student center on current fees of students there. They based it on amortization of fees from students over many years. Not having that funding wouldn’t work bc there is no other place to get that funding. We understand and convey your concerns. The decisions that came down were considered decisions by those who have the authority to determine who buildings or other programs could be funded.

**Dylan:** Just to be clear, when we’re talking about remitting campus fees, we understand that local bonds assessed are a part of that fee, but operations costs is the area that we are focusing on. Even though there is very little operation at the gym at UCSB, the funding for those costs has been unchanged. **Where are these campus fees going if they are not supporting regular operating costs?**

**Nadine Fishel:** I don’t have an answer to that but I will absolutely find out, and it’s a very fair question to ask for funds that are ear-marked for certain things. We don’t currently know.

… \[There was a lot of stuff on reopening that they basically said nothing to and is more clearly discussed later in post\]

**Yunyi:** Is there some health and safety guidance being given by UCOP to the campuses?

**Nadine Fishel:** As I suggested earlier the environmental health and safety given by UCOP as well as every campus as well as UC Health there is a lot of discussions going on between those groups about what actually can be done, but the solutions may be different based on the counties’ protocols that they have in place.

...

**Mai (UAW 2865 Rank-and-file):** In the middle of June, Riverside announced reopening guidance. Regarding hiring protocol for in-person courses, we are worried about discrimination. Instructors are instructed to solicit willingness to TA in person, which means that the TAs willing to come to campus will be preferred because they are a caregiver or worried about health and safety. **There also don’t seem to be any details about health standards for these hiring protocols.** The maximum for students in lab sections is 30, which is already the max cap, meaning ASEs wouldn’t be seeing reductions in students in their classes, which is concerning.

**TL;DR: Asking students if they're willing to TA on campus isn't ""discriminatory"" to people who are unable to do that for whatever COVID-related reason. There is no plan for effective hybrid instruction but university expects compliance with whatever they come up with at the last minute**

**Nadine Fishel:** I definitely can’t answer 30 students in a lab enrollment question right now. I would like to present a different idea about asking students about whether they are willing to TA on campus. It’s not discriminatory, it’s preferential. It’s like day shift vs. night shift. There are courses that are very large. There may be both synchronous and asynchronous learning objectives and it may be that some TAs hold a section on campus and that section has TAs on campus and there may be sections that are held exclusively online. There also could be issues with limiting the amount of people. The question alone may be a way for the dept to determine who to assign to what section based on the fact that there will be a variety of ways that instruction is delivered. Part of putting TAs in different types of sections is about understanding what students can do in terms of coming to campus vs. learning online. It’s not like we’re saying you can’t come to campus so we don’t want you, I don’t think that’s the role of the university at all. This is a new situation and it's a new time. In spring there was very little instruction in person. It was all remote learning. In fall, we’re looking at mostly remote learning. What university is working very hard to do is keep education going…

**UC-Union Labor Management Meeting on July 14th**

**Dr. Carrie Byington (Executive Vice President of UC Health):** There's a coronavirus surge that's occurring nationally. A larger surge than initially present. Surge is related to increase of movement of people and increased transmission from reopening. **Although spring was large, only 4-5% of people are immune or have antibodies. We still don’t know if they are able to be affected. Majority of the population or 95-96% are susceptible to coronavirus.** Please take care.

We are watching new metrics (have been following overall cases, hospitalizations, and deaths) like case positivity. There is more testing now than in spring, but those tests don’t count for increased case numbers. **We are at 7.7% case positivity rate. The World Health Organization makes a recommendation to have case positivity below 5% for further reopening, while 10% positivity is the epidemic threshold. Some communities in southern california are above the pandemic threshold. State 7.7%. In the UC System we are at about 5% threshold,** mainly because Northern CA has less positivity than southern. We are better prepared today than in March and April. We are not overrun by the current cases

**We are at 77% occupancy in the hospitals and cognisant of each area. For ventilators, about 65% of the \~700 ventilators are available and only about 50 are used for Covid Patients.** We monitor PPE every 12 hours. We would like to see these numbers go down, but don't think we are at the peak yet.

We are concerned for fall and winter, because we will have influenza for those months. Careful with getting those COVID and influenza case numbers down. UC has been one of more prepared hospitals. We are sharing expertise with the rest of Southern California like we did with New York City and Navajo Nations in spring.

We still need a lot of dedicated action at the state level to slow down transmission. We are trying to understand Newsom recommendations. We are supportive of stricter guidance from the state.

**Ken Smith (Executive Director of Environmental Health and Safety at UCOP):** Our intention to do a hybrid model at most campuses. Onsite Summer Instruction has already been curtailed or canceled. “Agile” is the word for what we are doing.

All locations are watching the curve and measure and engage. Berkeley and Merced starts earlier due to their semester systems. **Both those campuses have stated that August 1st is their internal deadline for creating procedures for fall. It is September 1st for the remaining campuses to have their plans.** Each will be responsive to in place measures. We are looking for a lab to be done in person as well as medicine. We are trying to find out which makes sense and which can be done remotely

We are ramping up research with an effort to resume non-essential research. **Campuses are actively evaluating whether to dial down or continue.** There are regional differences between the campuses. Chancellors are looking for options, and there's not a system wide policy. Individual plans at each location. We nade guidelines on symptom screenings with a number of changes per local campus.

**Questions From Different Unions**

**Question:** What are the different reopening categories?

**Ken Smith:** Every campus has quite a bit of information dedicated toward instruction. With respect to research, there is still a lid of the number of employees coming to campus to research. This varies by location, with some caping the location by number and some by percentage \[EDITOR'S NOTE: UCSB is using Percentage\]. I think of each laboratory like an independent franchise in a mall. We are having each lab make their own COVID plans according to the PI and then send it to the chancellor.

My recommendation, go to your campus reopening procedures, look at the research protocols, and ask questions off of there. There are two websites for the situation: external-facing UC system [https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/coronavirus](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/coronavirus) and the internal facing one [https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/coronavirus](https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/coronavirus). The office of research certainly has plans.

**Question:** Can you comment on contact tracing?

**TL;DR: They are working on a program**

**Dr. Carrie Byington:** We issued a set of recommendations June 4th and updated recently on Thursday. Two different words to be aware of: case investigations, which the campus is responsible for, and contract tracing, which is a public health duty that must delegate authority if the campus is going to do it. UCSD and UCI are pursuing delegated authority while others are doing case investigation and liaison. As a system, we are working to train contract tracers and case investigators through a program that trains 10,000 contract tracers. We have recommended a minimum 15 tracers per 100,000 people on campus. That's the state recommendations, although higher numbers are better. It would include the expected population, and population density of everyone. We made a recommendation from UC Health that we should be reducing density from pre-covid times.

**Ken Smith:** We are working and in close contact with no information that's given to them. Case investigation is handled through occupational health, which is new on the main campus side. General information is given if there is a case in a certain group. Privacy of individuals is respected.

If we were informed that the person is positive. Case investigators will determine everything. Inform individuals if needed and they were in close contact. **We believe that transient exposure may not lead to notifications.**

**Follow-Up Question:** At UCSF, Nobody sharing a lab with someone who got coronavirus was notified, but people in their breakroom were. In the lab they were just a few feet away and never given a specific notice nor a general notice.

**Ken Smith:** No idea why it wasn’t sent. It makes sense that a notification should have been sent. Those individuals may have not had contact.

**Peter Chester (Director of UCOP Labor Relations):** We received many anecdotes on this and sent them onto senior management. This is not a place to review anecdotes.

**Question:** Can you comment on Cleaning Standards?

**Ken Smith:** Protocols with respect to cleaning are in the reopening plan. Some campuses are doing a tiered approach. Lower levels are less-in depth but frequent. Some areas are just being locked down and left to decay naturally. We will have more in-depth protocols for confirmed cases. We are working on training the workforces for cleaning at UC Campuses. We are trying to create a website but that is really challenging.

**Question: Why are workers being asked to return to campus during a peak when coronavirus is increasing faster than the spring?**

**Dr. Carrie Byington: I can’t answer that here. I work at UCOP level and we emphasize that everyone should stay at home whenever possible.**

**Peter Chester:** The possible return to work is pushed back.

**Ken Smith:** We will see some variance with some jobs being pushed back.

**Follow-Up Question: People are being forced back into buildings, despite their job easily being done remotely, like IT Administrators. This is reality. Your departments are not following your own guidelines.**

**Dr. Carrie Byington: I meet with UC CEOs regularly. I will ask about this.**

**Question:** Will you provide priority office space for parents. Researchers are wishing to access office space on campus, as they can’t research as effectively at home.

**Ken Smith:** Many of our employees may not have ideal home employees. We are working on a “Select and Elect“ program. Once time comes along, we would like to identify these employees and allow them to work on-site. I think this is happening at UC Berkeley. We haven’t received permission to go through with this yet.

**Question:** Can you comment on COVID testing policy and standards?

**Dr. Carrie Byington:** Testing is undergoing a lot of changes. We are experiencing a shortage of testing agents. CDC changed their guidance last week. We are reevaluating guidance to test contacts of covid positive.

**Question:** What is appropriate test turnaround time? Currently it is a week.

**Dr. Carrie Byington:** There is a 24 Hour turnaround time goal. Meeting the time most of the time. We are looking at additional platforms. PCR test takes 24 hours. We are looking at new tests using Antigen that are like a rapid strep throat test. We want to get hold of that. Trying to diversify our testing agents so we are not dependent on one source.

**Question:** Can you comment on on campus housing?

**Dr. Carrie Byington**: I can comment on dormitories, as part of our testing &amp; tracing task force. Our efforts are focused on lowering density, recommending 1 person per dorm room. **If there are two persons per room, we will have to have plexiglass dividers.** We are assessing if campuses can do this safely. If a student tests positive or contacted someone positive, we have to have sufficient room to quarantine. We are evaluating the number of rooms available at each campus.

**Question:** What is the UC's Role in education about masking, social distancing, etc?

**Ken Smith:** We are taking an active role in educating campuses and working on their own education orientations and platforms. We are educating why distance is important. This is part of the return for all employees as well. Some orientation and instruction will be part of the returning process. We are taking an active role in social media and push out all the public health guidance."

idk. these past few weeks ive just been getting super anxious over everything, especially requirements and all that. i always get that feeling that maybe i was missing something or a crucial deadline has gone by that would affect my enrollment. i try to double check everything and check my emails daily but im still uneasy. my parents haven’t ever really helped me with registration from middle school to high school and then now. im also out of state which adds the prospect of moving into unfamiliar territory. so there goes a little more buildup to my anxiety. bottomline is i really just don’t want to mess this up but i have this lingering feeling that im going to. i just want to go and get settled on campus already but there’s this thought that what if i missed something and im not allowed to stay and study. it’s all a bit irrational, unfortunately.

ikgcfu,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/ikgcfu/ucsd_declassified_textbook_survival_guide_aka_a/,UCSD Declassified Textbook Survival Guide [aka a guide to finding your textbook online and what to do if you can't],19,48,2020-09-01 01:08:07,"Textbooks are a scam, and this isn't news to anyone. Here's the short and sweet guide to lowering your out of pocket cost (looking at you rosy-eyed freshman and transfers):

**Section 1: Trying to find your textbook online**


1. Join the UCSD Textbook Exchange facebook group if you haven't already. They have a huge google sheet of textbooks collected over the years. Search that list and if you don't see a copy of your textbook there, move on to step 2.


2. Search the textbook exchange group on facebook directly for past posts mentioning the book you're looking for, and see if anyone linked a copy on one of those posts. If you find a someone that did, but the link is dead, message them or the person that posted asking for it. Chances are they still have a copy and can send it to you. I don't know any student that wouldn't do this for a fellow triton.

3. If you still can't find a copy, check Library Genesis (aka Libgen). This website is God's gift to us students, and has almost every PDF imaginable. If it ain't on here, then oh boy you're gonna have to dig deep to find a copy.

4. Check b-ok/Z-Library to see if you can find a copy on there

5. Last resort, go here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/megathread/reading_material_and_elearning   and try some of the custom search engines and other sites

6. If you still can't find a copy, and then try to make a post on the textbook exchange group and ask for a copy of the book. If no one posts in a few days, then chances are that a copy of the textbook isn't online, or at least in any easily accessible area


**Section 2: What to do if you cant find a copy of your textbook**

So your professor is an asshole and is forcing you to buy the reader/textbook they wrote and its mAnDaToRY for the class. Or maybe the textbook is as rare as an unstressful day at UCSD. Whatever the case here is what you can do to try and save some money

1. Find out if your prof is keeping reserve copies at Geisel. If they are, you're good, just use that when you need to, take pics of the pages you need, and be off on your merry way.

2. If it's a reader, then get a group of friends/accomplices in the class and pool money together to get a single copy. Tear off the spine (or if its looseleaf even better) carefully and go to a Kinkos (I think they're called Fedex Office now? idk i feel old) or some other place with access to a feed scanner and just rapid scan those pages onto a flashdrive and give your friends/people in the class a copy. You're now a hero to everyone in the class!

3. If it's a textbook that you can't find online, ask your BOTH your professor AND your TA if you can buy a previous edition of the textbook, and if they say yes, buy it off of a website like abebooks or similar. Previous textbook editions go for wayyyy cheaper than the current edition, and will save you a bunch of money. OR see if you can rent the current or previous edition from a textbook rental service (Chegg has this i think). Renting can be way cheaper and will give you access as long as you need the book. Take screenshots as you go and assemble a PDF at the end of the quarter and post that shit to save future generations some trouble and money.

4. If you cannot do any of the above, and a new book is your ONLY option, which is NEVER the case, then go splitskies with some friends and call it a day.

NOTES: 

-  Check out UCSD SPACES Booklending program. I don't know much about it, but it seems like another way to get free or significantly discounted textbooks from UCSD directly.

- Check UCSD Free &amp; For Sale to see if anyone is selling a copy of the book you're looking for for cheap 


Congrats, you've saved hundreds, if not a few thousands of that sweet FAFSA money, buy something nice, save or donate to charity, whatever you want!"

That's cheating. It's literally like taking an essay you wrote for one class, and turning it in for another class.

I get that it's less work for the professor and much of the info they're covering is the same this quarter, but not having a live lecture makes this whole virtual learning thing even less real than it already has become.

I think most people would agree that class is more ""real"" when it's in person. A professor stands in the front of the hall, students are seated, and you raise your physical hand in order to ask questions. We have like one fifth of that ""realness"" in virtual classes. And when professors pull shit like recycling old podcasted lectures, now you have 1/25th of any semblance of a real class.

Zoom classes are weirdly dehumanizing... everyone else in your class feels more like a Redditor or a Youtube commenter, not really a human.

This is wishful thinking, but I think we've learned a lot about the virus since we first got that dreaded email in March. Maybe they could find a way for UCSD to reopen safely... Like maybe for a MW class, half the class could be expected to show up on Monday and the other half on Wednesday. For the day you're not supposed to come, you'd have the Zoom lecture set up for you.

But all it takes is for someone to wake up with a slight sore throat, and you can't expect someone like that to show up, regardless of whether they've been tested yet.

I think the other big thing, and this should apply to everyone, is that when this period is finally over, then you'll never take another ""normal"" day for granted. You'll know that any day's a good day if you can get coffee with your friends, go on a date, etc.

I’m so sad and can’t stop thinking of him, can’t stop sobbing and crying. Life is too fragile and unexpected. 

Mental health is so important especially for those students who are experiencing any physiological issues, no matter is stress over family issues, romantic relationships, school works or anything. Please do not hesitate seeking professional helps. However, the isolation during pandemic is not helping at all. Life needs to go back to normal as soon as possible, and I really wanna meet new friends in person who can bring me more positive energies  once it’s safe to meet. 

UCSD Week 7 oh lord... Wish this quarter can go faster and faster. Wish this year can end soon with no more sadness.

Edit: Thank you all for your kind words. Grieving is hard but I understand it’s going to be a process, and we always have great support around us. Life needs go on. Life must go on. Anxiety and depression is my biggest enemy, and I believe many of UCSD students are experiencing the same. I’m not alone, and we are not alone. I believe we can go through this together during this hard time. 🙏"
jvcjr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/jvcjr6/my_recovery_from_covid/,My recovery from COVID,135,41,2020-11-16 10:53:27,"I haven't got officially tested as it was really recent but I will soon. I am pretty sure it's not the flu because I've gotten a flew shot a few months ago. The days before my fever broke, I just felt really unmotivated and did not have the energy to work on school stuff. I didn't know I was sick. I started stressing more about school, and even thought I'd give up on a PA. I had an essay due right when I got sick. I just turned in my first draft which needed a lot of work but there was no way that I was going to do anything that took the smallest amount of energy. This was all last week, very minor, unnoticeable symptoms that I wrote off as me being lazy and tired.

On Saturday morning, when I had planned to do all the work to catch up, my fever broke. I was hot and cold at the same time, delirious, thinking about things that completely made no sense. My head hurt. I was shivering and shaking, while sweating at the same time. I put on my blanket half way, had my space heater on, and any position with the combination of blanket on/off, space heater on off, was extremely uncomfortable. I got the chills, said nonsense, I'm pretty sure, and was so fatigued, I couldn't even imagine getting on my computer to get some work done. I was in my bed shivering and sweating from around 9:00AM when I woke up to around 4:00PM. I was in and out of consciousness  I had no appetite even after not eating for days. When I order food (too sick to go out and I live alone), it didn't taste like anything. What I felt that I tasted was what my mind thinks it's supposed to taste like, it was the weirdest thing. I barely ate two slices of pizza and just kept drinking water. I felt so screwed for school. I just went to sleep again.

On Sunday, the fever was gone and I felt better. Again I ordered food that's at least a little more nutritional than pizza. I kept drinking fluids and took my multi vitamins. I had enough energy to sit in front of the computer and watch Youtube videos but not enough energy to do anything productive. It was difficult to write things in logical order or trying to explain something like my experience. I slept again early.

It's Monday, and I woke up refreshed. I took a look at my PA that I felt I had no chance of finishing and finished that part in about 30 minutes. My cognitive functions seem to return to me, and my energy is good. I can tell I'm still not at 100%, but I'm getting there.

I know people say it's not a big deal and it's going to be okay, but I definitely lost a lot of points on my essay because I didn't have the energy nor motivation to edit it. I got lucky my fever broke on a weekend and didn't screw with any of my other classes. It sucks being in school while sick, let alone with no one to take care of you with all these dead lines. Imagine getting sick during midterms or finals! So I'd say, please be careful, but I was careful, followed all the rules, and even gave out my personal masks away to neighbors and friends far before this happened. So COVID doesn't care about how careful you are nor about your COVID karma. I guess be extra super careful so that it doesn't happen to you when finals are approaching! Stay safe, drink tons of fluids, take bunch of vitamins, and please stay as isolated as possible! If you are feeling tired and unmotivated all of a sudden, please give your body some rest instead of trying to fight it like I did because it's going to take longer for you to recover and maybe even give you worse symptoms. Please stay safe!"

&amp;#x200B;

The pandemic is a massive crisis that has affected the lives of practically every student. When UCSD originally allowed P/NP for Spring quarter 2020, this was done because of the sudden shift to online learning that both instructors and students needed to adapt to. Measures needed to be taken to reduce the stakes/stress for everyone involved, and universal P/NP was an effective method for achieving that.

I would argue that the mental wellness of the student body has never been worse. Sure, you can ""adapt"" to terrible conditions, but that doesn't change the fact that the conditions are terrible. And over time, that wears you down hard. If the university's original intention with P/NP in Spring 2020 was to reduce the mental stress/toll that the current situation is having on its undergrads, now is a more relevant time than ever to roll out a policy that meaningfully furthers that goal.

This would not jeopardize the ""value"" of a degree from UCSD. Many major universities that historically rank higher than UCSD have implemented very lenient P/NP policies out of concern for their undergrads.

Refusing to follow suit would not grant UCSD a reputation of being ""uniquely dedicated to preserving the integrity/value of its degree"". It will, however, give it a rightly deserved reputation of being uniquely cold/callous towards its students."

I'm sure you've all seen the countless posts about MATH 183, mostly from the one guy, but I would like to affirm that this class is a complete nightmare. I seriously want to rip my hair out because of the professor, and I don't think that they even care about it. 

Here are some fun things she's done 

* Had multiple quizzes (including the latest one) where there were **no correct answers for questions**, probably because she just takes all of her questions from a test bank
* Hasn't actually taught us MATH 183. We're not only insanely behind, but the content we're covering is equivalent to MATH 11. She's TA'ing MATH 1005 at the university of sydney (which is a freshman level course) and just using the slides. A lot of the time during lecture she seems like she's reading the slides for the first time, and sometimes she just skips slides?????
* Recorded the last lecture AT A PARTY and you could hear the EDM throughout the lecture...
* Gave us a project that made little to no sense and then disappeared. When we finally got in contact with her and asked to clarify sections of the project, she was just as confused as we were. The data sets we were given were also complete garbage and completely biased, which was terrible to work with. As well as that, when we were dealing with data cleaning, she just told us to remove outliers completely? Which you aren't supposed to do? You can't just remove valid data points???????
* For the latest project we just submitted, she sent a canvas message saying that she was making no concessions, and that she was going to be extremely strict about it, probably because everyone gave negative reviews on her midquarter survey. If you mess up the header of your project, or submit in the wrong format, you lose 25% of the project grade for each offense...

The lectures are also borderline unwatchable because she's trying to understand them at the same time, so she spends a lot of time fixing mistakes and going on tangents that make no sense. 

I really want to get help or email the math department, but I'm afraid they aren't going to do anything about it. This class is important for my future classes, so I'm really stressing out about it.

I’m not on the soccer team, but realistically, senior year isn’t postponed. It’s cancelled. If you’re not already on campus for a lab or something like that, you’re probably not coming back in Winter or Spring.

Classes are going to stay virtual.

When we got the email in March, I (and many others) thought this would all be over by summer, or Fall at the latest. It turns out that’s not how vaccines work.

This obviously isn’t as bad as losing someone, but I’d like to give this analogy. I’ve lost a few relatives and it can happen a couple different ways. On one hand, you can lose someone slowly and expectedly. Maybe they have a lung problem, they spend some time in the hospital, they come back home, and everyone gets to fly in and say goodbye. On the other hand, you can get the unexpected news that someone who seemed perfectly healthy didn’t wake up this morning. This surprise death hurts so much more IN MY OPINION. You didn’t have the chance to say goodbye. You didn’t have the chance to prepare for it. I loved being an undergrad on campus, but I never had the chance to say “this is my last quarter here.” It just came by surprise.

I understand that some people have it worse, but the way this has all played out, I am still really really unsettled. As a senior, I don’t think I’ll take a “real” undergraduate class ever again."

I work at the La Jolla Trader Joe’s and last night we found out an employee tested positive **after** showing symptoms. A lot of other employees (like...half the people scheduled for today) are staying home either for their own safety or to self quarantine, so the store is super short staffed now. Management isn’t giving any info to customers on WHY they’re short staffed though, which feels unethical to me, hence why I’m posting here.

The infected person and anyone they had close, unmasked contact with is quarantining, so the risk of shopping there should be low. However, i believe customers should have the full picture before making a decision about whether to shop somewhere.""

I was in Geisel on the 6th floor working on my FINAL MMW essay at night when I got bombarded with messages from friends about the school’s decision to effectively close campus. I didn’t believe it at first until I got the actual email minutes later. There were two girls sitting in front of me who were exchange students from Norway and I still remember the look of shock on their faces. I texted my mom and forwarded her the school email, and by the end of the week I had moved out of my campus apartment. Totally insane to think that was 8 moths ago 😢

I am now convinced it’s because too many students would overwork the TAs.

This is a genuine question. In a physical classroom, I understand why class size is limited because there might not be enough seats in the room.

In a class that has a research paper (or multiple), I also understand because that might be too much work for the professor who has to grade them.

But in a Zoom class, for which your entire grade depends exclusively on a multiple choice midterm/final, I can't imagine why class sizes are so limited.

I could hypothesize this is a conspiracy to keep students in school longer and make more money off of them, but there might be other logistical reasons that I don't understand."

First, someone could easily just scan their box, then remove their box from the machine, and then swipe their ID card. This is a huge vulnerability way to cheat the system. And the dining halls staff really should be monitoring the situation, but yet they don't even seem to be paying attention.

What would've been a more logical sense solution is to link the reusable container barcode to the dining hall account. So as soon as you put the box into the machine, it automatically refunds your money back to your account. And since the barcode id was linked to your account, there's no possible fraud or cheating that could be happen.

Not to mention, having to swipe your card each time is a point of contact potentially a problem to spread Covid from contaminated surfaces.

I'm looking for advice on how to proceed. 

So, I'm finding myself in a bit of a never-ending predicament with a false allegation of academic misconduct. It all started with my MATH 10B class during SP20. My professor reported a crazy amount of AI ""violations"". The stress really got to me over the summer, and it ruined several opportunities for me. 

Since the middle of my first year, I've been working towards a major change to Molecular and Cell Biology. For those that don't know, the last quarter you're ""allowed"" to petition for enrollment into Biology Department capped majors is your sixth quarter. For me, that was SP20. I've heard that no one has trouble so long as they meet the requirements. MATH 10B was my last required course to petition for my  major change, and my grade got withheld due to my professor's allegation. It was just 3 weeks ago that he rescinded his allegation, and I got my grade a few days after that. It didn't do me much good, as the Biology Department had already denied my petition because of my missing grade. 

I explained my situation to the department over VAC, and they pretty much told me I'd have to re-apply during my 7th quarter and be marked ""ineligible"", though there is a small chance they'll still take me. I really don't know what to do here. It's my third year, and I'm struggling to find enough classes that would count towards Molecular and Cell Bio while also counting towards my fallback major, Environmental Systems. 

Does anyone have advice for me? Can I reach out to any higher level administration? Should I focus my efforts on Environmental Systems and stop pursuing Molecular and Cell Bio? Should I hold out for this one last quarter and see what happens? Any input is appreciated."

Sucking it up and taking the C- are all proper and acceptable ways to deal with it. Whining about ""COVID-related difficulties"", on the other hand, is not.

As the system's most prestigious and respected campus, we feel that it is important to honor and maintain an appropriate level of respect for our university's name. We feel that P/NP cheapens our brand and doesn't emphasize the incredible prestige associated with San Diego.

While it may be acceptable to have all other UC campuses offer P/NP due to their lack of recognition and prestige, this is not acceptable for the flagship and most well-known campus, and we therefore request that you cease requesting P/NP options this quarter. Thank you.

TL:DR

Don't keep asking for P/NP."
kffz09,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/kffz09/what_would_you_think_of_a_building_on_campus/,What would you think of a building on campus where students go to take short naps?,39,45,2020-12-17 22:38:13,"I know this sounds absurd, but hear me out.

If you have a dorm, you probably wouldn’t need to use this. You also probably wouldn’t need it if you get all your sleep at night.

But I know some people - both insanely busy students and NCAA athletes, who rely on a nap during the day in order to get REM sleep. Medical students especially do this a lot.

Many people take naps in their apartment, but I’ve also seen some people napping in their car, because maybe they live too far away. This “sleep library” would give you a place on campus to take a nap.

NBA players have road games that end at 10PM in different time zones, flights early the next morning, and practice everyday they’re not playing. So they don’t have time for 7-8 hours of uninterrupted sleep at night. It’s very common for NBA players to develop the routine of taking a nap during the day.

You’re probably not an NBA player, but there’s a good chance you’re just as busy as one, and so you might use this service if it existed. Once again, if you lived in a dorm, you’d have a dorm to sleep in at any time of day, but most people who aren’t freshmen do not have that option.

This “sleep library” would be a place that you could check into when you get sleepy, it would be dark, the AC would be running, and you’d give them your ID. They’d give you a bedsheet, pillow, and blanket. You’d quietly make your bed and take a nap for an hour. At the end of that hour, someone would come and wake you up, so you’d throw your sheets in a big laundry basket, take your stuff, and carry on with the day.

Maybe they could even go by a “credit” system. Everyone gets a free 3 hours of sleep library credit, and after you use that up, you have to pay for more credits. That would keep this place from always filling up with the same people.

I would’ve said they could keep it open all night too, in case your roommates are getting loud, but then too many people would use it on the regular.

Maybe they could even have multiple places on campus for something like this.

The only issue might be noise. Some people snore really loudly, which is ok, but I can see that being a problem in a room that people are trying to sleep in. I don’t think anyone wants to wear noise cancelling headphones to sleep, and I don’t know if any other kind of noise-cancelling technology exists to cancel out noise in the same room.

And of course, certain behaviors in the sleep library would get you banned."

I was in a verbally abusive relationship that ended poorly,I had a death in the family, and that tore what was left of my family apart. Even through all of that was still able to pass my courses, I found my very first best friend. I made connections with people that got me through that really low place and move forward. The end of that winter quarter the pandemic had started, and I wasn’t very negative about it at first. Then I started to realize when I am alone, like really alone, my mind eats at itself. I would venture outside to seek help again, but feel myself being dragged back into my chair to stare at a screen that tells me I’m either passing or failing, not in classes, at life. I wasn’t living, just existing.This quarter reminds me so much of my first quarter at college. Alone. Though I know now I am not alone. I choose to be alone. I choose to put in effort or not, I have mental blocks now and then, but I know I am capable of more if I try. I know everyone is capable of so much more when they are surrounded by those they love and trust, by those they choose to be around and help them get through the social construct of college and higher education. I don’t know what really the point of this post is, but mainly I just wanted to let y’all know that I see your posts, I read them. I am trying to convince myself I am more than just my grades this quarter, that this world won’t judge me for not doing more, not doing or being better at certain things. One of my professors this quarter will probably always be my favorite because I know she has been through what is imposter syndrome, something I thought I would never have or experience. So, I guess what I’m trying to say is that I am trying and I want you guys to try too, it doesn’t have to get better, you just have to keep going, because good things come to those who seek them, ask for help, tell your parents you love them but you know you aren’t feeling loved. Today is December 4th, there will be worse days to come and much better days as well. I know you all are capable of finding motivation to look forward to both of those scenarios and come out the other side with a better understanding of who you are and where you have come from. Anyways, I think I’m trying, trying to see the better scenario. Love y’all - A"
k71r9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/k71r9u/the_uc_socially_dead_stereotype_definitely_has/,"The ""UC Socially Dead"" stereotype definitely has truth to it but I think that worked out really well for me.",28,12,2020-12-04 21:20:27,"I am saying this as a senior. UCSD is a lot of things, but a party school it is not. The school is still social enough that I got the best of both worlds.

Anyone who thinks UCSD is actually socially dead probably didn't spend enough time on campus. Most of us have friends, and other than this year's freshmen, most of us went to at least a handful of parties last year. These parties probably weren't as wild as the ones at SDSU can get, and they probably didn't happen as frequently, but they existed.

I have never been *that* social, but I've always been social enough that I'd be doing at least something fun with my friends every weekend, save midterms and finals week. We might've gone to a party, we might've hiked Rose Canyon, we might've just sat around and talked, etc. Those were good times.

In freshman year, this girl on my floor really wanted to study on a Friday night, but we made her come to a party with us. She made $100 at that party on a bet that she could do a backflip. I kind of want to say her name because she's come so far, but I won't.

If I'd been at a ""party school,"" I feel like one of two things would have happened. I would have either felt really lonely for not wanting to party as much as others OR I would have started to party so much it would have been unhealthy.

So in retrospect, I feel like I got the best of both worlds here at UCSD."

What I don’t get is how so many people don’t do CAPEs in classes that offer you extra credit for doing them. Do you not want the extra credit?

There can’t possibly be so many people sitting on such a comfortable A in the class that extra credit won’t help them.

You don’t have to write such thorough reviews.

“Provide specific examples of how the professor did/did not make this a welcoming classroom environment.”

You can just say “he encouraged everyone to ask questions and made extra time for office hours.” That’s it. No need to write 10 paragraphs.

The whole review literally takes 3 minutes at most. If you’re literally taking 5 classes - the longest this can take you is 15 minutes.

Maybe it’s the “my vote won’t make a difference mindset.”

The professor often does it like “everyone gets an extra credit point if at least 70% of you do the CAPE review.” So maybe people think their individual CAPE won’t make much of a difference in reaching that 70%, and that they’ll get the extra credit anyway.

It would be interesting to know if more people do CAPEs when the professor gives extra credit based on the whole class’s participation OR if more people do CAPEs if turning in a screenshot gets you extra credit."

I hope you're all doing well and holding up through Week 9. I just wanted to let you know that all of us at AS hear your voice and are doing everything we can to make sure that UCSD administration acts according to the interests of the students. Unfortunately, it seems that both the initiative of individual students and the input of the AS Office of Academic Affairs have thus far failed to convince UCSD faculty that they must make adjustments to academic policies for this quarter. In fact, they seem to be working directly against the interests of the students by scheduling a selection of important courses as in-person only for next quarter, despite the large number of our students who are currently taking their classes remotely from all corners of the US and all over the world. 
My message to all Tritons is that this fight is not over. Keep signing petitions and contacting the relevant people to make sure your voice is heard. Myself and others from AS and the college councils will be working through the weekend and stepping up our efforts to push UCSD faculty to make necessary changes to these academic policies. I'll provide an update early next week with as many relevant details as possible.

People from so many different places go to this school. I’ve met people from all kinds of religions, countries, states, etc. And we’re accustomed to seeing diversity.

I think that says something about San Diego too. La Jolla/University City are mostly white upper-middle class communities, and San Diego has leaned Republican until recently, but this is not a white farm town in Alabama. A white guy with a Persian girlfriend wouldn’t be puzzling for anyone to see in San Diego. In other areas, that would be really confusing.

There are other parts of the country which are not so diverse. I’m not saying people in those areas are necessarily hateful, but diversity can be very surprising and foreign. I wouldn’t want to move into an area like that.

I’ve been on road trips to areas where people get stared at for looking different. Again, that doesn’t mean they hate you, but they’ll think you’re foreign because they’re not used to seeing people who look like you.

Everyone in San Diego is accustomed to seeing diversity. I don’t think anyone would be surprised to see a hijab, a yarmulke, or someone on the phone speaking a different language. Diversity is not an abstract concept for anyone who lives in San Diego.

As a senior, I am looking for jobs in other areas. San Diego is not the only place in the world that’s diverse, but there are areas that are not.

Do you have any advice? Maybe I’m overthinking all this lol"

I was wondering how hard it is to get an A, especially because the Final Paper is worth 30% of your grade. My TA is Eric Rodriguez, and I think he's phenomenal! For anybody thats had him as their TA, on average, how difficult has his grading been on the Final Papers? For anybody who's taken the course in general, how hard have your TA's graded you compared to your first reading journals? Note that this quarter (due to it being online), the only actual graded things that we've had are the first reading journal and the Final Paper. The other things are graded for completion and effort.

UCSD was the hardest thing I've ever done and made me doubt if I was ever a good student. The stress, the exams every three weeks, the hyper competitive bullshit, the ""weeder classes""  designed to weed you out from certain paths. As a graduate student currently, I know the challenges of being a student in a pandemic. I know teaching yourself from a video lecture is extremely difficult. Not to mention, everyone having to be isolated. 

But you are so much stronger than you think. The grades you get during your undergraduate career don't define who you really are. It doesn't define your work ethic or how smart you are. Whoever taught you that your worth was based on a score or a letter was wrong. If you need to just survive the next four, five years, you do it. If you need to just survive day by day, do it. Your grades don't reflect how smart, innovative, ambitious and awesome you are. I know GPA is an important requirement for grad school and med school. But one thing I've learned is that it's not your time at UCSD that will define the rest of your life path. It's not about the Ws you needed to take to survive. It's about how you course corrected and came back from it. I don't know who needs to hear this but you deserve to be kind to yourself. You're going through school at an extremely difficult university during one of the most challenging times in recent history. You deserve to forgive yourself for failed exams or quizzes or the Ws you needed to take to mentally just get through. You can come back from any failures or mistakes. Be kind to yourself. You deserve to take care of yourself physically and mentally too. Please seek out help sooner rather than later. You are so much more than a transcript or numbers on a page. And I'm so proud of you. Have a safe and happy holiday."

Here are my reasons why I think UCSD might be taking in too many students:

Number one, it's already so difficult to get major classes and adding new students makes it even more difficult. I'm a senior, and even I have needed to get in off the waitlist for some required classes. Many underclassmen with later appointment times just can't make it in.

Number two, more spots means less competition, making it easier to get in. This is apparent in some of the new freshmen I met last year (19-20). I had to take some of my final GEs where I met some freshmen, and it felt to me like the new freshman class had included less studious/competitive students.

I AM NOT SAYING LESS COMPETITIVE STUDENTS ARE DUMBER THAN MORE COMPETITIVE STUDENTS ARE. In fact, I'm sure many students who didn't even get into UCSD are much smarter than I am, and will be much more successful than I will be after we graduate. The thing is, what makes you competitive on paper, often translates into what kind of a student you will be in a college classroom. And if you're in a class with a bunch of cut-throat competitive students, you're going to have a different experience compared to if you'd been in a class in which no one studies more than half an hour a day.

UC Riverside is a school with very intelligent people. And it's a great school. I'm sure a lot of research that's done there is beyond what my brain could comprehend. That said, the overall student body at UCR is different from the overall student body at UCSD. I've visited some friends there, and it's a lot more laid back. Let me put it this way. UCR is not a ""socially dead"" school at all.

The question ultimately is this. Does UCSD want its overall student body to stay very competitive and studious? If it does, then I think it is admitting too many students.

But if UCSD wants to turn more into a school like UCR, (which would be totally understandable), then it's going in the right direction.

Not to mention, more students means more tuition money. More students also means more food being bought on campus, books bought at the bookstore, even more scantrons purchased from the downstairs Goody's market.

EDIT: I’m seeing a lot of comments about how this has to do with pressure from UC and not really a decision UCSD made itself. That might be true, but the fact that it’s a problem still holds."

If you just asked, I would’ve let you. You stood to the side, to where I couldn’t tell if you were directly shooting me, until my boyfriend went down to help the photographer. I was standing on the ledge facing library walk. You walked up behind me and started taking my photo. 

I was extremely uncomfortable with someone behind me, that I didn’t know while I was standing on the ledge above the Geisel entrance. I knew what you were doing. But I couldn’t say anything, I was too afraid. I was too afraid of falling, I was freezing out there. 

I was repeatedly sexually assaulted by my physical therapist when I was 16. I am 23 now. Today was the first day that I publicly displayed the emotions artistically. I only had told my parents about it a month ago. This wasn’t easy for me. 

When my boyfriend confronted you telling you how fucked up it is for you to use me when I’m creating an artistic piece about how I was abused, you said you wouldn’t delete them. I don’t know nor care about the legality of it. I just wish I was able to go home feeling better about myself. But instead I felt like my story was never going to end. That people don’t care about who I am.

Taking photos of me during a vulnerable, emotional shoot for my own personal growth without my permission is wrong. I’m sorry you cannot understand that or respect my story. 

TLDR: I was repeatedly abused as a teen and decided to do a photo shoot telling my story today. Man came up behind me while I was standing on the Geisel ledge above the entrance facing away from him and took photos of me. He wouldn’t delete them.

Side note that's about to become relevant: I'm a guy, and I had just gotten out of the shower. 

So i join. I look around, there's no one obviously bc it's hours and hours after the lecture actually happened. Then I see the little record button lit up at the top left. I go ""oh fuck"". I leave the meeting. All is well.

Then, not even an hour later, I get the canvas email. ""Zoom Recording of Cogs xxx ON Jan. 5""

""Sweet"" I say. It has to be the lecture right?? 

Wrong.

It's a 16 second clip of shirtless me with depressing ass indie music in the background going ""oh no.... fuckkkkkkkkkkkkk"" under my breath. 

I email the prof ASAP. He doesn't know how it got there or how to take it down. I admit defeat, then try helping him figure out how Zoom works.

I'm currently taking 18 units with 4 classes total. I'm doing pretty well with BILD 1, okay with mmw 12 and must 17, but absolutely horrible with chemistry 6a. I'm thinking of dropping the class. I'm struggling a lot with my state of mind right now and I'm really considering that maybe uni isn't for me. I'm a general biology major and although I find my BILD class to be interesting I'm very surprised at myself to find out how much I hate math and chem I mean I despise it holy wow I never want to do it again in my life. And if I'm going to be totally honest I'm scared. I have low self esteem issues, and my anxiety has been so bad regarding school that I struggle falling asleep at night because I feel so nauseous. No matter what I do my anxious thoughts won't go away and their so loud. The only thing that distracts me is reading my comics. I find comfort in them. Because of that since the beginning of the quarter I've slowly had less and less work effort. With BILD i have a good grade and I'm caught up with most lectures. Mus and mmw I've only done the first weeks work but because of the assignments I'm not failing yet. I think if I try to catch up with the work, which is my plan for today and tomorrow, and keep schedule I might do well or at least leave the classes with a B I hope. For chemistry is where it all went wrong. I know it's a problem, I do it all the time. I'm scared I'll fail and I don't feel competent enough to learn the work. Because of this I haven't seen any lectures and only done a few assignments by pure luck and the class resources. I have a 66% and I want to drop it. I need the class for my major though and although I'm sure I could take it again, the thing is I don't know if I still want to do general biology. I don't have any passions or anything I particularly love. Going out of high school my only thoughts for a career was that I thought working with plants would be nice. Working in a garden or conservatory was the only thing I considered as something I would want to do. Due to financial aid this is the only school I could afford because I could commute and didn't need to pay for housing. The closest thing they had to me taking a horticulture path was general biology because it was broad. But these classes. I can't do them I'm not smart enough for them. I could barely get through my pre calc class. And online learning is so hard. I didn't think it would be this hard to do the work alone. Maybe it would have been easier going in person and l having to take notes right there or maybe things would have been the same I don't know. What I do know is that I really hate school. And I hate that I feel that way because so many people don't get this opportunity, because my parent didn't get this opportunity and as a first generation student I'm scared of how much of a disappointment I'll become if I tell my parents I don't want to go to school or if I tell them I'm at least considering community college and getting a job. I feel so many expectations, especially since I'm in a sense their best hope. My eldest brother dropped out of college, my second brother has a degree but it's not useful unless he gets a masters which his GPA is too low to qualify for a program so he's gonna join the military. And I. I'm supposed to be the golden Child. Good grades in high school got into a good university plans to study in the stem field. They want me to be a scientist. But I can't. I hate it so bad. It's so hard. And I know I'm a coward. I want to quit when I've barely started. But I so badly want to escape. I want to go to sleep a d just wake up somewhere else with a different t l ife. Or just not wake up at all. And I don't know what to do. Maybe it's possible to become a horticulturalist or have a well paying job in the field without a degree and just working my way up the ladder. But I'm sure it's better to have a degree or it's necessary. I feel awful and I would really just like to not feel this way anymore but Im lost. I want to at least talk to my mom but I know she'll be disappointed and I know how horrible it's gonna be if my dad finds out. I don't know if I should take a gap year. If that's even possible. I should probably see a therapist. I've been wanting to see one since sophomore year of high school but it's just never happened and when I was really trying to get my mom to get me one the pandemic hit. But I don't want to do online therapy I want to be in person but I don't know if my parents will let me right now considering stuffs still bad. And it's gonna be hard getting a session soon if I can. I need help that much is obvious. But it's so hard for me to reach out to my family. I guess from this overall vent I want to ask if I should dropped chem 6a, where can I talk to someone about gap years, or transferring to a  community college at least for GE's, I want to switch majors but there isn't anything to do with agriculture and all the other science ones I dislike or I need to do chem for so any suggestions lol I'm despite to not do math or chem ever again in my life, and does anyone know if it's possible to meet with a therapist on a same day kind of thing of thing because I would really like the stop feeling like I need to barf every second of the day and get some really sleep I mean my eyes are puffy from crying and it sucks"
kwsktp,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/kwsktp/emotionally_drained/,Emotionally Drained,6,16,2021-01-13 15:14:20,"I have never felt so unmotivated and drained to continue with school as I do right now. This is my third year here and only really do need 4 more quarters after this one, but this quarter is just not it.

Spring 2020 was my best quarter at UCSD with a 3.9 GPA (Was happy with that since the quarter before I was put on academic probation w a 1.7 GPA). In order to try and finish on time, or at least take fewer classes my fourth year, I did both summer sessions and decided to work during the summer, just to get my coins up to live in SD for the academic year. Luckily, I was able to do pass all three of my classes while still working a full-time job. Luckily I was able to land a mentor position over the summer and talk to students who were going to enter UCSD Fall '20, and as much as I loved talking to them, taking on other peoples situations and difficult times does get to someone (it at least got to me since I had no outlet to talk my problems with). 

I enter Fall '20 with some gas left in the tank and the motivation to keep going since I do want to enroll in an MBA right after undergrad. Still working as a mentor and having a second job, I managed to not catch COVID and still do good with my classes. (3.6 GPA). But then, finals week hit and I got the news that both my parents caught COVID (so I was not able to see them over break whatsoever) and someone dear to me was just taking from me.

So the break was not the best for me and it was actually quite lonely. I saw a lot of my friends post being with their families and it truly hurt me because I was not able to be there with my family and I only thought of the worst (they are good and healthy now). I just kept to myself the entire break and not able to interact with anybody. As someone who gets energy off of others, I was just not able to get anything throughout the break. And as much as I cared for my friend, it was for the better of me to just stop trying to even level out the friendship.

I have lost all motivation to continue Winter '21 and honestly, those around me are just taking energy from me that is no longer there. I am behind in MGT 131A and I have no one to reach out to for help. Currently back home and every time I talk about my goals at the dinner table, my dad says ""Boy you're trying to fly before you even run"" so now my tank is basically on empty and I feel no support around me...just giving the support I need. 

Now while I may be drained, if you can relate or just want to talk, let's talk. I may wanna quit, but I know I won't. And I won't let you quit either."

We're The UCSD Guardian, which, as you may know from reading the paper on campus or visiting [our website](https://www.ucsdguardian.org), is a student-run, self-funded, independent newspaper written and produced by your fellow Tritons. We've covered everything from [P/NP for Fall 2020](https://ucsdguardian.org/2021/01/03/p-np-for-fall-quarter-2020-explained/) to [UCSD basketball's first Division I games](https://ucsdguardian.org/2021/01/10/despite-early-lead-d-i-debut-snaps-24-game-win-streak-for-ucsd-mens-basketball/) to [student complaints about a particular math course](https://ucsdguardian.org/2020/12/14/student-complaints-regarding-upper-division-math-class/). But you might not know that The UCSD Guardian also featured the debut of the well-known webcomic [Poorly Drawn Lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poorly_Drawn_Lines#History) or that we sat down for [an interview with the ""Googly Eye Guy.""](https://ucsdguardian.org/2019/05/12/interview-googly-eye-guy/)

Recently, we noticed a [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/kr989r/i_feel_like_a_reddit_post_here_is_seen_by_more/) by u/Majeure21 that pointed out (correctly) that, especially now, we need to expand our reach and meet people where they are, and that includes r/UCSD. We're hoping to use this account, /u/TheUCSDGuardian, to share some of the articles that we think the UCSD community would most like to know about, including news, features, sports, and more. 

But journalism isn't a one-way street. If you have any questions or story ideas, let us know at editor@ucsdguardian.org (put ""Question"" or ""Story Idea"" in the subject line).

The rest of this post is a rant.

I have always hated how my parents' house has so many people. A three-bedroom house is not designed for eight people (including extended family) to live in. I am grateful to have a roof over my head, but this pisses me off. In a normal family, your aunt (who works and can support herself) would simply be expected to move out. I come from a culture in which no one would want that to happen. That's one of the many traditions I am very excited to stop following when I am independent.

I'm not sure if it's even legal.

My family is also very noisy, and everyone but me seems to have inherited an ""I cannot be distracted by noise"" gene. One person can be yelling over the phone, in the same room as someone who is hyperfocused in studying for their Step 1 exam.

In non-pandemic years, I have solved this problem by simply going to the library or coffee shop. Even my roommates on campus got kind of noisy, and it was no issue at all. I simply went around campus and tried to find quiet study areas and there were so many. I don't think I've ever had a class in Galbraith, but I'd be in those study rooms on the first floor all the time.

Even the ""basement"" of the Mandeville Center had so much space that was perfect for this. There were entire classrooms that no one would be in.... I'm not sure if you were allowed to go in those, but no one ever caught me. Oops.

This is the first time in my life I have needed to study in the same room as such loud people, and I have had nowhere else to go. Do you have any advice?"

Let’s be real, this year has been shit. We were forced into learning circumstances that are less than ideal. But I think we’ve taken things with grace and adapted well.

Professors are even more difficult, or incredibly lax. But we still keep going. While I love the online format, most of my fellow students aren’t doing as well, yet still have the grit to continue one. You are all doing spectacular.

lbhq7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/lbhq7z/harassment_from_administration_or_staff_in_general/,Harassment from Administration (or staff in general),245,11,2021-02-02 22:46:54,"I recently had an experience of being harassed both in person and over email by an administrator, and while I'm not going to write who it was or what exactly happened, I want to share what I did to address it so that other students know what to do (this is still in the process of being dealt with, so take this with a grain of salt because I don't know yet what the ultimate outcome will be).

First thing I did was I contacted my RA. I discussed what had happened, and this gave me important information about what to do and I found out that this administrator had done things like this before (which became a compelling piece of information later in the process). Next I called the office where this admin worked and gave an account of what happened, called the university and reported it to the office analogous to the office she works in for a particular college. At each step, I made sure to leave my name, my phone number, and my student ID.

Next step was posting on social media. I gave a thorough description of what happened, and tagged the university, my college, and a few other departments. My college ended up seeing it and contacted me, which helped me to get in touch with the boss of the admin that harassed me and got me his personal email address. My college also texted screenshots of my instagram posts to that boss, which helped me get an appointment. When the admin started emailing me, I CC'ed her boss so he'd see it all too. This led to the boss asking me to have a meeting with him the very next day, along with the admin being told she is not allowed to contact me.

Finally, I'll be submitting an official complaint to the office for the prevention of harassment and discrimination. If I'm not satisfied with the results, I've already told the admin's boss that I'll report what all happened to the media, and asked him to keep me updated as far as possible as to what all is going on with the situation (the admin's being reported to HR by her boss).

Overall, my advice is this: use up every avenue you have for dealing with harassment from admin and staff. Call everyone you can. Give them all the information you can. Write down exactly what happened ASAP in detail. And most of all, don't give up and don't settle for less than what you deserve."
lccm1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/lccm1k/i_dont_care_about_salary_if_my_degree_helps_me/,"I don’t care about salary.

That would’ve been totally ok. An honest income is respectable. What infuriates me is that I might have to take a minimum wage job, four years later and with thousands of dollars in debt.

As a first generation college student, everyone in my family was excited I was going to UCSD. They had no idea how GEs worked, major classes, internships, etc. They thought that a degree was the golden ticket.

I’m not saying a degree is useless, but I think we all know that a degree on its own does not guarantee you a high paying job. Experience is also important. In my four years, I’ve had not a single internship.

I don’t expect a lot of money from my first job. What I am hoping for is that it’s a job that requires a college degree. Otherwise, I’ll have really mixed feelings about whether coming here was worth it for me.

If I end up getting a job as a cashier at sprouts, that’s honest respectable work, but I could have done that exact same job out of high school. So I will feel really unsettled about having spent four years and so much money going to UCSD.

On the other hand, if I end up somewhere that I needed to go to school for, even if I don’t make a lot of money, I’ll be reaping the results of these four years."

I have never been super extroverted, but I am the kind of person who feels energized after having spent time with other people.

I used to hate group projects, but God bless the professors who keep assigning them. They're such a pain in the ass, but the highlight of my week is sometimes spending an hour or two on a Zoom call with other group members.

I never want the Zoom calls to end. Even if all we do is talk about something as mundane as integer partitioning, I just want to see someone's face, say their name, and hear them say mine.


I love fantasy fiction, but even that's starting to get draining. I checked out *Dragons of Spring Dawning* from the library, because I loved the first two books in the *Dragonlance Chronicles*, but I am honestly too numb to sit down and read a book for so long.

This might be TMI, but as far as I can remember, this is the first time in my life that I have been masturbating so infrequently. Without going into too much detail, it says something when you have so much free time and you're not indulging in your favorite pastime.

I couldn't help but feel a little bit of pride when I watched the video where Coleslaw lit the new sign on the Gilman Bridge. 

It reminded me of that initial excitement I felt when touring UCSD about 4 years ago with my family. I don't think the bridge existed back then, but I do remember looking at the UC San Diego medical center sign in awe as we drove down the 5. Later, looking up at that towering library in its massive concrete structure, speechless. I wanted to go to UCLA, but guess who got rejected??! 

This turned out to be the place for me, given my major, and I couldn't be happier. (Except Ivy leagues maybe LOL)

It's a long, complex story, but I'm the first in my family to go to college in this country. I didn't have any forerunners to look up to, and because of circumstance, no close friends who'd give me advice either. I didn't even know that college essays were a thing until mid junior year of hs. So...

I feel blessed.

No matter how hard I work, I feel like I just cant seem to do well. During exams, I panic, and problems that i can solve normally take me 30 minutes ish. I use calculators to calculate stuff like 3\*5 because I have lost all confidence in my own abilities.

I have always loved academics. Math and Biology were things that, I quite frankly, were obsessed with. and my dream was to attend grad school and conduct research one day. I have never quite hated academics as much as I do now. Every morning, I wake up and I realize its another desperate meeting with the piles of work on my table, that I know i wont understand. I feel like an absolute failure. A disapointement to the professors who have worked so hard this year to educate students like me, and a disappointment to my parents, who paid so much to allow me to attend such an university. I feel as if i have no talent, and just frankly a useless person.

Sorry for all this negativity. Alot of the faults probably lie on myself. And i bet there are people in much worse conditions than me, so I really have no right to complain. But its 7 am here, I stayed up to do the physics quiz, messed up. and now, staring at the rising sun contrasting with the gloom and frustration of my room., I feel nothing but depression and sorrow, and an urge to rant. Apologies to everyone reading. Hope yall have a good day. Cheers."

I feel so overwhelmed. I feel like everyone in my classes are geniuses. Like one minute Im in GE classes and lower div classes with a healthy balance of whiz kids and ""decently smart"" kids who work hard. But BAM, I'm in all these upper div classes and straight up everyone in my class is a God.

For example, I'm in MATH 171A and that class is kicking my ass. I have no idea what the fuck is even going on, yet in the class discord kids are straight up toying with the class it seems. If you ask a question they respond with paragraph long responses like ""sure, all you have to do to find the active constraint is import library Z and then do X and Y, and set it to a negative lambda and realign the indices, easy!!

Like what the actual fuck. What happened? Am I just dumb? I feel total impostor syndrome and completely out of place. All I want to do at this point is pass my classes and graduate. Ive watched and rewatched the lectures for my classes and nothing is getting in my head, it all looks like weird symbols. Anyone else feel like this?

Worst part is that I might fail this class, and my graduation would be delayed so I'm hella stressed about that. Idk I just had to vent. Just feel so so stupid rn"

I've never really been lured by the idea of being in a relationship nor have I ever felt the need for one, or I guess I've managed to delude myself into thinking that is true. I guess you can say I'm happy, but lately I've felt so alone that I haven't even realized it. I have friends, a solid family, but somehow that isn't enough anymore. There's something else I'm missing and I came to the realization of what that was once I finished reading this one book. It's a little silly really, to want something that only exists in a fantasy book; love. I hate how cheesy that sounds, but it's true. I'm not talking about the love you get from a mother or even the love you'd feel for a close friend. I wish I knew what it is to fall in love, or be loved. I used to cringe at that idea, but truly I never actually understood what it meant. I still don't. And it wasn't until I finished reading that book this morning that I found myself yearning for something that probably doesn't even exists. I guess that's the beauty of books.

Perhaps I sound like a complete nerd, or a hopeless romantic, but I never actually thought about how beautiful it would be to experience something so real beyond attraction and lust. And it makes me feel alone and kind of miserable because I can't fathom the idea of ever finding something like that. It's like a void that I'll probably never fill because I don't even think I'd be able to handle such a thing in the first place. 

I'm sure other people feel the same way but still...it feels lonely."

Did you just forget them there, or were you hoping someone else would return them for you?

They've just been sitting there for almost a week so I went and returned them today cause it was just driving me crazy. I put the bag back where I found it so you can take it back if you want.

Again, I don't know why they were left over there... but if you hoped someone else would return them for you I really don't understand why it is so hard to do it yourself. This is a pretty simple and effective policy implemented to help reduce waste and so many of us are still so unable to follow through.

If I was at home, I was either sleeping or really tired. If I had any energy in my body, I'd be somewhere else. I'd be at Geisel, Price Center, those study lounges in Galbraith, even the bleachers at the soccer field next to Rady.

I couldn't study or work at home. Back in those days, I needed to be around other people, all working on something, and only then could I focus.

For better or worse, the pandemic has forced me to be more flexible with my study/work habits. I have been forced to get used to WFH. I have come to find advantages to it. No commutes, no parking delays, no taking the 150 bus from Regents/La Jolla Village, no waiting at the VA for disabled passengers to get on/off, and no walking down library walk to Geisel. That extra 15-20 minutes each way is more time for other stuff. And after a while, it adds up to a lot of time saved.

I think everyone's excited to meet their friends in person again. I was never much of a hugger, but I am very excited to hug my closest friends again. And of course, I'm excited to go out for food and drinks and all that stuff.

While I'm excited about things re-opening, I am afraid that a lot of days will be spent at home, simply because that will be an option, and it will be efficient. It will be lonely, and people might not realize they're lonely, since they'll be doing it by choice.

Maybe, and prayerfully, people will slowly get sick of WFH and will remember how they liked it better when they worked from Starbucks or Geisel.

I can't tell the future, but my general understanding of human nature makes me think this is what we might experience after the pandemic."

I'll admit I haven't done my very best but I also don't think it's fair to see that the grade average was close to 50%. Is this what college is like? Where half the class fails an exam and it's not something to be worried about? I've never done this bad in a class before, and I'm doing terribly in my other classes too. Even the class I thought would be my easy A is becoming a class I might have to p/np. If anything, it looks like all my classes will change to p/np. I feel like I wasn't trained to do this. I used to love school, I used to look forward to going to class and learning new things. Now, my test anxiety is getting worse and I'm adopting a pessimistic outlook on life and school. I took so many AP classes in high school and I thought I was a diligent student but after this quarter, I feel super worthless as a student and as a person.

Everyone on campus should be wearing two masks, one paper and one cloth but paper masks are super expensive at the price center Target. It's so weird though because I went to UTC early last quarter and many boutiques were offering free disposable masks on a table outside their store and thats what made it click in my head that the least UCSD should be providing on campus students. 

Bottom line is: I'm tired of personal protection equipment eating into my savings, when it LITERALLY IS WHAT KEEPS ME FROM GETTING A DEADLY VIRUS, I see a lot of people wearing one cloth mask and it makes me scared for them because a cloth mask does virtually nothing, and also I think UCSD should provide PPE to suites and apartments on campus in order to prevent or at least slow down the urge for **some** people to party their asses off."

But without further ado, with **1,506 reporting**:

# WebRej (Rhymes with ""ledge""): 826 (54.8%)

#WebReg (Rhymes with ""leg""): 671 (44.6%)

Is this a typical situation in the middle of Covid19 ? I wonder if this is a typical issue at this time. Currently I am far away from SD, so I cannot visit in person. In this case, if my messages continue to be ignored, do I have any options other than waiting?

Personally, the whole idea for me was that if I moved in after fall quarter I could have a better understanding of COVID once I was on campus in the later months AND that I would still be guaranteed housing next year. It was a huge factor in choosing whether or not to live on campus in the subsequent quarters because financially it wasn't ideal to move, but I still pushed for it because I was under the assumption it was going to give me some sort of priority for the coming year.

It's literally only a week until SIRs are due and I STILL can't decide where to go, so any insight on how accurate my pros/ cons list is, and any otheradvice from UCSD students would really help! The prices for all three schools for me about the same, as all three are in-state- tuition, so money is not a factor. 

Stuff like dorms, food, transportation, etc doesn't really matter to me. I care about the reputation, grad school, and job prospects, internships/ recruiting, fit for major, social scene, and classes not being too difficult so I can keep a good GPA.

&amp;#x200B;

UC San Diego: Major: International Business but I am thinking of changing to Business Economics or maybe something else 

Pros:

\* Best reputation- for grad schools and jobs

\* Prestige of UCSD validates my efforts in high school, otherwise, I kinda feel like it was all for nothing haha 

\* Near the beach- good for surfing

Cons:

\* Literally nicknamed UC Socially dead, that's how bad it is (this is the biggest con by far for me- I was really looking forward to a fun, traditional college experience) 

\* No traditional college experience and no football team

\* Heavily STEM focused, known for STEM majors

\* No college town, La Jolla is filled with older rich people 

\*No pure business major, which I was considering. Has business economics. The economics/ international business program is not well established as the other programs such as engineering are. I'm not sure how good the international business or business economics majors are. 

&amp;#x200B;

UC Davis: Undecided- college of agriculture and Environmental Sciences but I am thinking of changing to Business Economics or maybe something else 

Pros: 

\* Chill, friendly people

\* Lots of trees 

\* Has a college town

\* More social than UCSD, although I'm not sure how social it really is 

Cons:

\* It's just hard for me to get excited about it, it seems almost, underwhelming?

\* Too close to home

\* Don't like the surrounding area (Sacramento Area), and there isn't much to do outside of Davis itself, which is pretty small

\* No pure business major, known for STEM 

&amp;#x200B;

Cal Poly San Luis Obispo- Business Administration

&amp;#x200B;

Pros:

\* Learn by doing

\* Good business school and job prospects, companies recruit there because of the learn by doing

\* Lovely college town and a Beautiful campus near the beach

\* More Parties and more of a traditional College experience

\* School environment just fits me more

\* Seems more exciting

\* Smaller class sizes 

\* More focus on undergraduate teaching so teachers will give more attention, and classes will probably be easier than at a UC 

Cons:

\* I want to potentially move to Europe, and a UC would look much better applying to jobs over there. UC has international prestige, cal poly is unheard of past the west coast, as far as I know. Basically- poorer reputation. 

\* I have no idea what I want to do with my life and I will probably change my major at some point. I heard its much harder to change majors here and you spend less time taking general ed classes. I would want to take more general ed classes because I want to have more time to explore different subjects. 

\* It would not look nearly as good when applying to grad school as a UC school. I heard Cal Poly is more for people who want a job straight out of college, but I may want to go to grad school. 

\* Apparently many people here are ""fake"" and image-obsessed.

\* Lack of Diversity

&amp;#x200B;

I am also considering San Diego State and the University of Washington, but UW is out of state tuition so I probably shouldn't go there. 

Thank you again for your insight!

my83w4,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/my83w4/i_am_4_upper_division_credits_short_of_completing/,I am 4 upper division credits short of completing the Business Minor. Would they make an exception for me?,1,0,2021-04-25 06:15:22,"I will be graduating at the end of Spring 2021, and I will be 4 upper div credits short of completing the Business Minor.

Long story short, I decided to start the Business Minor in Winter 2020. I didn’t declare it, but I kept taking the required classes since Spring 2020. I am now a graduating senior and have completed all the Business Minor requirements, EXCEPT for one upper division elective.

I dropped the ball in several ways, but most importantly, I waited until my last quarter of undergrad to declare the minor, so I don’t have time to change anything unless I hang around for summer session.

I took MGT 137 as an elective last year, but that’s technically an accounting class. MAYBE it could fill the missing upper div requirement? It has a lot to do with business, since it specifically goes into forecasting and evaluating stock price. MGT 137 is not listed as an acceptable elective on the Business Minor webpage, so what are the chances they’d let it slide for me?

If I filed a petition and asked to be given Business Minor credit for MGT 137, what are the chances it would be approved by Rady?

I also emailed an advisor at Rady asking what they have to say."

Just wanted to draw attention to the milestone that about to surpass! 50,000 is such a crazy large number... and in terms of traffic stats, this subreddit gets over 3 million views a month typically. I know myself and the rest of the mods never would have imagined how fast this subreddit would grow. 

On a personal note, when I first started using this subreddit before the start of my first year in 2018, we only had around 12,000 subscribers. Now, 3 short years later we’re about to surpass 50,000. We passed more subscribers than students a long time ago and are only continuing to grow. 

In this time, this sub has been a great source of entertainment for me and many other students. From chicken sashimi to our feud with UCB to Gary memes, there has always been something interesting going on here. It’s been the go-to information source for a lot of people including myself, especially during the pandemic. 

Looking towards the future, I know myself and the rest of the mod team are looking forwards to continuing trying to make this sub a better place. Hopefully we’ll be able get some more AMAs to happen(if you are a professor or work in some student-facing capacity please message us if you’d be interested in an AMA!). In general, I think our goal is to make this subreddit a more positive place that still allows for the shitposts it is so well known for.

They also kept talking about sports which I have zero interest in

The sudden question of “is this what the rest of my life is going to be?” and thought of a mon-fri, 9-5 is making me spiral.

I refuse to let my life be wasted.

For those of you who wish to be done with school. Don’t. It’s only day one of 40+ years of having to do this everyday potentially. God. This is sucks.

Im just venting and I know I’m lucky to have a landed a decent laying job so soon. But please enjoy your college years at ucsd.

o1ku1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/o1ku1z/an_overdue_rant_about_osd/,An Overdue Rant About OSD,42,13,2021-06-16 18:20:01,"Hello! Going to preface that this is by no means a personal attack against anyone in particular. I really need to voice my situation and how I've been disappointed by the department as a student with disabilities in securing and maintaining my accommodations. Furthermore, my experiences are so solely of those from a person with ADHD. I cannot speak for everyone! I can only speak for myself.

&amp;#x200B;

A particular incident spurred on my issues with OSD. Before every quarter, OSD students are expected to contact their counselor in order for them to secure their accommodations. As a student with ADHD, I found doing so okay and found no issue in doing that. However, I found out how complicated doing so could be, despite my lifelong condition.

For context:  I have had diagnosed ADHD since I was 6, and severe ADHD at that. My situation with ADHD has remained the same for years.

As an anxious freshman, I contacted my counselor very early into the end of the fall quarter because I thought that I needed to have an interview with my counselor again to see if I was fit for accommodations for the next quarter. In response, I was told this was not true, and instead, was told my accommodations would be renewed without an interview. I was not expecting this response. However, I got my accommodations for the winter quarter and so I was okay.

The issue was, I was never told that I needed to contact my counselor to do so. Instead, I was in a situation where I was scared that I wasn't going to get them again (which I didn't want because they were helping me! And making school generally better to handle) and received them because I was incorrect.

Since I emailed so early, I did not receive a reminder about contacting my counselor to renew my accommodations. So, although the situation I found myself in was partially my fault, I was misled slightly.

I knew that I needed to contact my counselor before each quarter and I assumed that I would not need to renew anything. Instead, I thought that I would email my counselor and they would respond with the typical email explaining how to request accommodations through the OSD portal. However, to my own misfortune, I found out I was wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

As a student with ADHD now comfortable with the way things were working, I started getting a little lazy about accommodations in winter quarter. I thought it was okay to contact my counselor a little later than last time because my ADHD wouldn't change and I thought that I wouldn't be expected to turn in any new forms or be re-evaluated until the next school year.

On the weekend of spring break, I emailed my counselor. I knew that I wouldn't receive a response until that coming week, but I knew I'd be fine as nothing would change. I would get access to the OSD portal, and check off boxes, right?

Unfortunately, no. I would end up having to wait two weeks to secure the accommodations I have the legal right to access.

When I saw the email from my counselor, I was told that I would need to renew my forms. On the first day of school spring quarter. Without warning or explanation, my counselor wanted me to prove, once again, that I had diagnosed ADHD.  Despite the fact that I had no reason for my ADHD to discontinue or worsen/improve.

Now, I obviously did something wrong. I should've been a responsible adult who thought to contact their counselor earlier. I understood the fault on my end for this situation.

A few weeks prior, I had received an email reminding OSD students to contact their counselor in order to secure accommodations again.

The issue was, they decided to do so right in the middle of finals week. Although that isn't necessarily an excuse, there was a problem with said email.

Although it was a reminder on finals week, it said:

**""Remember:** **DO NOT** **wait until week 9 or 10 of the quarter to request your accommodations if you have had them in previous quarters; accommodations** **WILL NOT** **be provided retro-actively; if you have issues securing your accommodations with instructors, email your OSD Specialist** **IMMEDIATELY!""**

The issue was:

*1. I had never received this email before, as I was a silly anxious freshman who ended up in a situation that secured their accommodations unintentionally. I had never received said reminder before!!!!!! So, I assumed anytime was better than never.*

*2. Why are you reminding us to not wait until Week 9 or 10 when you're sending this email on ""Week 11""? Isn't that just irresponsible?*

I was stupid for putting this task at the back of my mind, however, there was clearly something going wrong here. Unrelated to me and my mistakes.

I found it weird they were choosing to remind us so late.

I also found it weird that I received no warning that my counselor wished for me to renew my forms. I understand asking a student with a temporary injury for this, but as a lifelong sufferer of ADHD, I felt that there was no purpose for this other than to possibly punish me for a dumb decision. I emailed back and forth a bit with my counselor explaining that I found this situation really frustrating and that I'd do my best to get my forms in a timely manner. I received sentence long responses, clearly lacking empathy or concern for the situation I was put into without my knowledge.

As a result of this abrupt news, I was put into a really unfortunate situation. I needed to contact my psychiatrist, who I met with 2 weeks prior (right during finals week and before this reminder email was sent), to send me new accommodation forms. I literally could have gotten these forms in time if someone at OSD cared to send an email in a timely manner. Maybe even an email that reflected their so-called warning for their students.

As a department solely devoted to students with disabilities, I would think they would think to remind their only responsibility appropriately????

ANYWAYS, it took me two weeks to receive the forms because of a lot of miscommunication and issues with the way things were run at this office.

So, two weeks into spring quarter, I finally received the forms. After a lot of effort on my end, I emailed them to my counselor.

Things seemed fine! It totally wasn't like I was about to start midterm season next week and I was scared that I wasn't going to receive my accommodations in time for my exams. My counselor told me they'd evaluate them next week. Which, how amazing.

I was content with dealing with the anxiety of possibly having no accommodations for said exams.

However, I then receive an email that they can't accept the forms because there is no date on them. I was a bit frustrated at my psychiatrist at first for making a silly mistake, but then I realized: **Why the fuck should a date make me unable to receive my accommodations? Furthermore, why the fuck do they think my diagnosis has changed? Of course it hasn't!!! My ADHD is as severe as it gets. WHY WAS I EVEN IN THIS SITUATION IN THE FIRST PLACE.**

Everything else was filled out!  All the important information regarding what actually mattered: my goddamn ADHD diagnosis.

Now, I can't blame those problems on OSD. That was just an unfortunate situation I found myself in. However, there is clear bureaucratic bullshit going on here. I will never blame this entire situation on OSD. In a lot of places, there was fault on both my end and my psychiatrist's. However, OSD clearly needs to get their shit together!

My grievances are:

1. You should be more clear with students about when they should be contacting their counselors. Not on finals weeks! Email us at the beginning of the quarter, or if that's too much, possibly the end. Don't expect us to be on top of everything. **I can only speak for myself as a person with ADHD for this, but as much as I like to tell myself that I'm responsible, I have my shortcomings. Please, for the love of god, remind your students. I can only imagine students who have more difficult situations than mine probably have a more difficult time than ME in trying to stay on top of everything, including access to our ACCOMMODATIONS.**
2. Unless a legitimate reason is provided as to why a student must renew forms (beyond yearly),then do not torture your fucking students just to punish them. I know that turning in new forms didn't help anyone. The information on the paper pertaining to my actual condition clearly didn't matter more than a fucking date. Spare the anxiety and stress of your students with disabilities. Consider that they too are human and make mistakes. I never got an explanation. Instead, I was given this information on the spot and expected to deal with it instantly.
3. If you decided to continue with your sadistic bullshit of asking students who clearly have had no change in their condition for new forms, PLEASE. PLEASE. tell them in a timely manner. NOT WHEN IT FEELS CONVENIENT TO YOU. (Of course, I understand that counselors may have 100s, or possibly 1000s of students to deal with at once. However, since the OSD department likes to make it seem as though the relationship between student and counselor is individual, FUCKING ACT THAT WAY or continue receiving these rants that come from a place of concern for myself and other students with disabilities.
4. Don't place all of the burden of this department on the students. This arrangement should be equal, if not partially more on the students. Instead, I felt as though I was supposed to deal with everything on my own. No one willing to sympathize or understand how frustrating this situation was.
5. You shouldn't be asking students with lifelong conditions to do this. What the fuck is wrong with you.

I'm lucky that things ended up okay and I got my accommodations within the next week. However, I can only imagine that this bullshit has impacted other students as much or even greater than me. I can imagine that there have been students who did not have as ideal of a situation in getting forms, contacting their medical providers, and instead were fucked over because OSD has a stick up their ass. They were likely denied accommodations they NEED to receive an education as fairly as any able-bodied individual does.

So, my ultimate issue with OSD is that the ableism REAKS from them. **DO YOU EVEN CARE ABOUT YOUR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES? OR ARE YOU GOING TO CONTINUE TO FUCK THEM OVER LIKE I WAS.**

I have had to make some adjustments in order to avoid such a fucked situation again. I've told myself that I need to ask for a new accommodation form whenever I meet with my psychiatrist. If I don't, I fear that I'll end up in this same situation, wishing that something would change.

Funny enough, I asked for accommodations forms again to get started on this resolution the other week.  I explained the situation to my doctor and he too was really confused about the situation. He saw no reasoning in asking for new forms more than once a year. If my doctor sees the issue in this, he and I are likely not the only people finding issues with it.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, you may be asking: why aren't you making a formal complaint?

Honestly, I probably should. This situation was awful and I honestly thought to change counselors or speak with a higher up to get this issue fixed. Maybe I'll decide to do that soon.

&amp;#x200B;

But regardless, I feel really violated by the way OSD treated me.

And a warning for other students with disabilities receiving accommodations through OSD: **Although this department was created to represent you, you likely need to fend for yourself and assume the worst when approaching it.**

I will continue to receive my accommodations through them because I fucking deserve them! However, I will be assuming that I need to bear the complete burden of acquiring them in the future.

**TLDR;** So, to OSD. Please fix your shit. I'm tired.

&amp;#x200B;

Love,

A very disgruntled student with ADHD &lt;/3"

I asked someone else (edit: two other people) who I know got the vaccine at UCSD and they had the same issue.

I’ve just applied to a place on my own and assuming I get accepted, am I allowed to add another person AFTER that time? 

I believe I qualify on my own (hence why I applied) but with the rent hikes I had the idea to rent out the living room or add a room mate to decrease the amount I’d pay individually. 

Assuming I even get accepted, can someone tell me whether or not this is something feasible? The application itself says each applicant must submit their own app, and you have to include the names on your application as usual- but I submit it without the intent to share the place. In general, if it differs between management companies, how would I go about asking if this is something they allow? Or is this a legal matter that I shouldn’t even consider it at all? If you couldn’t tell, I’m a newbie so any help navigating this would be super appreciated. The desperate feeling is sinking in heavily LOL.

Individuals are encouraged to submit documentation and requests as soon as possible. Requests for exception or deferral must be received no later than September 2, 2021.

## Masking Policy Updated

**Everyone, regardless of vaccination status,** [**must wear a mask or face covering**](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__t.e2ma.net_click_zvayge_zz1tm4ec_z34mmk&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=-35OiAkTchMrZOngvJPOeA&amp;r=_fzi0TbbQx-cUctqhC4M33qgyqb1x-TSe2yNP8a45PQ&amp;m=OyKT7wXwRwUgHeFdskbNdz2NkVmfaaDEIqfbPOpNTq0&amp;s=lGEngmeIDNSVoeKbM8qbWtR3nci2IrePN11X2igMtaM&amp;e=) **at all indoor locations at UC San Diego**, except while eating and drinking. The exception to this rule would be for a single individual in an office with a closed door. To be effective, masks must cover both the nose and the mouth.   
Students moving into campus housing must agree to Phase 1 and Phase 2 safety protocols, which include masking requirements. During Phase 1, residents will be required to wear masks in their residential units, except in their personal bedroom or while showering. Residents will be notified when campus housing moves into Phase 2, at which time residents will no longer be required to mask within their suite or apartment. All students, faculty and staff are encouraged, but not required, to wear masks outdoors while on campus. Attendees at outdoor campus events must wear a face mask if required by the event organizer.

## Daily Screening

All UC San Diego employees and students who are reporting to campus or any other physical UC San Diego location must complete and submit a daily self-screening for COVID-19. Students will need to [register once](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__t.e2ma.net_click_zvayge_zz1tm4ec_vo6mmk&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=-35OiAkTchMrZOngvJPOeA&amp;r=_fzi0TbbQx-cUctqhC4M33qgyqb1x-TSe2yNP8a45PQ&amp;m=OyKT7wXwRwUgHeFdskbNdz2NkVmfaaDEIqfbPOpNTq0&amp;s=Moy5kDydjpws7nGsheF4b55BY6HZiyGupcjWI9p9N8M&amp;e=) before [completing the daily student self-screening](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__t.e2ma.net_click_zvayge_zz1tm4ec_bh7mmk&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=-35OiAkTchMrZOngvJPOeA&amp;r=_fzi0TbbQx-cUctqhC4M33qgyqb1x-TSe2yNP8a45PQ&amp;m=OyKT7wXwRwUgHeFdskbNdz2NkVmfaaDEIqfbPOpNTq0&amp;s=AWgbxPLKqTXQ8-QedGKaqDHbMH6xMEWqGBZclwWEFd8&amp;e=).

## Asymptomatic Testing

At the present time, asymptomatic *vaccinated* students, faculty, and staff are permitted, but not required, to test weekly, if they choose.   
**Students moving into on-campus housing are required to complete an in-person COVID-19 test prior to move-in** to identify and isolate any asymptomatic individuals who could unintentionally spread the virus. Testing will be conducted in areas convenient to residence halls as part of the 10-day, staggered move-in process. Additional tests are required on Day 5 and 10 after move-in. More information about Fall Quarter move-in is available on the [HDH website](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__t.e2ma.net_click_zvayge_zz1tm4ec_718mmk&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=-35OiAkTchMrZOngvJPOeA&amp;r=_fzi0TbbQx-cUctqhC4M33qgyqb1x-TSe2yNP8a45PQ&amp;m=OyKT7wXwRwUgHeFdskbNdz2NkVmfaaDEIqfbPOpNTq0&amp;s=C1TG0JaHvDpo5ZjnDOpIpa5591NX5nNB9zA9W7fgUO4&amp;e=).  
**All individuals who have received an approved exemption or deferral to the mandatory vaccination policy must complete asymptomatic testing at least twice weekly.** Tests must be taken not more than 5 days apart. Find locations for ongoing asymptomatic testing locations on campus on the [Return to Learn website](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__t.e2ma.net_click_zvayge_zz1tm4ec_nu9mmk&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=-35OiAkTchMrZOngvJPOeA&amp;r=_fzi0TbbQx-cUctqhC4M33qgyqb1x-TSe2yNP8a45PQ&amp;m=OyKT7wXwRwUgHeFdskbNdz2NkVmfaaDEIqfbPOpNTq0&amp;s=lgO1BZKgyO5Z3XTZG1bXaOdvAD3rRdPwuvER3pfGTXI&amp;e=). 

## Special Events

**Indoor Events**  
**Indoor events are temporarily not allowed through October 31, 2021**, unless by Vice Chancellor exception using the formal event approval process. Indoor events that can be convened virtually should be held online. Classes are not considered events and will be conducted primarily in person, with all individuals expected to comply with the updated masking policy.    
**Outdoor Events**  
Outdoor events, while still permitted at this time, should be considered carefully to avoid large crowds. Event organizers are encouraged to consider requiring face coverings for their outdoor events, although doing so is not required at this time. For outdoor events where food and beverages will be served, buffets are not allowed. Boxed snacks or plated meals, and individual beverages, may be enjoyed outdoors when participants are physically-distanced from one another.All visitors and guests at UC San Diego onsite events must be vaccinated or have a recent negative COVID-19 test and will be expected to provide proof of vaccination or provide a recent negative COVID test (within the last 48 hours) for event participation."""

I thought we would genuinely be okay. I’m graduating in the winter, and he’s graduating in the spring. It was really only 7 months more until we could close the distance. To be fair, we were mostly apart due to the pandemic with him being in San Diego and me in the Bay Area, but I guess he just got lost in the independency. I am still so in love with him so I’ve been struggling. He was my best friend. 

I visited him in San Diego after we broke up for closure because we still loved each other but the distance was too hard for him. La Jolla really is beautiful. We went to the aquarium and the beach and tried out different foods. The seafood there hits different. The day with him felt like a dream I didn’t want to wake up from. The bus ride wasn’t even that bad. Granted, the AC didn’t work and it was packed in there, but it honestly felt like it didn’t matter because it was leading me to him. 

Would honestly just love to hear people talk about their LDR and their experience. I’m really sad so I’d love to hear happy success stories, whether that be between UCSD-UCLA or other places :) I shall live vicariously through you and what could have been if he just tried."

I am a Chinese. Here's my observations on some posts(correct me if Im wrong): 

1) due to rising tension between US and China, more people think ccp is just like Big Brother. 

while in reality, ccp does get more assertive these days but not as bad as some think. tons of higher educated people have access to vpn and most of time the ccp does not give a fck about any individual's words unless that individual works for the government. 

2) imao, most Chinese don't care about politics that much. I assume those Chinese who attack people saying negative things about China are not majority. bc majority would remain silent (fear get attacked) or probably just unaware of issues. 

3) imao, most Chinese judge on facts and not that sensitive about other's negative opinions on China as long as they provide solid evidence.

I'm an incoming freshman majoring in molecular and cell biology in revelle college and I had a few things I wanted to ask about and didn't feel like making multiple threads so I'll just post it all here. 

First off, how hard is it to get a single dorm? I ask because I really enjoy living individually and having my personal space. Don't get me wrong I love to socialize and everything, but I feel like living with someone would be really limiting.

Second, how realistic would it be to bring my car with me? Personally, I don't mind parking off campus/buying a parking pass of an upperclassman but I just wanted to get a sense of how that would work.

Third, I received a small scholarship check through the mail and it's addressed to the student services center. How would I be able to cash it in? Also would it just deduct from my tuition and would I actually see the money.

Thanks for taking the time to read this and for any help that y'all provide. If anyone else goes to revelle or even has the same major feel free to reach out to me, I'm always open to meeting new people."

I was talking to a friend who mentioned that we could purchase parking permits right now, so I went ahead and purchased an SR permit despite living off-campus (S permits weren't an option, and D permits have notoriously terrible parking). In hindsight, this was my first red flag. I recently learned that the permits available currently are meant for the summer sessions. However, I was still able to purchase my SR permit for the duration of the Fall quarter (personally 74 days).

I was wondering if I should contact the transportation office in hopes of a refund, or if I should keep the SR permit despite living off-campus, as I figure it would still work as a legitimate permit. Would the school catch me on this later on, since my housing portal says I live off-campus? Should I reissue my permit for morality's sake? To my understanding, S permits are really bad now, only allowing 40-day parking, so I'm reluctant to miss out on this loophole.

If it is likely you guys aren't gonna meet again there are two reasons to approach them:

1. This is your only chance
2. If you get rejected, who cares. You're not gonna see them again

I know it's easier said than done, but what do you really have to lose? A few seconds worth of embarrassment? And if it works? The rewards outweigh the risks. 

Just take a deep breath and go for it. It's better than regretting it and replaying the scenario with what-ifs afterwards.

If it's someone that you are going to see regularly, then try to befriend them first. It's much easier and less awkward this way. If you get to know them, maybe you figure out they aren't for you. Cool, at least you have a new friend.

I'm not some sort of pick up artist or anything, but I can confidently say that approaching someone and whatever happens afterwards is much better than the regret of not doing anything at all. Even in the case of rejection, I made some new friends and laugh about the situation time to time.

Do not ever stay in a working environment that make you feel unhappy and stressed. Research is hard enough, you need to feel supported and be respected by people surrounding you. If things are bad, they won’t get better. I was told, I didn’t listen, and now I paid the price for it. Believe me.
Do not ever let other people belittling you. Do not ever let other people damage your love and enthusiasm for sciences. Over put yourself and your mental health first. Keep trusting in yourself.

Moreover, even if I ask a question to a tutor they say I need to google more to confirm my answer. I felt really bad for this because what is the purpose of asking questions that were not on the lab handout or lecture session?

I was originally planning on doing 18 with CHEM 6B (4), MATH 10A (4), HUM 1 (6), and BILD 1 (4) until I spontaneously decided to take BILD 81 (1), BILD 83 (1), and BILD 92 (1) just because they seemed interesting. Someone named Steven Briggs is teaching both of those last electives I mentioned, but he's not on RMP so I'm unsure whether or not I'm screwing myself over."
