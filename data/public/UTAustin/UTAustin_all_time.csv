I'm considering founding a new student organization at UT and I'd like to know whether or not y'all think it will be a success.

I'm envisioning a social club for introverts. I want to create a calming atmosphere where people who have a difficult time opening up/making friends can socialize without feeling pressured. I'd like to encourage (not push, but simply motivate) my fellow introverts to share their passions with others, because I believe that mutual, passionate energies among introverts is what can connect us. I want a place where introverts can be a part of a supportive community that empowers them to excel in college, and encourages them to play an active role in bettering both their own lives, and the lives of others.

This might just be me talking, but I feel as if colleges in general often forget and ignore their introverted students. Unlike many extroverts who can socialize and build connections at ease, introverts tend to perceive the act of creating social bonds as intimidating. Since colleges don't often lend a supportive hand to their introverted students, I want to be the one who does.

Whether we will be quietly watching a movie, laughing as we play video games, or smiling contently as we volunteer at our local animal shelter, I want all of us to do it together and feel comfortable being together.

Please let me know what you think or if you have any ideas for possible activities an introverted social club could engaged in.

tl;dr I'm thinking about create a college social club for introverts. Your thoughts?"

1. If I sent in my housing app last week (my understanding is that it was probably a bit late to), is it possible to still get availability to live in San Jac? I suppose Duren is alright since it's also kinda new with private bathrooms and close to the Student Services Building &amp; The Drag but it is a bit far from the PCL, DKR, and Gregory.

60vbmd,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/60vbmd/psa_about_pf_and_qdrops/,PSA about P/F and Q-Drops,49,5,2017-03-22 08:33:41,"PSA!

**Anyone wanting to Q-drop a class this semester (or change grading to Pass/Fail) needs to go to the advising center for their major and fill out a Q-drop form by Monday, April 3 (that's NEXT NEXT MONDAY FYI).** 

If you want to drop a class after 4/3, you will have to use your OTE (One Time Exception) which as the name implies, can only be used once. An OTE will still read as a Q on your transcript. You will not be able to P/F the class after 4/3 at all.

Unfortunately, there are a bunch of rules in place which can be confusing for new students. Most of these rules are the result of state laws and pressure to increase four-year graduation rates. I tried to compile the rules as best I know them below. They may not be 100% right so please double-check all policies.

**Q DROPS**

1. Double majors will need a signature from both of their majors' advising centers to Q-drop a class. 

2. International students will need a signature from the international office to Q-drop a class.

3. Every college does Q-drops differently. Some may only require a signature from a peer adviser working at the desk. Some may require a signature from an academic adviser, peer adviser, AND the Dean's office so there could be wait times involved. It's in your best interest to initiate this process ASAP especially if you are a double major or international student.

4. You get 6 Q-drops in you academic career (unless you have an exemption) due to state law. This means even if you transfer schools, your drop count will follow you!

5. Students considering a medical withdrawal or course reduction need to talk to the dean's office for their major. After April 3, you will need extra documentation to complete the appeal and it becomes harder. 

6. All pre-health professions students (e.g.  pre-meds, pre-dents, pre-PA, etc.) thinking of dropping classes (ESPECIALLY PRE-REQS FOR PROFESSIONAL SCHOOL) should look at this [link](https://cns.utexas.edu/images/CNS/Health_Professions/To_Q_or_Not_To_Q_Mar2013.pdf) and consider going in to talk to HPO during their Wednesday walk-ins.   

7. Drop before 4/3 or 3/31 if you can. The lines start to get long!

8. If you're dropping a course (especially if you go under 12-hours i.e. full time student status), it may affect your financial aid, housing, and even insurance rates. Talk to the financial aid office, your RA, and/or your parents if that's a concern for you.

9. PLEASE NOTE! Students in certain colleges like CNS or McCombs cannot repeat classes they got a C- or better in. If you are in that C-range and you plan to retake the class for GPA or graduate school purposes, drop the class or P/F it. You won't be able to repeat the class again if you earn a C, and that C will sit on your transcript. 
Also keep in mind that even if you drop the class, you can only enroll in a given course twice so you need to try and pass it with a good grade the second time you take it or you will need permission for subsequent attempts. 


**PASS/FAIL**

1. If you P/F the class, it cannot count towards any degree requirements except for total number of hours and possibly electives. You will need to repeat the class for a letter grade to complete your degree.

2. Most colleges limit students to taking 16 hours P/F.  Double check your college's requirements. 

3. Do not P/F a class that you are at risk for getting an F in. The F WILL be factored into your GPA as a 0.00 which is no bueno.

4. As far as I know, you do not need signatures from both colleges if you're a double major to P/F a class.

5. You must have 30 hours to take a class Pass/Fail. You can only P/F 2 classes per semester.

6. [EDIT] Not all classes can be taken P/F. Certain language classes come to mind. Check the course's description in the course schedule to verify if your class can be taken P/F. 


*This isn't meant to be a substitute to talking to your adviser. This is based on the most current information that I'm aware of. Please check your individual college and/or department's policies by consulting its website or calling its advising center.*

That's all! If anyone has questions, corrections, or additions, let me know!

I'm currently a junior math  major even though it's not what I want to do because I don't enjoy math at all. I've finished all the courses for BFP though. I've brought my GPA up since freshman year and it's not too terrible (3.1). However, I'm behind so I'm going to have to stay an extra year. I've been to two career fairs and haven't had any luck because I've made an awkward fool of myself both times. 

That leads me to my second issue.

I've grown up with anxiety. I skip class if I'll be late and everyone will stare at me. If I do get myself to go, I'd show up with heat flashes and sweat profusely. I'm also very clumsy, kind of socially awkward, and can't consistently speak without a stutter. Before I register for a class, I check past syllabi to see if there are any presentations because public speaking is one of my biggest fears. 

I can't hold a conversation at all let alone a conversation with an employer. My verbal communication skills are terrible even when trying to communicate very basic things.

One positive thing about me is that I'm pretty fit and knowledgeable and consistent with weight training but that's about it. I do have a close group of friends here but I've known them for years since before college.

I'm very scared for the future and I feel very hopeless. In the back of my mind I've always thought of going to UHS mental health services but I'm unsure about it.

With the release of Competitive Season 4 and the continued funding of Rocket League E-Sports, there is significant potential for country wide collegiate competition similar to what is done with League of Legends. So in that vein, would anyone be interested in forming an E-sports RL team for collegiate competition. We could hypothetically join a country wide organization for collegiate RL teams such as in this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/5yn8z6/introducing_the_rocket_league_collegiate/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link

The main purpose of this post is, however, to generally survey UT students for interest in a campus club. That is the first step toward joining a country-wide RL organization.

I was the original creator of the main UT austin sublets group on FB. I made the original rules that are still used today (the tagging and whatnot), and you can still find the original source for the bot I wrote to help admin it early on here as proof - https://github.com/hzsweers/fb_mod_bot

The group has been taken over by people pushing some site called Leaseful. When I say taken over, they removed other admins without notice. They pretty clearly push Leaseful in the description, and while it's already disappointing to see sponsorship on the page (something I vehemently rejected offers for when I ran it), they do not disclose that _they own Leaseful_ as well. It's super shady, and frankly a shit thing to do to ~~fellow~~ students. 

Despite the staunch defense [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/62n50d/housing_subletting_and_roommate_resources/dfo3z89/), the admins never updated their wording to be transparent. I commented as such on the group, and was subsequently banned.

So that's unfortunate, but I guess that's the kind of aggressive behavior they feel they need to make their startup successful. Anyway - just want to make sure there was a record, rather than the doctored content of the feed there. There are worrisome implications of sponsorship there, especially by the admins' own company. It would be very easy to just remove posts linking competitors.

Goldsmith Hall 310 Inner Campus Drive

Criminal Trespass: The University of Texas has approximately 170 call boxes installed around campus. One of these call boxes is well known to officers as the one that a certain person presses to ask to go to jail. This particular suspect has been issued 25 criminal trespass warnings. In fact, UTPD officers have been encountering this individual for so long, that all of the officers who encountered him the first time have long since retired. In this case, as in all the previous ones, the suspect activated an emergency callbox without good cause. Then, in his own way, he asked officers to take him to jail. Officers were happy to oblige the request. He was issued a fresh criminal trespass warning and transported to the local jail. This trip to jail marked his 23rd arrest for criminal trespass at UT. Until next time, sir. Occurred on 04/17/17 at 01:31 am.
 
Pickle Research Center 10100 Burnet Road
 
Driving While Intoxicated: A UTPD Security Guard observed an individual passed out in the driver’s seat of a vehicle at the entrance to the campus. The guard also observed that the vehicle appeared to have fresh damage. Officers arrived and confirmed that the driver was indeed passed out. They also observed that he smelled strongly of alcohol. The officers ultimately woke the driver but reported that he had a great deal of difficulty staying awake. The driver told officers that he only drank one beer. If he was telling the truth it must have been an absolutely massive beer to result in that level of intoxication. After performing poorly on the usual tests, the driver was transported to the local jail where we’re told they serve no beer at all. Occurred on 04/18/17 at 04:43 am.
 
600 Block of W. 30th Street
 
Driving While Intoxicated/Driving While License Invalid-No Insurance: A UTPD officer observed a vehicle that was driving erratically and nearly struck a bicyclist. The officer pulled the vehicle and spoke with the driver. The officer was able to detect the odor of alcohol on the breath of the driver. The driver told officers that he had “a couple of drinks.” Those drinks must have disagreed with the driver’s palate because was covered in his own vomit. Everyone’s a critic. The driver performed very poorly on the usual tests and was transported to Travis County Central Booking where he was given a very nice set of striped jail clothes to replace his soiled attire. Occurred on 04/17/17 at 12:58 am."

When you walk into a toilet stall and see the seat down, pick it the hell up. Use your shoe to pick it up if you don't want to get your hands dirty. Put some effort into it. 

Because guess what, some people don't have the time to wipe down your fucking droplets of piss before they have to blow. Yes, I have IBS, as does another 5% of the US population. And you people are like terrorists to us. An extra ten seconds to rip off a sheet of toilet paper and wipe down the seat means walking out of the bathroom with a pair of underwear or not. 

But the question is really this. Why are you even in the stall in the first place if you are taking a whiz only? Based on the locations in which I find urine on the seat (every single bathroom), I seriously doubt all the urinals were taken. If you have to go pee only, you use a urinal. We don't care if you have a micro penis or you're still trying to tame a chub, you use the fucking urinal to go pee. Guess what? We laugh even harder when we see someone use a stall to just go pee. Grow the hell up and face your insecurities.

So, I recently transferred to UT from a CC in Houston which I know is a big jump in terms of academic rigor, but I've always considered myself relatively smart and hard working and so therefore I didn't expect to be in the predicament I'm currently in at UT. Coming here has eroded my confidence in my academic prowess and all other as aspects of life as well. I study but still somehow bomb tests like I didn't know anything and the papers I've written this semester have been heavily critiqued by my TA, which is sad since I consider myself a strong writer; that being the reason I got into UT. Socially, I've been able to make friends and meet people but they just haven't stuck. Many of them already have friends they've been with for awhile. Lastly, the only positive thing about my experience at UT is that I've learned that apparently I'm ""emotional"" which might seem negative at first glance but I've asked childhood friends and they confirmed that it's true, so I'm working on it.

Sorry for the long vent but I just had to give you guys an idea of where I coming from. I don't really think any academic advice is needed because I've heard it all, but feel free to input. 

I think what would help me most, is hearing some stories of turning failures into success, or motivational encouragement and reassurance that I made the right choice. If you've read my entire post and don't believe UT is the place for me, let me know, I can handle it.

I'd just like to remind everyone how dangerous misinformation is at a time of crisis.

If the attacker really did target Greek life and it is backed up by more than just rumor, please share! It's valuable information to share if verified.

I've done all of that. The problem is, no one is interested in being friends with me. I try to build friendships by first getting someone's number or snapchat or whatever, and then texting them, planning to ask them to hang out sometime after we've talked for a while. The problem is, none of them show any interest in even talking to me. Whenever I text them, it's always me having to push the conversation and ask questions and change topics or whatever. If I ever say something like ""lol"", then the conversation ends. The other person makes no effort to try to continue the conversation. This has happened to everyone I've talked to my freshman year. No one actually talks to me outside of class/org activities, it's just me talking and them responding. So I just stop trying with them.

I started my freshman year excited and extroverted. Now I'm just lonely. I'm scared of trying to make friends anymore. I think I'm depressed. I'm going to go to therapy at CMHC next semester. What else should I do...

My circumstances were that my dad was no longer able to help pay tuition anymore. So I had trouble adjusting to that. I don't think that's an extreme circumstance but I did make the case that I only have one year left in the program and I'm confident I can raise my grades up next year. 

So after much deliberation they accepted my appeal. I was very thankful because if they would have kicked me out of school my future livelihood would be radically different. Not only would I be screwed career wise, but I'd have to tell my girlfriend that I just got kicked out of school. She would surely breakup with me.

 I never told her I was on academic probation because I was very scared of how she would react. I don't know if that makes me a bad person or not but I guess I just wasnt man enough to do it. She wouldn't be able to relate at all. She's pretty successful, as she just graduated and landed an $80k a year job. So yeah I just wanted to get that off my chest. I feel like I literally just dodged a bullet, or a nuclear bomb. Wow!

tldr; academic probation. I appealed. They accepted the appeal. Never confided in my girlfriend about it. Literally no one knows."

Traditional) was best. It helped me so I'll share it!

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/710J9zi.png)'s my calculations for 2017-2018 for CNS students. I'm comparing the two tuition plans over the course of four years, with the final cost in bold. The fixed plan column is on the left and the right columns are the traditional plan at different interest rates. The savings column represents how much you lose (red) or save (green) by choosing fixed over traditional at that interest rate. I also added the cost after the [rebates](https://tuition.utexas.edu/rates/undergraduate/rebates) UT offers since I thought most people would be able to get them (and btw, fixed tuition gives you 2.5k more money if you graduate in 4 years on top of the 1k). I made a bunch of test-columns because I can't find the predicted interest rates for the next four years. help

So, in summary:

1. Without rebates, you only start saving money once tuition increases somewhere between 5 to 7% every year, meaning you lose money under fixed if rates aren't that high. **Choose traditional if you think you won't qualify for the rebate, and if rates won't be at least 5-7% high.** 
2. With rebates, you break even at a 1.28% interest rate (at least for CNS, should be similar for most colleges), which is reasonable. **Choose fixed if you think you can graduate in 4 years and will get the rebate, and if tuition interest rates are above 1.5%, which they probably will be and rising.**

You get a lower threshold for the interest rate if you get the rebate, so try to aim for that and **CHOOSE FIXED**, since you only need a predicted rate of 1.5% or higher to save money, which is easy. Remember that you will have to deal with the stress of limiting your hours, drops, failures, etc.

I don't know if this makes sense. I'm only a math major. Here's the link to the spreadsheet that you can use for your own colleges and future years: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rOUqfpSCSJRrdrqdNmhX2vohZXmxONzBwx_5zysNpiM/edit#gid=597955253."

Why can't UT allow such unofficial transcript be printed from UTDirect portal? They say ""security"". This baffles me because most schools allows for an unofficial copy readily printable in PDF format online (Heck, even Texas A&amp;M  does it). 


The only options you have are:

*  Get a physical copy of your Academic Summary that you'll have to physically pick-up with an ID. 

* Pay $20 for an official transcript. (There's no option for unofficial transcript. The unofficial ones are only for those with barred financial records.)

* Print your ""Grade Report"" via UTDirect -- which I don't advocate because it only shows grades for one semester, and it's not very presentable. 



I advocate the very first one. Pick up an Academic Summary, scan it or take a photo, then email it to yourself, so you'll have an electronic copy. 

P.S. If you're still a student, I urge you to contact your Student Government to allow future you and other future students to benefit from a ""printable PDF Unofficial Transcript"".  It's 2017, and almost all schools are able to provide unofficial transcripts readily available online for free.

First off, I wanna point out how awesome the new bike lanes on Rio, cyclist no longer have to fight drivers for lanes and the road is actually smooth. 

But with the good, there's always the bad. This is a traffic issue, mainly aimed towards drivers that are turning left going north on Rio, which crosses over the bike lanes. I experienced this firsthand today, on Rio &amp; 24 going north around 7pm, a metallic gray mazda sedan just turned left onto 24th without even looking to see if there was someone there (Not to mention he didn't even have a signal on, or I would've slowed down until he was done turning). Luckily, I was able to quickly steer in the same direction with the driver, and yelled at him, who still didn't realize that there was a bike going in parallel with him the whole time. 

So, I just want to warn both drivers **AND** cyclists, to look both ways on every road that intersects with Rio, but 24 &amp; Rio especially, since it's such a high traffic area. "

6umskp,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/6umskp/how_ut_admissions_works/,How UT Admissions Works,37,21,2017-08-18 20:18:33,"Hey everyone,

So I want to start this off by saying that I am not absolutely certain admissions works in the manner that I will be pointing out, however I am very confident. Please let me know if you disagree and provide evidence for the reason. Internal transfers are not included because admission is dictated by major/school and not by admissions.  

We all know that the University ranks students on two things, known as an ""Achievement Index"" and a ""Personal Achievement Index"". Kevin Martin (old UT admissions counselor) has said this before, as well as UT itself when [This well known lawsuit came along.](http://dailycaller.com/2016/06/23/in-compromise-scotus-upholds-affirmative-action/) Per Kevin Martin and and a high ranking admissions counselor I spoke with personally, this PAI lumps together your essays, letters of recommendation, and resume and ranks it on a scale of 1-6. Very few applicants (less than 2%) score a 6 on this index.

I believe that the rest of the application, which we can safely call the Achievement Index, is automated. For freshman applicants, it would include percentile ranking, GPA, or both, test scores, IS, OOS, INT and possibly race. For externals, this AI would include GPA, IS, OOS, INT and possibly/possibly not race.You would be assigned a certain variable on these three factors, and you would need to meet a certain threshold for you PAI to receive entry into your first choice. For instance, if I made a 28 on my ACT and graduated in the 85th percentile of my class with a 3.75 GPA, I may need a 6 on the PAI to be admitted to Computer Science, but only a 4 to be admitted to my second choice Economics. Same goes for externals, except of course test scores are not included. Keep in mind that multiple admissions officers assign you a PAI (this is proven), however I do not know how many and it would be silly to estimate. Let me know what youguys think.

EDIT: I suppose the biggest point this proves is that you will NOT get accepted to UT no matter how good your essays, EC's, and LOR are if your GPA and test scores aren't good enough. Where as with a school like Stanford, UPenn, etc, this may not be the case. 

Another point:

* The college you are externally transferring from is completely irrelevant in the admissions process, ~~and although I have no proof I have heard the high school is irrelevant.~~ thanks to the replies, it seems extremely likely high school is irrelevant as well. This of course backs up my claim because this would add an unnecessary and extremely difficult part to the algorithm if it were relevant in the admissions process. ~~If the high school is irrelevant in determining admission, than GPA is likely just taken into account for freshman and not percentile since that is clearly the most fair.~~ It seems that percentile ranking may be utilized rather than GPA for freshman applicants, which seems very unfair. This is not proven though. 

* This is quite obviously the most effective way to sort applicants. UT gets a ridiculous amount of applicants each year, and it makes sense for a system like this to sort the applicants.

I'm in Jester West, on a renovated floor, and my room is pretty nice, things are quiet overall, and the free laundry is great. However, one thing baffles and infuriates me: these shitty fucking showers. 

What irritates me most of all is that there is no apparent rhyme or reason as to why the showers are as erratic as they are. In the short time that I've been here, I've taken far more cold showers than I ever had in the rest of my life. I truly don't understand it. 

I heard from my RA that since I'm on a higher floor, sometimes it takes a while for the hot water to reach our showers. I thought okay, I'll try waiting after turning the water on. Nope, that doesn't do anything. If it's still cold within the first minute of turning the showers on, it'll stay that way for as long as I'm in there. 

My roommate and I thought about the possibility that the hot water was simply being used up, (which shouldn't be an issue for a university as modern as UT, but I digress), so we tried taking showers at different times during the day. Nope, I've taken cold showers at 7 AM, 9 AM, 5 PM, 8 PM, 10 PM, etc. There's no logic to it.

I read about a tip that turning on multiple showers can help route hot water to my bathroom more quickly, so I've done that on multiple occasions. Nope, no difference. 

On top of all this, I can take a freezing cold shower, walk to my room that's 10 feet away, turn on the faucet, and get hot water straight away. It makes no sense. 

So can someone tell me why a university with the second-largest endowment in the country that charges $900+ a month for students to live there can't provide goddamn hot water to its inhabitants? I mean holy shit, this isn't some community college in the middle of nowhere.

I'd prefer to poop in private without people washing their hands seeing my huddled body over the toilet via the mirror or the weird kid that makes full on eye contact with me checking the door while I'm letting loose. 

So are there any buildings on campus or individual restrooms that have fully closed stalls (not talking about the door reaching the ground, just a small to no gap between door and wall) ?

I live in a condo on west 21st street, and I got home from work today to find that someone had knocked over my motorcycle (presumably with a car) and left no insurance information. It was parked legally on the south curb of the street, and whoever knocked it over broke my right mirror, front brake lever, steering lock, and tweaked the handlebars, from the looks of it.

Some info:
-Bike is a Yellow Kawasaki which had a black cover on it at the time
-It was knocked over some time today between 10 am and 8 pm
-Whoever knocked it over knocked it over on it's right side, put it back up on the kickstand, possibly removed the cover to assess damage, put my broken mirror in between the handlebars, and then put the cover halfway back, and left no insurance info, so whoever did it could've potentially been there for a few minutes.
-The date this happened was Tuesday, September 26th, 2017

I'm reaching out to various online communities to see if there were perhaps any passersby who witnessed this happen.

If you were on west 21st street and saw this happen today, or have any information that could be useful in tracking the perpetrator down, please comment or send me a message.

Thanks in advance

But after college I had a very successful career, first as a software engineer and later as an entrepreneur. 

Now I’m back at UT studying economics just to satisfy my intellectual curiosity and, with just a few more classes to go, have a 4.0. It’s been a challenging, fun, and rewarding experience. So I’ve been there too. 

So if you’re struggling or feeling overwhelmed or lost and want to talk to somebody who’s been through that and come out the other side, just let me know. I’m happy to chat on the phone or meet for coffee on campus. Whatever you do, just don’t suffer through it alone.

i did well enough in high school — not overwhelmingly good, but i made it through and worked fairly hard. but here? i don't know what's stopping me from doing that. i don't understand why i'm such a lazy fuck, and i don't know what to do to fix it. my grades just keep going lower, and lower, and they feel so out of my control. i thought i could come to college and do just fine. maybe not 4.0 material, but at least a 3.0, maybe a 3.5 if i worked hard .... but here i am, about to fail the two classes that are the most important of all my classes. i have five classes, so theoretically, even if i were to make an A on the other three, i would still have barely a 2.0. and my science gpa would be shit.

everytime i get a bad grade, i feel like i get more depressed. and when i get more depressed, even if i tell myself i need to get my shit together, i don't do it. and then i hate myself for getting ANOTHER bad grade. how do i stop this? what do i do? i could get help, i could get counseling — but the problem is, it still won't fix my fuckups (and i don't have money or insurance, so that also sucks). 

so, my question is, does it get better? can i come back from failing two classes and still one day be successful, because my brain is telling me the exact opposite? does the depression get better? any tips for fixing my terrible work ethnic? i'll take all the advice and good words i can get ... because somehow strangers on the internet make me feel better than anyone else can.

Upon graduation, everyone will miss a huge tax credit and be forced to pay tax in full - even if you've just relocated across the country and set up your first apartment or home. (Relocation deduction is nixed too!)

Our senators are undoubtedly supporting this tax reform. That means that we have a chance in making a difference. Call, get an operator, ask to speak to someone in higher education policy, and tell them your story.

I’m a Frenchman that’s going to be attending the University of Texas Austin next year on a golf scholarship. I’ve never been to the US so I’m a bit nervous about my time in the University and the City.

1) I don’t speak English very fluently. Is that going to be a big problem?  
2) I hear Austin is very liberal, but what’s it like outside of Austin? 
3) I’m gay, should I come out or not?
4) Is there a sizable  European population  in Austin or any other cities in Texas?
5) Are Guns a réal problem? How much should a foreigner be worried?

I’m sorry if any of these questions offends anybody, I really am. I’ve heard contrasting things like Austin is very liberal and i won’t have a problem while I’m there but Texas as a whole is going to be tough for me to get used to.

The graduate student workers of the University of Texas at Austin will walk out of all work-related responsibilities on Wednesday December 6th, and gather at 12 pm at the South Mall for a demonstration.

How to participate:
1) Walk out of all work-related duties on Wednesday December 6th. Invite faculty to inform undergraduates of the situation by sharing the statement below during class time.
2) Protest at South Mall Dec 6, noon. Bring signs representing these three main points:
     a) UT runs on graduate student labor
     b) We already make less than a living wage, as low as $15,074/year
     c) The tax bill from the US House of Reps will tax tuition exemption as 
     income, diminishing the already inadequate system of grad-student 
     worker compensation, and destroying the grad student labor force.
3) Post pics of the protest and your grad student labor (including teaching, grading, etc.) on social media, using #gradstudentlabor
4) Follow @gradstudentlabor on instagram, where UT grad students will document the struggle of grad students across the nation

The purpose of the walk-out and demonstration is to bring attention to and protest two central issues:

1.     Graduate student-workers constitute the vast majority of teachers, tutors, mentors, graders, and researchers at the University of Texas at Austin. We are the core of educational labor, without which the university would collapse. This labor is currently both publically invisible and woefully undercompensated. Many graduate students do not make a living wage, and are forced to work additional jobs in order to cover the basic cost of living.
 
2.     The US House of Representatives has just passed a tax bill that will impose a federal tax upon graduate student tuition waivers as if they were income. If this version of the bill becomes law, graduate students’ already inadequate compensation will be severely diminished, making it impossible for all but the extremely wealthy to attend graduate school at all. Since graduate student-workers constitute the core of educational workers at UT Austin, this means that the tax bill threatens the existence of higher education as we know it. 

UT-Austin should use the occasion of this destructive federal tax bill to thoroughly review and overhaul the current system of graduate student-worker compensation to reflect the vital place of graduate student labor in the university, and to ensure that all graduate student workers are paid a living wage."

7kw108,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/7kw108/to_the_freshman_whos_struggling_academically/,To the freshman who's struggling (academically),75,17,2017-12-19 12:32:16,"Hi! I just wanted to offer some advice/my story to freshmen who are probably getting some of their grades by now. Please note that this is based on my personal life and I am aware that this is not a one size fits all post. I am also aware that while I did struggle through high anxiety and stress my first year of college, there are students going through difficulties (financial, mental, emotional, etc) that may not find this advice very helpful. 

Given that UT is a competitive school, I know from my own experience that being surrounded by hard working and intelligent people can be intimidating. What was especially hard for me (a former straight A high school student) was getting my first C- and Bs my first semester. 

I ended my first semester with a 2.7 GPA. I was devastated. I felt like I worked so hard and spent the majority of my time studying. Why did it seem like I was working 10x harder in college and still struggling? Now, I have a 3.7 GPA. 

Looking back at it now, here's some things that I did to improve my grades:

1) GPA is just a number.
Please remember this. Your GPA is a number. It shouldn't define yourself. Even though I set my goal to get a higher GPA, I did so knowing that at the end of the day, I was working as hard as I could. If you try your best and that doesn't reflect on your GPA, try not to get frustrated. I know so many intelligent and hardworking people that have low GPAs, despite how hard they work. I know people who are great test takers but don't think outside of the box. Tests don't always capture one's capabilities. 

While I realize this may not apply for students aiming to go to grad school after graduation (like pre-med), please note that employers really do not care much about your GPA. If you have experience in your field, you will be fine. 10 years down the road, you will probably not even remember your GPA 

2) Have a social life.
My biggest mistake freshman semester was not having fun. I always thought that spending time with my friends and going out was time that could be spent salvaging my grades. Don't think like this. The best thing I did for myself was letting myself take a break. I found myself more focused when studying. It also let go of a lot of stress and made my time at UT much more enjoyable. So yes, go out to those spontaneous Voodoo runs at 2 am with your friends.

3) Balancing academics, social life, and sleep.
I remember I used to see pictures on Facebook saying ""You can only have two: social life, high grades, or sleep."" This is so outrageously wrong. You can have all three, but it takes a hell of a long time to find the balance. Don't expect yourself to have the perfect balance your freshman, or even sophomore year. This was something I really struggled with when I started joining orgs, having internships, and maintaining a full class load. It sucks. But the older you get, you (hopefully) start to get the hang of things. Keep working on this balance and remind yourself that it's okay to let one of them slip once in awhile...we are all human :)

4) For the love of God, go to class and ACTIVELY listen.
When I was a freshman, I was great about going to class. However, I didn't actively listen during lectures. What I mean by actively listening is taking notes, not being on your phone, and not spacing out. Listen in class, even though it might be boring. It saves you a lot of time when you're studying.

5) GO TO OFFICE HOURS.
Yes, I know this is such a common advice tip. But I'm going to say it again. Go to office hours. Not only does it clear up any confusion you have, but your professor gets to know you. When you need references and letters of recommendations, these professors will be more than happy to help you out. I have gotten nearly all of my research positions, grade boosters, and recommendations from professors that knew me from office hours. Please go. 

6) Find the root of your problem.
My problem was that I hated going to class. I didn't enjoy the content, my job prospects, the workload, etc. So, I changed my major. Best decision of my life. Don't try to force something that isn't working for you. For me, it was mainly the fact that I did not like my major. 

7) Find a support system.
Whether it's your family or friends, find someone that is always there for you. They will help you when times are hard.

If you are not happy with your first semester, please know this: it is okay to do bad. What is important now is that you evaluate the issues you came across this semester and keep trying next semester. "

I basically do the labs alone while he sits on his phone or does absolutely nothing. Since we're partners, we both get the same grades on all the labs. Majority of the lab grades for us are A/high B, but last few we have actually gotten C on and I don't believe it's fair if I'm the one solely doing the work. I don't want to be a snitch, but labs really affect my grade in the class and obviously C's are bringing it down. When someone's lab partner is late/doesn't show up to lab, they get to work with another group and aren't forced to do lab alone. I feel this is similar because my partner is physically in class, but not mentally there lol so I basically work alone. 

Is it worth it to go and talk to my lab TAs before class is over (feel that they can vouch for me bc they're in lab and see me doing the work, asking them questions about lab, etc), or go straight to my professor? "

I was a little shocked, but I kept watching.  They tried to bring this guy back for maybe 10-15 min.  They left at some point after I stopped watching, but then some cops/investigators came back and started taking pictures of the body.

At first I assumed it was a homeless guy who overdosed, so I just kind of moved on.  But when they came back to start taking pictures, I'm worried it was a homicide.

Also, I just want to document this story because it's probably the most interesting thing that's ever happened to me next to meeting Reggie Fils-Aime at a gym in Washington.

I used to live very close to 29th and would regularly frequent the Subway near the Donut shop on Guad. One day though I went in and no one was at the counter.

I waited a bit hoping someone was just in the back or in the bathroom. But no one came.

So I called ""Hello"" a few times before deciding to call the manager's number on the door. I told him it seemed the store was unattended and that it would be fairly easy for it to be robbed. The chips were out, cookies out, drinks out etc. not to mention the register. (Though looks like Subways are currently getting robbed even if they are attended).

Manager asks me if I could stay there while he drives down, apologizing. I told him I would stay until he got there and let other customers know.

So I'm waiting and someone else comes in, thinking I'm the employee but I just tell him I'm a dude. So he starts looking around wondering the same thing I did. Cue another person. So 3 of us total. We start to wonder what's going on some more and one of them opens the back door into the kitchen area looking to see if anyone was hurt or unconscious.

At first we didn't see anything but then we spotted something move. A black man's head on the floor started shaking (all you could see was the head, but we assumed there was a body attached lol). Needless to say we lost our shit and though someone had either fallen or was having a seizure. So one guy immediately called 911 because the guy was not responding to our calls asking if he was ok.

Police arrive and ask if we're being robbed. First time I've ever had to put my hands up to a police officer. They go into the back and try to wake the guy up, he wakes up but seems very out of it. Police ask us to leave. 

I call the manager back to tell him what's going on and that the police were called. Probably not what he wanted to happen but understood that this may be a serious issue. Tells me he's thankful for the help, offers me free Subway at a different location, which was pretty dope, so me and one of the other guys go to the other Subway and get a nice sammich.

Next day Subway is not open, and the few days after that it looks like it's being taken down. So I don't know if this was the final straw or what but that Subway is gone as far as I recall. 

**tl;dr I went to subway, no one was there, find employee in the back passed out, probably on something. Got free Subway. Potentially a factor in that Subway being closed. Hope you had a fun time reading this! I wish I had proof but I don't think I took any pictures.**"

He posted confidential documents about the hearing on Facebook, and many commenters feel he deserves to be punished for his supposed lack of academic integrity. Of course, many of the reactions may have been motivated by students' inherent dislike for the individual due to his racist/sexist posts. Following the hearing, the student was placed on academic integrity probation, potentially harming his chances at graduate school. The use of past exams has always been called a gray area. Based on several reddit posts and comments on FB, it seems like the student body is split on the issue. If the use of past exams (not directly obtained from the professor) invokes the sanction of academic probation, at least 70% of the student body is guilty. In my major alone, there is not a student who hasn't accessed the online test-bank, which holds previous exams obtained from students who have completed the course. Additionally, the test bank is sponsored by a student org, in which several faculty members are advisors, who are obviously aware of this practice. Even if one personally believes that using past exams are unethical, how does one avoid staying behind the curve when 90% of your class uses them despite them not being handed by the professor. In addition, I have had several professors, who possibly reuse exams, not allow students to see graded exams outside of one-on-one meetings with the professor. What are your thoughts? Was the student simply a highly-disliked scapegoat for a common, albeit questionable, action? Do all students who have ever accessed past exams deserve the same fate?"

801h5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/801h5i/i_need_advice_desperately/,I Need Advice. Desperately.,41,20,2018-02-24 18:14:50,"Hello, Thank you for helping me by reading my mini-essay, I really truly am grateful for it.

 I was an ECE major at UT. I did 3 sem there and went through absolute hell. I went into the Major with the mindset of If I do this for 4 years then I'll have a stable Job and a high salary. I initially wanted to be a Neuroscience major and go into Medicine but I doubted my ability to be a competitive student. I had depression about halfway through high school which killed my work ethic but I still made out with good grades and a good rank. I went to UT, and from the get-go was thrown into a mental hell with terrible things happening all around me. I would go in every semester following saying ""this is going to be my semester"" but in the end falling into deep depressive episodes and dangerous thoughts. I did counseling and group therapy. Nothing really helped. My third semesters, I had a GPA of 1.8ish. I had completely lost control of myself and my mind and knew if I didn't make a change I was going down a very serious and dark path. 

So, Now I'm at home, taking general English, gov's classes at a local community college.  I got medication for my depression, and I do feel like I am getting better. I'm going to the Gym most days in the mornings with my classes in the afternoons. Since it was too late for me to apply to UTD (which is where I want to go). I did this. 

My plan now is to raise my GPA to about a 2.5. Do some light shadowing at a behavioral center, since I wanted to go into psychiatry or Neuro. I'm trying to take care of myself for the most part. But I'm worried if I'm setting myself up for failure. My father says if I don't get into UTD by this Fall, I have to go back to UT and get my degree no matter what. He says, he'll bring the family down there so that I can have the emotional support. He speaks sometimes like that's the only path. But that is the only ""known path"". Thinking of coming back to UT to do ECE, give me terror and puts knots in my stomach. I miss UT, I do. But as of now, going back seems terrifying. 

But the timeline of the whole thing is so complex. Will I get into UTD? if I talk about how I truly want to change paths, and not have self-pity for myself. With also talking about how I was very good in High School. I also had a free scholarship there, but I didn't take it. Its only been 2 years since high school ended for me, and part of me is mad that I have to prove myself to UTD. 
Prove myself constantly to my parents and those around me that I'm not just a child being dramatic but someone who actually went through something bad. But another part of me, says, they deserve an explanation and that you need to find the reason why. 

I have Asian Parents, specifically, my Dad who really loves me and has been surprisingly supportive because he believes I have what it takes to succeed. But still, worries so much and is constantly asking me why I could leave such a great golden opportunity. I don't blame him if this was my child I would be worried too. Most of the time I feel so so guilty since I've already racked about 9,000 in loans. And even more my Family's own Money. 


I don't really care about what my relatives say, or what the neighbors say, or anything. Not truly, but It bothers me a little especially when it impacts my dad. My father grew up poor and worked very very hard to get his degree and come to America and then survive here. And when he asks me, Why did you fail? And truly, I don't know why. It was a multitude of reasons separate from the academics. But if I tell him, I just wasn't attracted to the subject. He just doesn't understand, though he tries to - I think. I feel foolish saying that ""I'm not interested in it"". It makes me feel like some sort of stuck up privileged child. I feel so confused in my heart. 

I told him, I'm not like you Dad. Honest Answer - I didn't grow up like you, I was fortunate enough to have everything provided for me. And going into UT with the mindset of ""I'm doing this because I'll be stable"". wasn't enough of a desire to push me through. 

Many relatives tell him, ""How could she give up something like that? Of course, since her father provided everything for her, how can she have the desire to do well"" and "" If she can't do engineering school, how can she do medical? It's A lot harder than Engineering"".  They say my Dad is brave for being in this situation and that if this was them, they wouldn't be able to handle it. 

I know, I should be positive, because when you hit rock bottom, you have to be positive to rise. But I'm just worried what will happen to me. What if in five years, when I don't succeed and I'm living pay check to pay check, will I look back onto this moment and regret it? Will I think I am a stupid child who up something good? 

But then, everyone else tells me, you have to do what you love or you'll be miserable the rest of your life. And I wholeheartedly believe that now. I really don't want to come back to UT. Which kills me, because I was in love with UT since I was a small kid. I knew that's where I wanted to go by the age of 10. 

I have never been more confused, worried, guilty, terrified of my future in my life. I keep wishing I could get my work ethic back and kill this demon that makes me procrastinate or not care. I want my life to be better, I want to be better. I know I'm smart, I know I am. But nothing in my life lately has been able to prove that. 

I've applied to UTD before, but I didn't get in. I wrote about how bad my life was at UT and how I wanted a chance to prove myself again. I realize, that people don't care if you complain. That life will always have obstacles, but you just need to get over them and that I was just feeling self-pity for myself. I think it was a combination of self-pity and of bad situations. But no one will truly understand that. Maybe I'm just wallowing in my pain and drowning in 1inch water, meaning I don't really have troubles but am still drowning in them. 

I just don't know whats going to happen to me. Its like I'm blind and I'm walking a tightrope over a fiery abyss that 2 miles long. That's me- in community college - with my terrible work ethic - hoping that one day I'll become a doctor. Sometimes I think I'm absolutely crazy for even considering this, but other times I feel like ""This is what I want to do. so it's different.""

I just don't know who I am anymore. I used to do so well in school, and extracurriculars. I just don't know what going to happen to me. I don't know what happened to me to lead me to where I am today. For the first time, my feet are off the cobblestone steps going upward and onto the grass next to it. 

None of my friends are going through this, which is good. I don't want them to. I haven't met one person like me. 

I know that now is not the time to self-pity but I truly have never felt more lost in my life. I just feel the time ticking and I still don't have a conclusive answer. I wish I could just go to an amazing academic counselor who can understand all the massive details and give me a direction. For now, I am under my Dad's roof, where will I be five years? 10 years from now? 

Should I go down this risky path that I know only that it will be long but I only might succeed with a small chance? Or turn back around to pursue something that causes me stress. And somehow succeed. I know there are so many more jobs, and I shouldn't be narrow-minded but I don't know how to calm my father's nerves. I can't just be like ""I'm just gonna go with the flow, Dad"" and Hippie my way out of the situation. 

But in truth, I never understood how much my Dad loved me until these past few months, and I'm so lucky to have such supportive parents. But the Pain and stress I'm causing them are so painful for me.

I know there is a lot of information. I apologize, I tend to ramble and jump around with my thoughts. But If you can, please give me any thoughts and/or advice. I really need it now more than ever. Again, Thank you all so so much for reading my story.

I was rather disappointed about this, to say the least. My computer science teacher, on the other hand, was more than disappointed—she was irate. Her frustration wasn’t directed at me, I should mention, but instead at UTCS admissions, for denying what she saw as a perfectly qualified student. This eventually compelled her to email Dr. Calvin Lin, who she knows rather well, with a strongly-worded inquiry into my rejection. Lin responded respectfully, stating that he wasn’t part of the admissions council and therefore cannot speak on behalf of them, but he claimed that the 1360 SAT score they had on record for me might be one of the reasons why I was denied, as that’s rather below average for UTCS.

Here’s the thing, though: I never made a 1360 on the SAT. I made a 1450. My computer science teacher emailed back, informing Lin that I don’t have a 1360 SAT. Lin in-turn asked for my UT EID, which we gave him, and he verified that the student profile he was looking at was mine.

Lin was evidently as confused as we were, and suggested that I try appealing, but he casted doubts on how successful that might be. I submitted my appeal that night. This was February 1st, and I’m yet to hear a response.

A few days later, my computer science teacher told the school counselor about my situation, and my counselor decided to phone the UT admissions office directly and inquire into the situation. He asked for the SAT score they had on record for me, which they correctly identified as a 1450. 

Does anyone familiar with the admissions process have an idea as to what could be going on here? Do I have a legitimate reason to be upset, or am I just wasting the time of UT admissions officials by attempting to appeal?"

I see far too many students attempting to disparage, argue with or 'troll' the InfoWars 'reporters,' and all this does is give them footage of 'liberal college students' acting into their narrative of us being brainwashed sheep, or unable to hold a meaningful argument.

As some of you might know, a reporter from InfoWars came to UT's campus yesterday and spoke to students. Some students tried acting silly or arguing with them. Later that day, InfoWars published a video titled [""Liberal College Students Take On Infowars Reporter And Embarrass Themselves.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO-r3L6Z6a0)

Read the comments if you dare. That should be enough to tell you why, unfortunately, talking to InfoWars won't change anything. They'll cut and twist what you say to fit whatever narrative they want to construct about us.

The best thing to do when InfoWars comes to campus is to completely ignore them, and if they are actually on campus and not on Guadalupe, report them to the police to have them escorted away as they are not allowed to be on campus without university business."

It's a hidden meaning that goes back to one of the very oldest controversies on campus: the existence of B Hall, which was a men's dormitory and generally for poorer students who were sorta ascending, rather than elites who lived off campus. B Hall was one of the oldest great buildings on campus, and the old main building separated it from the women's dorm (which was where Flawn Academic Center is now).

A lot of people did not want a university of the first class to have rooms for men on campus. That's not first class. And that dorm's residents were behind a lot of stunts (and a lot of traditions).

Co-ed didn't just mean mixed sex dorms. It meant mixed sex classrooms. Garrison Hall was built very close to B-Hall soon after WWI, which was a major time in UT's history. This caused the elites to demand B-Hall be torn down. They said that female students in Garrison Hall would be able to see men's genitals, due to the racy guys in that dorm having no class. B-Hall was repurposed, emptied of its residents, and used for a variety of functions until after WWII, when it was torn down.

A lot of UT's most successful alumni had been residents of B-Hall, and loved its history and what it stood for: that anybody can work their way from a humble background to do great things. B-Hall, which was named for its anonymous benefactor, Brackenridge, was also a symbol of liberal (for the time) politics, vs George Littlefield, UT's other great benefactor.

UT has changed from the 1950s, and though campus's symbolism is largely a salute to Littlefield with many great buildings 'facing the south' and its recent confederate statues, Brackenridge's views have largely won the test of time.

And as a very very inside joke, nothing you're ever going to read about in any official document at the university, now the students in Garrison hall do get to see some balls with the statue on loan. A final prank from the residents of B-Hall.

Here are some tips from my job search,90,5,2018-05-30 13:28:18,"I spent the past semester trying to look for internships \(didn’t get it\). Now I’m looking for a part time temporary summer job so I can work full time \(I already have another part time job that continues in the Fall\) so I've spent lots of times looking around.  I’m a COLA major so I went in looking for a job thinking they all want Business and Engineering majors. I realized that there are actually **LOTS** of options for people w**ith different majors, skills and n**eeds so I want to share to those who are looking for a summer job or just in general. I hope it’ll be helpful

**TLDR: go in knowing what you want and your criteria then eliminate those that dont apply to you. there are jobs that will fit your skills and needs. dont give up too early and its okay to apply to several places.** 

*  **Do you want full time? Part time? Long term? Temporary/ seasonal job?** I only want a temporary job for the summer. At first I thought it’ll be hard to find cause lots of places don’t want to train someone that will leave. Guess what? **There are jobs that don’t need training and only need someone for a short period of time.** Don’t be discouraged and not search for it. **Try it!** Chances are you will find something that suits you.  I’ve found office assistant job, summer camp, cashier, retail jobs etc that only need someone for the summer. Put in different keyword, like “temporary”, ""temporary part time”,”short term” , “summer”, etc depending on your need. **Play around so you get more options**

* **What is your desired wage?** If you don’t care and just want to earn some money, then you have lots of options. My current job pays well so I want something similar. If I see something that’s lower than my range, I’ll pass on it so I don’t waste my and their time. **Know what you want**, usually cashier or retail jobs are closer to minimum wage, but assistant or office jobs can go up to $13\-$15. I found a job posting for a sitter for a UT staff’s 14 year old twins that pay $17 \(Hirealonghorn\) just to hang out, take them to activities, cook, and clean a bit!

* **What kind of jobs do you want?** Do you want to do labor work, at school or in office setting? Something more academic like research, analyzing, tutoring? Do you want to gain more professional experiences or just get a job to earn some cash on the side? Take this into consideration and **explore all the keyword and sites** so you can find all the available postings

* **Your schedule:** are you free all week? Only want to work weekday? Just 3 days a week? night shifts only? Use this and all the suggestions above to **eliminate job postings that don’t apply to you**. Some jobs will specify the day/time that they want so if it’s not what you want, move on. This will help narrow down your choices

* **Distance, location and transportation:**  If you have a car, this is great as lots of jobs ask for it.Some will reimburse you too if they need you to run errands.  If not, find ones near where you live. I’ve seen several postings with stores and offices near campus if you live on campus. Others are all over and outside of Austin so chances are you’ll find something near you if you don’t have a car

* **Know your skills and majors:** I’ve found babysitting and jobs at daycare that want Education, Child development major or just someone that likes kids and have babysitting experiences, pool jobs that only ask that you watch the pool \(pool attendant\), or know how to swim and they’ll train you in CPR,  jobs in bakery if you’re in Culinary major, accounting/marketing etc for Business major, office assistant that ask you to run errands, pick up the phones etc things that all of us can do,IT jobs, jobs in law firm if you’re a Law major, jobs in hospital, doctor clinic, in X\-ray if you’re Pre\-Med/Pharm major, tutor jobs \(esp if you’re good at Math, Physic etc\), jobs in drawing/designing, telecommunication, retails and grocery stores to learn customer service, deliver and pick up mails if you have a car, to something that’s random as moving chairs and tables out of a school for a month with $12 an hour if you like labor works or working out lol **there are things for everyone !** even if you only have a car, or if you speak Spanish, or you’re healthy and can do labor works, that already opens up several jobs for you so don’t be afraid to keep looking!

* **Exhaust all your resources!:** Linked is more for professional jobs while you can find all kind of things on Indeed and Glassdoor, Hirealonghorn is also good for jobs near campus or if UT staffs need someone to tutor or babysit their children \(you prob get a good recommendation letter if you do well\).  I don’t like Craiglist due to the format and so much spams but you can try. Keep looking and checking every other day. **Don’t give up if you don’t see anything you like. Keep looking**, I’ve seen jobs I want popping up after I am about to quit looking. You can set alerts too. Also, ask your friends, classmates and family members in case they know someone who’s hiring. You can casually bring it up in conversation too, you’ll never know if they know someone

  **LAST BUT NOT LEAST, READ THE POSTINGS CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU APPLY SO YOU DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME AND THE EMPLOYER’S TIME. ALSO, KNOWING IT WELL WILL HELP YOU IN APPLYING AND IN INTERVIEW DOWN THE LINE!** Make sure you have at least some of what they ask for and you can satisfy their requirements . I only want a 3 month summer job so if they ask for someone that can continue in the Fall, I don’t apply for it. If they have a summer job that’s full time and I only want part time, I’ll pass on it too. Just make sure you find what you want and apply to those. 

It doesn’t hurt to apply to several places either. You’ll never know until you get an offer. I used to think what if I apply to too many places, how can I decide if 2\-3 places offer me a job? Jokes on me, I didn’t get anything lol after that, I apply for several places and don’t say no to any place until I get an offer in my hand. Good luck and hang in there! I hope the formatting is fine and feel free to ask questions or add your own tips"

Alright so! At the end of spring 2017, I made the decision to not return for the fall 2017 semester. I ended the spring with a whopping 2.1 GPA, and a major I did not love one bit. I have always dealt with anxiety and depression so this further worsened my mental state. I truly was burned out and needed a break. I had been going to school for 12 years straight and never had a chance to really get to know the real world. I was in this “educational bubble” that I had taken for granted. Now, I just want to clear something up here, there are MANY people who are perfectly fine not taking a break from school. This is simply my own experience.

Anyways, the few people I told looked at me like I was crazy. They made me feel like I was throwing away my entire education and I would never come back. Was this true? Hell no. Did what they say affect me? Hell yes. But regardless, I continued on because I knew it was right for me. During these 7ish months I worked at a retail store full time. This taught me a lot of things but most importantly it showed me how much I took school for granted. I hated this job and I knew that if I didn’t go back to school it was going to be pretty hard to get a good job. Now, I do not believe that you need a degree to get a good job, but it is definitely harder to come across one without it (especially if you’re like me and have little to no experience in anything). 

Towards the end of 2017 I was starting to get excited because spring was right around the corner and I was finally coming back to UT and quitting my shitty job! I was so happy/nervous and ready to flip my grades around and kick ass! Which leads me to my next topic…

**Picking a major**
I thought about what major I wanted to change into for a long time. I beat myself up over this one because I felt hopeless. All my peers knew what they wanted to do and were so happy in their major except me (I later learned not to take this for face value because a lot of people are actually in the same boat). I truly didn’t think I was good enough for anything because nothing called out to me. And while I had 7 months to think long and hard about what I wanted to do when I came back in the spring, it actually wasn’t until about 2 weeks before the semester started that I actually had a huge breakthrough. ADVERTISING! After months and months of searching, I finally felt like I found my calling.

So here’s the thing, I took a huge risk with advertising and I don’t advise anyone to do what I did because it could have ended badly. Basically what I ended up doing a week before classes started Is changing my whole schedule and taking pretty much all advertising classes. Now for those who don’t know, you have to take 2 prereqs and actually apply to advertising. I pretty much said “fuck it” and signed up for both prereqs as well as 2 other advertising courses. Simply put, I put all my eggs in one basket. This could have EASILY backfired if A) I ended up not liking advertising or B) I didn’t get the required grades in the prereqs. Thinking back, this was not the most rational move but there was just something in me that knew it was going to be okay. So while I do hope you guys take more precaution than me, I also hope you know that gut feelings/taking risks may actually lead you somewhere good! I mean, that’s what life is about right? 

Fast forward to the end of the Spring semester and I ended up with straight A’s and just yesterday I was accepted into advertising. I’m not saying it was easy, but having a genuine interest really helped. The fact that I was excited to learn more about advertising led me to look at studying/doing homework not as a chore but as something fun (gasp!). It is absolutely crazy how much you change when you are involved in something you love. Honestly If there’s anything you should take away from my incredibly long post it's that you should pick a major you love so much that it doesn’t even feel like work or a burden. 

I know everything I said in this post is easier said than done, but please don’t let anyone tell you how to live your own life. I am far from conventional and there are times I wish I was just like everyone else but that’s not a good way to think. Be your own person and learn from your experiences. Who gives a shit what other people are doing and focus on yourself. You don’t always have to follow the herd to get to the watering hole (I just made this quote up right now please don’t laugh at me lol).

My job starts in late July. In the meantime, I'm taking every advantage of my remaining free weeks, traveling, going out with friends, spending time with my family, etc. But it's all been tough to enjoy when I think how bittersweet this summer is. I am off to a town of under 3000 people, over an hour away from any city considered remotely ""major,"" and where I'll be one of exactly two people at our facility under the age of 35.  
  
Reality is upon me, and it's plainly terrifying. I'm not good at meeting people. I'm not extroverted and trying to socialize is exhausting to the point I'm afraid I won't be able to handle it long enough to make friends. I've relied on school and existing friends to meet new people for literally as long as I can remember.  
  
I don't know why I'm posting this on here. Maybe some fellow recent grads are finding themselves with similar sentiments. I guess it would be comforting to know I'm not alone in being more scared at this point in my life than ever before. Or to hear if anyone went through a similar realization upon graduation, and had it work out better than they expected. I don't want to leave Austin. Austin and the people here are everything I know.

Questions like that are better off left to the pros, the advisers you meet during orientation and your upperclassman friends who understand your academic capabilities.

I worked in UT Admissions most of last year. I no longer work there, but I do keep up with my colleagues and other staff people I worked with. 

Recently I had an interesting conversation with a staff member that very recently left the Admissions team.

Long story short, admissions is in the middle of two serious events. 

1. Admissions is transitioning away from their current location in John Hargis Hall, and different teams are being moved to different locations on campus. The majority of the advising team will work out of the Visitor's Center, with other teams being moved to locations near the UT tower.

2. Over the past few months, some high profile staff have either moved onto other positions in UT, or have simply moved on from their role. Admissions has been trying to fill these roles, but if you know anything about UT hiring policies and procedures, then you know how slowly things move.

Admissions in UT is slow, cumbersome, and not very transparent. At this point, I would assume that the vast majority of Freshmen students are locked in. However, transfer students are all probably still in limbo.

If you call the general admissions line, the person on the other end of the line does not know when the decision date is. Admissions leadership directs phone counselors to simply state that decisions are coming ""soon."" An exact date will never be given. 

The phone counseling group are very dedicated and are a wealth of information most times, but when it comes to decision dates and reasoning behind decisions, they are very much uninformed. 

Good luck to everyone, and just hang in there."

8qvfxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/8qvfxg/a_guide_for_internally_transfering_into_mccombs/,A Guide For Internally Transfering Into McCombs,29,9,2018-06-13 12:49:27,"Internal transferring into McCombs is a difficult and vague process. I figured that after successfully transferring into McCombs myself, I could share what I've learned and maybe help those who were in the same position that I was 10 months back. Please note that this guide is geared towards internal transfers and not external transfers. Originally, this was a big wall of text, but I tried putting some of it in bullets to help with readability. 

&amp;nbsp;

## **I'll start out with my take on how McCombs chooses its internal applicants.**

* First and foremost is GPA. GPA is the number one thing that McCombs considers when reviewing applicants and this is no secret. Also widely known is that over the past few years, the ""minimum GPA' they look for has steadily risen and is now likely somewhere between a 3.85-3.9. While achieving a GPA of this magnitude may seem overwhelming, especially to those of you who are freshman, I can assure you that it is possible. I will go on to discuss how you can put yourself in the best possible position for achieving a high GPA shortly. Another thing that is widely known about applicant selection is that McCombs has recently become more holistic. In other words, they've added an essay prompt (in 2018) and areas for extracurriculars/awards to the application. While this is nice of them and important, don't let it deter you from the main requirement: a high GPA. However, if you are on the lower end of the GPA spectrum, the new ""holistic"" review will be beneficial. I've heard stories of people with 3.6s gaining admission in their sophomore year by writing an excellent essay and having business related extracurriculars. In order to take advantage of the process becoming more holistic, I recommend joining some business related orgs, doing some business extracurriculars, and writing a good essay.

&amp;nbsp;

**Here's some data I got from the BBA office that should give you a general idea on what kind of GPA is expected:**


Historical Admission Data | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017
---|---|----|----|----
Applications | 450| 452| 432| 450
Admitted | 261| 255| 221| 227
Average GPA for Admission| 3.8| 3.8 | 3.85| 3.9

&amp;nbsp;

## **So, how do you ensure you have a GPA above the average accepted? It comes down to three things:**

1. Carefully designing your schedule to that it is manageable and likely to result in a 3.9+ GPA.
2. Take any classes that can hurt your GPA outside of UT at a community college and transfer the credit.
3. Stay on top of your work, minimize error in your classes, and study consistently as the majority of your final grades cannot be below a 93 (it varies between different courses).

&amp;nbsp;

What I mean in the first point is that you should be taking 12 hours of ""easy A"" courses each semester leading up to your McCombs application. Also, try to apply as a freshman because even if you don't make it, you can apply again as a sophomore. It's much easier to hold a 3.9+ GPA for 2 semesters than it is for 4 semesters. Research your professors by checking the UT professor/class facebook group, searching the UT Reddit, and using various websites like ratemyprofessor.com and profpicker.com. Secondly, take a look at the syllabus for each course you plan to register for. You can often get a feel for the difficulty of a particular course by looking at its syllabus. You can find the syllabus of a class by using this tool provided by UT: https://utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/student/coursedocs/nlogon/. **If there's anything you take away from this guide, it should be the importance of creating the easiest schedule possible for your first year.**

&amp;nbsp;

## **Take classes that are known for damaging GPAs outside of UT.**

* By taking them outside of UT and transferring the credit back to UT, they do not affect your GPA. McCombs does not care if you take them outside either. Classes required for McCombs entrance that are known to be difficult include M408K/C (Calc 1), M408L/D (Calc 2), ECO 304K (Micro), and ECO 304L (Macro). This courses can easily be taken online at institutions like Hill College, Midland College, or in-person at ACC (Austin Community College). This is one of the biggest helping factors when trying to achieve a 3.9+ GPA at UT. You can use this tool, http://admissions.utexas.edu/apply/transfer-resources/ate, to see which community colleges throughout Texas offer equivalent courses to those I mentioned above. If the course is acknowledged as ""equivalent"", you can easily transfer the credit back to UT. While taking courses outside of UT is entirely necessary, it makes the process of getting into McCombs much easier.

* Almost everyone I know that was able to internally transfer into McCombs took classes outside of UT. Personally, I came to UT with AP credit for Macro and Micro, so I ended up only having to take Calc I and Calc II. I took Calc I over the winter-break semester at Hill College, and Calc II in the second spring semester at Hill College. Both courses were straightforward and with the help of my friends in Cockrell, I was able to make high grades in both of them.

&amp;nbsp;

## **Another important thing is beginning to work on your application as early as possible.**

* Think of it as one of the college applications you worked on in senior year of high school. You should try your best to perfect it. You can access the application at any point throughout the year if you have the prereqs for McCombs internal transfer completed. But if you're like me and didn't finish Calculus II until the end of the Spring semester, you can talk to an advisor in the BBA office (inside the McCombs building), explain your situation, and they will unlock the application for you.

&amp;nbsp;

## **A common question I've heard is ""do certain majors have an advantage when applying to McCombs?"".**

* While McCombs hasn't really revealed the answer to this (I tried asking at an internal transfer meeting which is offered in the months leading up to the application - I highly recommend attending one of them), I personally don't think current major will put someone at an advantage or disadvantage. I've heard some people say that UGS students are at an advantage (I was in UGS prior to McCombs) since they don't have a major yet but there isn't really a way to confirm this. However, certain majors are at a disadvantage in terms of course load. For example, those who are in Cockrell as a freshman are usually required to take more difficult courses than those in COLA and UGS (STEM courses), so they are seemingly at a disadvantage in terms of achieving a high GPA.

&amp;nbsp;

Having gone through this process myself, I know it can be tough. Spending 10 months worrying about not making any mistakes in all of your courses isn't easy. However, I can assure you it'll all have been worth it when you open up the email confirming your acceptance into the McCombs School of Business.

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR:** Pick easy A courses, Take courses that could hurt your GPA outside of UT, join business orgs and write a good essay."

And of course, the blanket provided was thin and nearly useless. I don't know how I would've held up without the one I brought from home. I wonder if it's why my roommate never sleeps in our room. I haven't seen her in this room in almost two days. She said she doesn't ditch curfew so I assume she sleeps with a friend somewhere else.

I'm only on this floor for orientation, so this rant is kinda pointless in relation to my future life here but venting is always nice. Also, maybe some insight for people who would live here.

I've been basically holed up in my dorm and I think it'd be really nice to meet some people. We don't have to be best friends! But something to do in my time would be great :)

So hello, I'm Terry, and I like to play Dungeons &amp; Dragons! I'd love to join a group and play throughout the year, but I've only played two games, which were homebrew with simple rules. If anyone wants to play, either a beginner like me or someone more experienced, that'd be awesome!

I like Glass Animals, Arctic Monkeys, Marina &amp; the Diamonds, and some others. I played the trumpet in high school too, so it'd be fun to be able to do that a little in college. 

I'm into nerd culture, like video games (though I'm not very good at them), I've been playing Breath of the Wild on the Switch and I recently finished Portal \^\^ Sometimes I watch anime and cosplay, but it's been a long time, and I'm an AET major too. I like to draw, so I'd be happy sitting at a coffee shop and doodling with people. I read fairly often, and I've got a small book collection in my dorm so I'll be happy to lend them. 

So, if anyone wants to do something, or we can go out as a group! Just something small, like grabbing lunch, or walking around, or even just chatting a little. Unfortunately I'm not very strong so I'd be little help moving someone in, sorry! But if you're interested please let me know. Have a good one!"

I've never exactly felt like I fit in perfectly with any group. I had a huge group of friends sophomore year, and for awhile I was totally happy with that, but now we've all sort of broken apart (we were a very diverse group of people and many of us found tighter ""cliques""), and some have graduated. Also, this past year I moved in with my serious boyfriend of 3 years, and I probably lost additional friends just due to spending a lot more time with him. 

Now I'm entering my last year, and I just want to find a tight-knit, genuine, laid-back group to chill with as I enjoy my final bit of time at this awesome university. I'm just at a loss as to what to do, though. I'm going to get more involved with my charity organization and hopefully score some cool friendships that way, but I know it'll take time to find what I'm looking for.

I guess I have this feeling like I grew up a lot faster than most of the people around me, and I'm at a point where I just want a sense of close community. I've made plenty of friends, but I never developed that sense of ""squad"" with anyone except my old group which has now dissolved into individuals who are mostly either very introverted, graduated, ultra busy, or have their own cliques that they don't really want to hang outside of. Aside from that, it's often felt like many of the people I got involved with either weren't good for me just due to simple conflicts of personality, or they weren't reliable/genuine.

I've tried groups based upon interests that I have, but it always felt like the individuals in those groups were so invested in that particular interest that I couldn't fit in completely. For example I tried a video gaming club awhile back, and while everyone was really cool there, it felt like they were all much more invested in gaming than I was (plus it was odd being one of the few chicks there). Same story with other orgs. I dipped my toes in the water for a spirit group, but I got the sense that few of the people there were actually genuine, and I didn't like the ""social games"" that I felt like I had to play to get in (I hope none of this sounds judgmental to spirit groups/sororities/the like - it just wasn't my cup of tea).

I think I'm just looking for unusually mature, reliable, genuine people with diverse interests (mine include gaming, art, fitness, outdoorsy stuff, and various intellectual pursuits). Does anyone have any tips, or maybe they can relate?

**TL;DR**

**Never built a sense of ""squad"" at UT, have tried various orgs and even had a large friend group but found it nearly impossible to find a tight-knit group of reliable and genuine people who I could relate with and open up to. Any advice, comments, or input is appreciated.**

I recently applied for an internship that has an option to submit an unofficial transcript. They even accept a screenshot so I looked it up to get mine cause why not, maybe it’ll help my application. 

Turns out UT charges $20 for unofficial transcript too?? And you cant even get it right away or order it online. You have to come in person to ask and I’m out of state right now. Plus, it’s only for a student with a financial bar. So a regular student who doesnt want to pay $20 for an official one still has to pay $20 for an unofficial one with the extra burden of coming in person :-)

Even in my smaller and less prestigious former university, we had the option to look at our transcript unofficially and can download a copy or screenshot, cause you know, it’s unofficial? So students should be able to get it right away and for free. Not at UT~ The internship deadline is tomorrow so I gave up on trying to get any record of my classes from UT. It’s a bit ridiculous tbh with the amount of tuition, we cant even screenshot an unofficial transcript lol

*If this happens to be the wrong area for a post like this I apologize in advance. 

I posted this on college confidential as well.

What's up peeps? I've posted in other threads, but I'd also appreciate any input you guys might have.

I see a plethora of people applying with less than 40 hours. In fact, it seems as though that's the norm, and most of these people tend to have a 3.6 or higher. I'm assuming those with the fewest university hours need to have as high gpa as possible. Then there's the issue of how competitive the major is the applicant is applying to. Just my observations.

Heres my dilemma: I have a university degree already w/minor. Jewish Studies/Minor Hebrew. I'm applying for Spring 2019 currently. I have 4 brilliant LOR'S, decent/good resume. I'm a non traditional student. I graduated with my degree in 2005. I transferred into my degree granting institution. My last 63 hours were a (4.0 gpa accumulative), was on the Presidents honour role each and every semester. Since graduation I took 6 hours at Loyola-Chicago 4.0 gpa.

Side bar: I transferred to my degree granting university from Saint Louis University. 3.49 gpa.

*I had one bad semester over 18 years ago. I had a death in my family and withdrew wrongly. Needless to say that awful semester has me scared about this process! I discussed briefly why this semesters grades occurred in a separate document I submitted through the mystatus upload. I hope this will suffice as far as explaining how a student like me did abysmal for that one semester. If this awful semester didn't exist my overall gpa would be a 3.7.

I've read UT Austin wants to see upward progress as far as gpa is concerned. I believe I've done that...but I'm still anxiety ridden about this process, especially after reading all the posts on this site and reddit. Anyway...what do you lot reckon? Do you think UT will give me a chance? I guess I should mention I'm attempting to go to medical school. I'm an AML Leukeamia survivor. I've been in remission since 2013. My fiance and I moved to Austin in order for me to do my medical school prereqs. Needless to say I'm all in! I desperately want to get these courses sorted at UT-AUSTIN.

Side bar: I applied, and got into Wash-U St. Louis prior to attending my degree granting uni. My point in sharing this is, a school like Wash-U accepted me prior to me getting a 4.0 gpa in 63 hours from my degree granting uni. 

Any advice or opinions will be massively appreciated. Cheers lads🍺.

PS: I've known loads of UT grads and many of them weren't that brilliant. There's no way every student walking the 40 acres is a 3.5 gpa or higher student. "

I recently completed my operating systems class last semester with a B+, and I was so proud of myself - I had consistently made Cs and Ds throughout my freshman and sophomore years, and I had to repeat CS 314. Last semester, I started off my junior year strong - OS was my only B, everything else was an A or A-. I now have a 3.3 cumulative GPA, when I had a 1.8 my first semester freshman year.

I also secured an internship - two, in fact! It’s admittedly not anywhere fancy like Google (it’s a small startup and IBM), but it’s still an internship, nonetheless. I was so proud of myself for the progress that I had made since freshman year!...

...Until I see what my computer science friends are up to both on LinkedIn and real life. One of my friends is an undergraduate teaching assistant as a sophomore and already has two internships under her belt - one at a startup after her senior year of high school, and one at Google after her freshman year. She’s a Turing Scholar and has a 4.0 GPA. Another is a Senior, and he has a sweet job lined up at DE Shaw after he graduates - he’s had internships at Bloomberg, Facebook, and worked part time at HomeAway throughout his junior and senior years. Oh - and he also founded his own e-commerce fashion site while in college and is (most likely) graduating with highest honors.

I then look up UT students on LinkedIn and it’s even worse! There are FRESHMAN who have the same level of experience as me. This one kid who’s a Turing Scholar and BHP student started a successful Wiki business, I think in high school. Another has SIX internships as a sophomore at fancy unicorns like Uber, AirBnb, and Lyft. Another has published 3 papers in math and theoretical computer science, a research internship at Stanford and UMich, and wants to apply to top CS PhD programs. And it seems like EVERY profile I click on has a computer science student that has an internship at Google/Facebook/Apple/Microsoft.

I feel so insecure about my achievements :( My “progress” and “accomplishments” of going from a 1.8 to 3.7 GPA last semester seem so pathetic in comparison to these students. I also had someone tell me the other day that I only got an internship at IBM because I’m a girl, and this just added another layer of insecurity to my abilities. Was I actually hired because of my merit, or because I’m a diversity quota?

Pricing is **one sticker for $3.09, 25% discount for 4 and 50% discount for 10** from the manufacturer. They'll be shipped by Redbubble (a print on demand service) which means that shipping is a flat ~$2 per order. While this is a bit steep, I'm not currently in a position to bulk order stickers and mail them off myself, so I figure it's a decent compromise.

Proceeds will go to Domino and Emancipet (thanks for the suggestion!). Go check out [Cats of West Campus](https://www.facebook.com/catsofwestcampus/) while you're at it, they do good things for lots of cats in the area, not just Domino.

Although he could not do anything (because the ticket had already been issued) he told us to follow up with the University to appeal. Pretty shitty because these losers got away with straight cash and did not get caught. Help spread the word so they either do get caught, and cannot do not do this again.

I also feel that my admission here is honestly a fluke. I also don't even like what I'm studying, and I feel like school is becoming more of a chore rather than enjoyment. I go to every single class, study regularly, and I still have been struggling to adjust to the classes here. Every time I walk past people happy here I shudder and feel unwelcomed knowing that I can't do that or have a valid interaction with people without making things awkward. I have no friends to fall back to and I feel like more of a burden to people when I ask for help. 

The thing that stresses me out the most is that I'm really trying to internally transfer into computational/aerospace engineering but I'm currently in my third year of college (used to be an engineering major at ACC, decided it wasn't for me, but now I want to pursue it again) so I've been regretting everything since coming here. My GPA is also probably too low (failed the first two exams in M 427L, so I can only get like a 3.43 in residence GPA at best assuming I can bounce back on the final). I've also been going crazy and secretly condemn myself and struggle to pick up hobbies. 

I want to transfer to a different university for engineering, but money is tight and I would be set far behind everyone else. I feel like I've ruined my whole college experience and shattered my dreams. One other option I could do is tailor the math degree, but it's just not the same as engineering.

I’m going to try to articulate my thoughts as accurately as possible here, but they’ve been a bit of a mess lately. I’m a high school senior who has 5 days left to decide where I will be going to college, and I have no idea which school to choose. I am deciding between the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Michigan. My ultimate career goal is to work for a professional sports franchise with front office operations. At UT, I will be entering as a business major in the McCombs School of Business, and eventually double majoring in Sport Management. On the other hand, at Michigan I would be going directly into Sport Management, which is in the School of Kinesiology. I’ll list my pros and cons of each school to give y’all a better idea of my thought process:

UT Austin: Pros

* Emotionally attached to UT, grew up a Longhorn (see username)
* Austin seems like a more vibrant city than Ann Arbor
* Much closer to family 
* Present support system at UT, I know a few upperclassmen who are like brothers to me
* Have already made connections with UT ‘23 classmates as until lately I was sure I would be going to UT

UT Austin: Cons

* Staying in familiar territory/comfort zone could limit growth
* Being close to family could be viewed as negative as they can be toxic at times
* Sport Management program appears to not be as strong
* May be a good thing to get away from high school acquaintances

Michigan: Pros

* Going directly into studying sport management better fits career goals
* Slightly more nationally recognized/prestigious
* Housing is nicer than UT 
* Smaller class sizes in Sport Management program allows for increased interaction with professors
* Sport Business Association leads to national and international connections (UT does not have a similar organization)

Michigan: Cons

* Would arrive knowing virtually nobody and no support system
* Cold winters would be a culture shock to me
* Michigan not as compatible with dual credit courses I’ve taken as UT is
* Significant chance I would have to live on North Campus freshman year, which would be a huge pain in the ass

Also, at this point in time finances are not a deciding factor. Probably should have prefaced with that. 

I would be infinitely grateful for any words of advice. Thank you!"

Which leads me to another point.  There’s an office each for USPS, UPS, and Fedex close to campus so you should not leave packages sitting outside a pickup box!  Anyone can grab those, and if it’s a box of textbooks then they can sell them for quick cash and you get nothing back.

Especially if you're trying to fill up your one pager. I'm an old UT grad (in my 40s) but I think this advice still applies. I wanted to post here because I know a bunch of y'all are about to graduate to the real world in May. My friends and I just had a conversation about how we got our first real jobs and this reminded me of my story and I wanted to pass it on.                        

So I struggled to get my first job - I had a good GPA on a Finance degree from the biz school before it was the McCombs school of Business.    I had one summer internship at Banc One Securites and other jobs in retail and hotels.                                                                   

But I had a rough time getting even getting an interview. Until I put a section on my resume for Personal Interests and listed I was the Captain of my HS Drill Team and on the UT Dance Team and additional charity work. That was enough of a lucky conversation starter to get one interviewer to basically not ask me about job skills and just wanted to talk about her drill team glory days. Long story short, I got hired.           

Getting a job is often about a connection. If you don't have connections, find a hobby that can help you relate. 

My advice is don't leave off of your resume what makes you special because someone might find it the reason to connect with you and hire you.

• You can check the grade distribution of any class, just google UT Catalyst grade distribution

• Check professors on RateMyProfessor (the phone app is the easiest way to do this)

• If a class has no professor on it, and it’s not online, it’s not gonna be a good professor

• You can save money and stress if you take hard core classes online at a community college rather than at UT. I am a business major, so I got to take Calc 2 and Macroeconomics online at Hill College and Navarro College during the summer, and saved a ton on tuition and time. Remember, you have to make sure these classes aren’t required by your major.

And lastly, remember, lots of people switch their majors. This is not something to freak out about, because we all go through it. What you need to remember most though, is that if what you want to switch to is OUTSIDE of the current school you’re in, you need a high GPA to transfer. That’s why I recommend taking the easiest classes you can for your freshman year, just in case you feel the need to switch. 

Take required classes with a high grade distribution, put off the hard ones for now, and start looking online to apply to these community college classes to save yourself. That in itself is a different process, and I can go into it if anyone would like to hear it."

\- First off, congratulations! You've probably worked hard throughout high school (and maybe college) to be admitted into this university! Some insight, this university is large, and its easy to know a lot of the programs and opportunities of how it works. Further, Austin itself is a rapidly growing metropolitan area that is in itself it's own beast. Here's some of the things that many, including myself, have grown to learn about the university. Note: This I'll try to updated this thread frequently in order to help out anyone new to this area.

&amp;#x200B;

**Classes:**

\- Every class that is going to be offered at UT is going to be found in the [course schedule page](https://registrar.utexas.edu/schedules). Most classes will have their room number, professor, meeting times, and registration status within this page. Make sure that you have [no bars](https://utdirect.utexas.edu/registrar/ris.WBX) and that you meet all the pre-requisites for registering into the class.

**""** ***What if my class is restricted, waitlisted, or closed? ""***

***Closed:*** Chances are, you won't get in it. Your only option is to wait until people have the opportunity to drop the class or the day that tuition is due (some people forget to make the payment and consequently get unregistered).

***Restricted:*** It's more than likely means that the non-major spots have been filled up or you need to have a special qualification to enroll into this class (Honors, ULN, FRI, majoring in ""X"", upper-division standing, etc.) Unless you meet these qualifications, you can't enroll in the class

**Waitlisted:** You have to *wait,* and that's about it. There's no way to skip to the front of the line, just see how many people are in front of you in your [""See My Waitlist""](https://utdirect.utexas.edu/registrar/waitlist/wl_see_my_waitlists.WBX) page. Rather than that, hopefully you'll get in but please do have a back-up plan in case the waitlist never reaches you.

&amp;#x200B;

**Registration:**

**-** Registering is stressful, especially at orientation. The best thing to do before registering is to make sure you have classes ready in a separate note document with their unique numbers. Also, don't count on your registration to be perfect, at least not your first one. Make sure to talk to your advisor, clear all your bars at registration, and have some schedules ready. Rather than that, here's some tools that can help you when registering.

[**""UT REGISTRATION PLUS""**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ut-registration-plus/hboadpjkoaieogjimneceaahlppnipaa?hl=en)

\- This is the tool you want. It has grade distribution, professor ratings, and a schedule planner all-in-one and works with the course schedule. Also, this Chrome extension was made by a UT student, make sure to check it out.

[**""UT PLANNER""**](https://utexas.collegescheduler.com/entry)

\- Pretty much self explanatory. You choose your courses, see which unique numbers work with each other, and plan out everything. I'll give this one kudos for having an option of alternative schedules, as opposed to one.

[**""UT CATALYST""**](http://utcatalyst.org/grade-distributions)

\- Shows grade distractions for an overall course and for specific professors. Has cumulative and term-specific options.

**""**[**RATEMYPROFESSOR""**](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/)

\- Let's you know how other students at UT feel about a specific professor. Make sure to pay attention to what term and course the rating is coming from as the rating for professors may vary. Although the ratings vary from person to person, don't solely pick a professor based on their rating.

[**""Registration Information Sheet""**](https://registrar.utexas.edu/students/registration/before/ris)

\- This is how you know at what time you're gonna register and if you have any bars.

**""**[**REGISTRATION PAGE**](https://registrar.utexas.edu/students/registration)**""**

\-Simple enough, this is where you'll register.

&amp;#x200B;

Feel free to add any more questions or things that should be mentioned. Will make sure to add about Microsoft Suite, UTMail, HBO, and other resources. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Freshmen please ask more things, people who've been attending, please include what should be added."

Just a little background, I’m entering my fourth year at UT and I am just about done with my B.S. in Corporate Communication from Moody (about 12 more hours), and I’m looking forward to knocking that out by Spring. And I internally transferred into McCombs last summer and have taken a decent number of business courses. I’ve always had some interest in finance but I haven’t taken 357 yet (taking it this fall) so I’m not sure if I’d really like it or not. I also really enjoyed ACC 311 and 312, and it was initially the reason why I applied in the first place. But to avoid making this post extremely long, I’m considering 3 options:

1. Only get a B.B.A in Accounting
2. Get a B.B.A in Finance
3. Accept and work towards the MPA

I’m getting my B.S in Corp comm regardless since I’ve poured so much time and money into that degree and I’m just about finished, but any advice from any MPA students/alumni and McCombs students in general would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks y’all! Hook Em’!"

Recently I got accepted as a transfer student into the Computer Science department at UT Austin. While this has always been everything I've ever wanted, it's getting overwhelming. I currently am a student at A&amp;M with a 4.0 GPA in the engineering (CS is in engineering at a&amp;m). So, I have a good thing kind of going. I am worried that with transferring, I will be so late to register, I will get all the terrible professors and struggle to make good grades. This is essentially the only thing really holding me back. How much of a discrepancy in professors are there? Also, I am classified as a sophomore through credit, however I don't have a few of the intro classes that freshman normally take. So i'm not behind but I will be late to some clases, meaning I'll take some junior classes my senior year for CS while my other friends will most likely take some chemistry or physics or something else they need. This is fine, but pretty much it seems for one semester or two I will be late to registering therefore get the unwanted professors. since my GPA doesnt transfer as well it will be fragile still, and so gettings Bs and Cs will take a big hit on it. Has anyone gone through this or anything similar? Is the name UT Austin worth it? Also just more info, I love austin and comp sci is 100% my passion, I've always wanted to be a longhorn so I was ecstatic to here I got accepted, I just didn't expect it to ever be a reality, so now I have a very difficult decision."

Yesterday morning, they told me I need to move out tomorrow, July 31st and that she is going to take over my entire lease and move in on the 18th. This doesn't make sense because no one would be living in that room for a month, I was *told* I could stay until the date I worked out , and I have no notice, place to live, or way to move everything out. 


They have nothing in writing anywhere saying this is okay and are threatening to charge $400 for every day past tomorrow at 12 that I stay. I was told *nothing* would even be processed until I paid a $250 fee for breaking my lease but that isn't the truth either.

Hey everyone,

My name is Andrew Young, a fellow student and CS major here at UT. I understand how f\*\*\*\*\*\* difficult subleasing can be. Most people use the Facebook group to buy or sell subleases, but its a terrible experience and falls short of solving the problem. I had an awful experience attempting to sublease my own apartment.

With Facebook, there is no way to filter or search for subleases, and often both the buyers and sellers just end up doing a lot of scrolling or messaging uninterested people. A LOT of time is wasted. I myself messaged dozens of people who didn't want to talk attempting to sublease my own apartment. So I built something to solve the problem.

I have made a [website](https://utsubleaser.firebaseapp.com/), currently only for UT students and those looking for a UT sublease, to post your apartment for subleasing. Posting your apartment takes less than a few minutes. Buyers can search, filter, and find the appropriate apartment for them. Messaging is done entirely through the platform, and everything is completely free for both parties.

This Facebook group is so successful because it is full of University students, and excludes all of the noise the other sublease platforms have. This is why I have designed the platform strictly for students.

Since this will eventually be expanded to other Universities across the nation (university subleasing is a common problem), you guys are the official alpha testers! Please feel free to message me if you see any problems, or just want to give me some feedback. I will be constantly improving the platform and iterating based on your experiences. Both the functionality as well as the design will be much better with your help. I don’t even have a name yet, so it is currently called “Subleaser”. The website has been tested against major flaws, and Google handles all security, so no need to worry about that. Although it may still crash, and there are many things that can be improved, so please email me at [andrewtateyoung@gmail.com](mailto:andrewtateyoung@gmail.com) if anything happens. *THE WEBSITE DOES NOT CURRENTLY WORK ON MOBILE!*

&amp;#x200B;

**The website can be found here:** [https://utsubleaser.firebaseapp.com/](https://utsubleaser.firebaseapp.com/)sublets

If you are offering a sublease, I highly recommend you post both on Facebook and on Subleaser to maximize your chances of finding a buyer. Since the platform is a baby, there is a good chance your apartment will be seen by more people. If you are looking for a sublease, some of the good deals may show up on Subleaser but I suggest you still check both platforms. Subleaser is better than any other solutions out there, but we will need a lot of people using it before it starts really starts helping you guys out. So come check it out! :)

*The end goal is to be the go-to platform for student housing.* I'll soon be adding a list of the common student housing options at your University in the “Apartments” tab. This is so you can compare them to one another and what other students think about them. Apartments.com and Zillow were WAY too disconnected from what students need when looking for apartments; there is a lot of noise and non-student apartments listed. I want to give people (And myself) a place to start looking and comparing options.

I have a few good friends but have never really found my ""squad"" as they call it and have absolutely zero dating/romantic relationship experience. I understand that a lot of people come to UT as freshmen or transfers and complain about not really finding their place, but most tend to figure out all of the things I mentioned above in a semester and definitely a year. For me, nothing has really ever worked out although I have found a few good friends. I am a bit of a socially awkward person(have improved greatly on this within the past few years) and really have social anxiety so I feel terrified of talking to new people a lot of the time. I was part of a friend group that I met at an organization over the past 2 months, but found out the other day they were being judgmental about me and talking behind my back, which of course got me even more down than I have before. A lot of the time, I realized it takes a tremendous amount of energy for me to get out of bed and go to class or an organization meeting. I always feel out of energy, unmotivated, and frustrated. Everyone has a good amount of friends, almost everyone has dated and have been in relationships except for me. I have wasted so many semesters and years here and it is really getting to me. I am getting a great education in Cockrell but my non-academic life is just a flop. Why can't I experience these things that so many other people at UT have been experiencing? I am 22, and have been at UT since January of 2016. That's such a long time for things to not fall into place, and I feel hopeless and am scared nothing will fall into place. Please DM me or comment if you would want to talk or even grab some lunch. It would be very much appreciated!

I meant to buy the Big Ticket and my TX/OU ticket a few days ago but I kept delaying it and... whoops, the priority deadline passed. A few questions:

1. Is it actually a free-for-all when it comes to seating? I heard some people say that basically anyone can sit wherever they want.

2. Since I'm a senior by credit hours (I hate myself for saying that), does that mean the tickets I buy will be basically just after they give out the priority seating? Should I still buy a ticket, or should I just try and buy one off of someone who bought already?

3. My friends and I all want to sit together, but some of them already bought and I haven't. I'm thinking about placing an order for the 3 of us that haven't bought yet, but any ideas on how to make sure that we can all be together?

UT is such a great opportunity but I don’t know what to do at this point.

It's not like my college experience was perfect, but if this can help anyone, then great. 


1) Don't be a dick. So like, 6-8 thousand of you shiny freshman will be entering UT next year, and *everyone* is freaked out, even if a little. That means you, the athlete, the sorority girl and the weird guy who wears his high school letter jacket in class. People may not really remember specific things you did, but they will remember how they felt when they talked to you. 

2) Dormcest is real. Think really carefully about hooking up with someone on your floor, because they're going to be your neighbor from now until *May*. 

3) Consent and Protection. Always ask for clear and affirmative consent - it is the right thing to do, and you don't want to be that kind of person who takes advantage of others. Wear a fucking condom, they're cheaper than a baby and less emotionally taxing than an STD. 

4) You're not at Harvard. Listen, good job getting into UT - it really is a world class institution and I'm sure you're going to love coming here - but you're not at Harvard, so stop talking down about people from other schools and *stop* talking down to people who didn't get in. 

5) Rush. Just sign up on the IFC Website, and if you really want to meet a specific fraternity/spirit group who hasn't reached out, go on the fraternities website and email their rush captain, or talk to someone in the fraternity or spirit group to get connected to someone who can help you out.

[www.scholarhuts.com](http://www.scholarhuts.com/)

Finding where to live and who to live with was always a shitty experience for us, so we built something to solve the problem. 

Just answer a few questions, and get shown housing options one by one to either like or dislike. When you like a place, you can message other students who also liked the place, or students who already live there.

If you aren’t looking for roommates, you can still find exactly what you and your friends need. Whether it’s an apartment, condo, or house, it should be pretty easy to find. 

Ratings from other students help guide you. (E.G, How noisy is this place compared to the average for UT Housing?) See the picture below for an example.

Even if you aren’t using us, feel free to leave ratings for any place you have lived, whether you loved it or hated it! Help us fellow students know what places are good, and which ones are not! We just need your UT email, so no sleazy apartment owners can leave a fake rating! :)

Not all housing is on here yet, there WILL be some bugs, and we are still very much in product development mode, so feedback is SUPER helpful. 

We won’t send you emails or anything, so don’t worry about that when using us!

That’s about it, happy hunting! Message me if you have any questions or feedback. Feedback can also be done through the website. Expect some changes in the product in the next few weeks, again we are super early, but just really want to solve this problem for all of you.

It's my first semester here as a transfer and I've been feeling like this place isn't really meant for me. Everything's slowly piling up and most of my time out of school is working almost 30 hours a week. I signed up for 12 hours thinking it'd be doable, but it turns out it's not. The only real reason I did it was because I reached the age where I could get some financial aid without parental help which didn't change much since I still had to bust out some extra money. I'm considered a non-traditional student which makes me one of the older people attending so it's a bit harder for me to make connections as well. I graduated from high school in 2012 and started community college in 2017.

I got into Computer Science and the beginner course hasn't been too friendly to me. I completely bombed the first exam. I had no real programming experience before coming here and I find my self spending way too much time trying to figure most of the problems out. It also doesn't help with the amount of time I spend away from school by working at my job which leads to cramming different topics at once. Some days I would just be too tired to get up and go to class because I was so mentally exhausted from work and studying for other classes the night before. I get discouraged when I overhear some kids talking about how easy it is since they probably had tons of knowledge prior to entering. Maybe CS is just not for me? 

I got into it wanting to expand my opportunities where I work so I can grow and be stable instead of being a simple store clerk. I spent about a year and a half at community college doing my basics where I had to start from the beginning with basic math courses and I feel like I just wasted all that time. I just feel like I'm lost and have no idea what to do at this point. I guess it's my fault too for not seeking help when I needed it. I couldn't really attend some external sessions also because it clashed with my schedule.

Reddit probably isn't the best place to ask for advice, but I'm not too good at handling these type of situations in front of people. I just find myself way too tired too often to be keeping up with the amount of school work I currently have. The thought of leaving and going to a university back at home has been lingering in my mind for the past two weeks. I just don't think I can keep up with it."

Was also extremely close with that person so that loss took a tremendous toll on me. I don't feel happy anymore. A few student orgs haven't worked out the best so far. I don't know how much longer I can keep going like this, I feel like all the happiness is drained out of me, I feel constantly drained of energy, and everything feels so different compared to a year ago. A lot of the times, I find it tremendously difficult to leave my apartment due to my lack of energy and unhappiness and this was never really an issue before. I'm the unhappiest I have ever been in a long time, and really want to turn things around.

One of the people in our group has the solutions manual since it apparently came with the online textbook. I know that having the solution manual probably isn’t allowed but I think it’s a valuable resource for trouble shooting    areas when you get stuck. In addition if I’m being realistic, if I have access to resources, there’s no reason why I shouldn’t utilize them as long as I’m not blatantly copying without understanding what’s going on. One of the group members copies almost word for word for a qualitative written response question and it’s been making me anxious. The TA’s use the EXACT same solutions manual for grading our homework. For the first round of homework,  the TA’s didn’t say anything but I’m not sure how to go about this moving forward. I’m stuck with this group for the rest of the semester and this particular group member doesn’t seem to understand what plagiarism means, even when confronted. I’m having a lot of anxiety since I’m worried that one person’s actions can screw the rest of us over. In addition, I want to have to constantly micromanage other people’s work but it seems like that’s the only option right now. What should I do?

I’m not very happy here. I spent a year of my life trying to get into McCombs and it’s not how I expected it to be. I feel like a lot of people are just trying to climb a ladder. Also, I hate the whole networking thing. I’ve only been here for two months, so hopefully things will get better. 


I’m commuting from home and the drive is anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. At my old school, I lived on campus. It took 5 minutes for me to get to my classes and the library. Now, at minimum, it probably takes me an hour to get from my house to the McCombs building or PCL. If I can figure out how to manage my time, commuting will save me so much money. My family is willing to help me get a dorm in west campus, but I don’t want to put that burden on them. 


At this point, I’m not sure if I can pass my classes. On my first round of midterms, I failed 2/3. On the one I didn’t fail, I got a 72. I took another midterm today, and I’m pretty sure I failed it. I have another exam next week worth 25% of my grade. I don’t have very much motivation to study for it, but if I can get it together I can probably pass the class. It’s not that my classes are impossible, I just can’t find enough time or motivation to stay on top of things. 


My mental health has hit a new low. I just want a week to sit back, collect my thoughts, and do nothing. I would really like to withdraw from the university or take a semester off. Also, I’ve been to CMHC, but I didn’t tell them that I’ve thought about killing myself. 


I am grateful for the opportunity to be in school. I like how UT has a lot of resources. If I can figure out how to manage my life, I think I should be able to get a decent job and have a decent life. Thank you for reading, again, any advice is appreciated!"

Firstly, we are paying to be here, so requiring attendance is silly. It should be rewarded, not required. Plus, the students who want to be successful will go to the class anyways. If you are sick or have a life emergency, it isn't fair to punish you for that. Plus, professors can talk too fast, we can miss something in our notes, or we just want something explained again.

I'm currently in a situation where a company is flying me out to Washington for a job interview next Friday. This was the only date offered. I happen to have a lab that Friday and the professor does not believe this is a valid excuse; she denied my request for a lab makeup any other day of that week. I'm still going to the interview because this is the field I want to be in and could potentially be the beginning of my career post-graduation in May. This is the reason I came to university to begin with, and this lab is not at all relevant to my field of study. Taking this risk means I'll get a zero for the quiz, the lab, and the report. I do not intend on arguing with the professor over this because I really do not care. My biggest regret is that other students might not be willing to take the same risks and could possibly lose out on opportunities that they might have otherwise obtained.

Some background. In high school I really liked my STEM classes. Especially the math ones. But I thought to myself, math by itself isn't super useful- I'll apply for CS! (Actually, I originally applied as EE but decided that was too low level and changed my application before the deadline). 

Now I have barely started 429H with Gheith and am not sure that I made the right decision. 

I really enjoyed some of the Data Structures projects. But even for my favorite ones I would get pretty stressed out when things weren't working out. Also staring at the computer for long periods of time for any reason is kinda draining for me. And I've learned from other activities at UT that I like interacting with / helping other people.

Maybe architecture has me overreacting because it is hard and tedious and low level. But maybe I should've applied to engineering. I like to build stuff. Maybe I should be pre-med. The underlying science is cool and I feel like I could actually make other people happy. 

I have no idea wtf I'm doing and it's really stressing me out. I'm pretty sure I can do just fine in CS, but I don't wanna live my life working in a field that doesn't actually make me happy. I feel like if it were actually going to make me happy, I wouldn't be having doubts right now.... 

Any advice?

For CS grads, what is your job actually like and what to you like / dislike about it?

The UT Austin community on Twitter is the most toxic community I've ever encountered. Basically, if you have a single opinion that goes against what everybody else on UT Twitter thinks, you're going to get harassed and ""cancelled"", and you're going to get a bunch of hate DMs. (for example, if you dislike any of a certain political candiate's policies, you're going to get flamed because you're not ""woke"" enough. This does not apply to people who endangered lives by irresponsibly going to Cabo in the middle of a pandemic. That deserves backlash.) UT Twitter's defining trait is that users want to seem ""woke"" by bashing/harassing anybody with an opinion that is slightly different from the mainstream political consciousness, but don't actually want to do anything to educate people on why they may be wrong or misguided. The problem with UT Twitter as a whole is that it **is more interested in feeling good about themselves having the ""right"" opinions and viewpoints than actually making change in society.** (Some UT Twitter users do great things, such as the new mutual aid fund for those struggling with COVID-19, which is awesome. Props to those students!) Surprise surprise, making angry tweets at somebody is **NOT activism**. And should you dare to think anything different, you get harassed, excommunicated, and voted off the island. They forget that there's a human being on the other side of the username. UT Twitter thrives on endless hive-mind drama and waiting for the next person to ""cancel"" and harass. Any Longhorns considering entering that community should rightfully reconsider. Longhorns deserve a community where they belong, and UT Twitter is not that community. It is a toxic cesspool of hive-mind and harassment, and it is a horrible representation of the UT Student body. Longhorns shouldn't harass each other. We should help each other become better people. Being in UT Twitter does nothing for you. Stay the hell away from it.

(If anybody in UT Twitter finds this, if you're angry that I'm pointing out the problems with your community, you're probably a part of the problem. Just saying.)"

I wanted to write down my story briefly for you longhorns; I hope you feel comfortable enough to share something as well. 

I come from a small town in Texas, and about only four of our class came to UT. I roomed for three years with one of my best friends, and came into college in a relationships with my then girlfriend. We broke up mid-way through the first semester and it absolutely crushed me. I spent a lot of time isolating, lamenting and being dejected. I was a pretty bad person and so I felt like it was punishment for me to suffer and not enjoy college. I spent most of my time my first two years just studying. I did not make many friends, and the ones I did make I did not keep up with. I played in a sports club but I only made two good friends (still good friends with both). However, most of my time was miserable - I put on weight, struggled with becoming a better person, felt like I didn't deserve much and just wanted to suffer a lot. It was the only sensation I felt really strongly. I didn't have any friends to confide in and just didn't feel like it was worth it. Although this never hurt my studies - I really enjoyed my classes and felt like my professors were the best people in my life. Additionally, I spent much time reflecting and keeping up a journal (which I still do), and reading books. These two things kept me afloat, and actually made me a better person.  

But I realized that holding grudges against myself was wasting so much energy - I was tired of being so sad on purpose and living a miserable life. I started to eat right, work out in the mornings, took up a part time job on campus, and started saying ""yes"" to life more often. Life didn't change magically change or get amazing - but it did get better. I made a few more friends, got nice internships, expanded my network, stayed healthy, got back into my numerous hobbies, went out more and just...lived life. I never did anything I didn't want to, or felt pressured to do something. I made many great memories, and I am thankful for my pain because it gave me wisdom and through that I grew. I am proud of what my four years meant to me, even though it wasn't the most ideal. All my friends have been supportive in their own capacities, and I have grown close to many professors. Everything isn't fine and dandy, but it is better. 

And now it has all come to an end. I really don't know what will happen with commencement. I really don't think it will go through if I am being honest. I am upset my parents won't get to fulfill their own dream of seeing their son graduate and walk. Or that I won't get to take pictures with my professors and friends at graduation. I plan on writing a letter to every professor, TA, and friend that inspired me and meant something to me. This isn't the end of things though. I will also be back here for my dual Master's program, so I am very thankful I don't have to part ways with Austin and UT yet. This isn't the way I imagined it, but that is okay. I have achieved so much, and I have so much to achieve.

It's all over now. And I'm kind of numb.

Graduation and the ceremony around it is so often one of the fondest memories people carry into adulthood. I feel like I'll never be able to relate to anyone from other years about that. For me, traditional college just kind of ended and was followed by a few months of slapdash online learning, with a compensatory cap and tassel to mark the occasion. Even though I already bought and have my own cap and gown to use in the ceremony that won't be happening. It doesn't feel great, and things like the cap and commencement livestream don't really do anything to make me feel better.

I dunno what my goal is with this post. I just want to put it out there, and want to know if any other seniors feel the same kind of way."

Just wanted to vent my feelings here to kids who I know can relate to me because they go to UT too(my other option is my 9th grade little brother who can’t relate to any of this). 

I went to Austin today for the first time since the quarantine started to move out, and seeing campus/WC as empty as it was, is literally... eerie and depressing. Makes me miss the times I’d walk onto 21st and immediately be slapped by the mob of people going to class. It’s a ghost town now. 

I’m really upset because I had a bunch of plans and goals for this year at UT. My freshman year REALLY didn’t pan out the way I wanted it to (got arrested, toxic relationship from HS that carried into college, some drug problems lol) and I found myself at the end of 2nd semester without very many friends, still feeling like I missed out on a lot of experiences this year. It feels worse knowing I won’t have an opportunity to have those experiences for another semester or two at least (fall is prob gonna get canceled). 

Idk. Thanks for coming to my ted talk. I know that looking at the situation from a negative perspective (like the one i shared above) isn’t really helping. I’ve instead tried to look at it as some valuable time spent with my family at home, and an opportunity to work on myself without feeling the rush/pressure of being in Austin (although i do miss that). If anyone else is feeling like this and has any tips on how to tackle this more positively, let me know.

A couple weeks in, I was taking &gt;!M427J and PHY303L!&lt;, and I could feel myself falling apart. I was studying harder than I ever had in my life. I felt like no matter how much I learned, there was still so much more that I didn't understand. To put it in perspective, I started studying 2 weeks before the test date and pulled 2 all nighters and still failed. *I wanted to drop out, I wanted to go home.*

One day, my TrIG advisor (a FIG but for transfers) gave us a presentation on UT's culture. He told us about the slogan, You Belong Here. I didn't think much about it at the time, but slowly as the day progressed, I kept seeing it appear *everywhere.* My email headers, posters on the wall, banners on speedway. **Everywhere.** By the end of the day I was on the verge of years. Say what you want about UT, but that slogan changed me. The more I read it, the more I felt like I truly am where I'm supposed to be. You know how people say fake it til you make it, I feel like this is similar. The more I said it in my mind, the more I believed it. I belong here, and so do you.

In a panel discussing the immediate future of University finances, Division of Housing and Food Service (DHFS) executive director Flem Hemmings stated that DHFS will be increasing the prices of all on-campus dining halls and convenience stores beginning in spring 20XX. Hemmings did not cite a reason for the price increase.

“I can charge whatever I damn well please,” replied Hemmings to a panel attendee who asked about the reason for the price increase. “Are you really going to go all the way to Guadalupe Street just to eat? Fuck no you’re not.”

“Maybe you fuckers shouldn’t have stolen all of our silverware,” added Hemmings.

Despite projected price increases, on-campus diners should not expect an improvement in food quality. Student employee Nate Johnson, who works at Jester City Limits, said in an interview that he is not aware of any major changes to the dining hall’s operations. Johnson expects that Jester City Limit’s menu, food products, and employee salaries will all remain the same.

“I’m so sick of it,” said Johnson of the food at Jester City Limits. “I don’t even use my free meals anymore.”

At press time, Parking and Transportation Services (PTS) director Billy Smith, who oversees on-campus vending machine operations, stated that PTS will look to DHFS as a model in its exploration of how to increase revenue from on-campus vending machines. ¨"

Like many of you, I did not 100% agree with all these claims and decided to do some thorough research into them myself. Be aware that many things I put in here are my own opinions, but I also make claims that I believe to be true and will back those up with direct sources. Note, all 8 listed demands are directly copied from the [UT Community Student on Equity and Inclusion](http://utsenate.squarespace.com/joint-statement-6102020) released by the UT Senate on June 9th, 2020.

&gt;**""1) divest from the Austin Police Department and the University of Texas Police Department""**

While in the same family of ideas, I will separate my discussion of the APD and UTPD divestment, as the UT Senate uses different sources and arguments for each. For the APD, their first argument reference several incident involving the APD and several black individuals who were shot, including Mike Ramos. All of their sources are valid and these are true stories, but it is worth noting that all the individuals except Mike Ramos were shot during protests this month. However this does not excuse it at all, and I agree this is a problem. Their other argument for the APD references a $430,685 grant that the Austin City Council accepted on 6/9/20. Here is a direct quote from the [source](https://austintexas.gov/council_meetings/action_notes.cfm?mid=785) they quote regarding this: 

&gt;""Approve a resolution authorizing the application for and acceptance of $430,685 in grant funding from the Texas Motor Vehicle Crime Prevention Authority to continue the Austin Police Department Auto Burglary and Theft Interdiction Project.""

Note they did not directly give money to the APD, but rather accepted money from a state-wide institution. I still believe police reform is needed, but it's important to understand the unsaid in this statement. 

They then move on to the UTPD for which this is the extent of their argument:

&gt; "" UTPD also remains complicit in upholding actions of white supremacy and failing to protect UT students against actors of violence, as seen in their repeated UTPD text alerts that racially profile men of color""

This is quite a bold claim, and it seems the two sources they reference don't exactly hold up. The first [source](https://rare.us/local/houston/alleged-white-supremecists-stake-out-the-university-of-texas-campus-only-to-be-left-with-no-climax/) is a story regarding a small white supremacist's protest on campus. According to this article:

&gt;""Police say they interrupted the demonstration before it began, asking the men to remove their masks and leave campus.""

And another quote from a UT spokesperson in this article backs up this claim. The Senate's other [source](https://twitter.com/porgemoji/status/1179063784092119040) is a twitter thread from a student containing screenshots of texts received from the UTPD regarding incidents around campus. Of these texts that do reference possible suspects in the crime, two are described as black and two are described as white. The thread itself says nothing about race, but rather the severity of the events. I believe their point might have been that a suspect that was identified as black turned out not to be the culprit. However, this does not constitute racial profiling as too much is unknown about the situation. While I agree about their sources about the APD, their claims regarding the UTPD are either not supported or, in fact, countered by their own sources. 

The last thing I'll note about their demand regarding the UTPD is their proposed alternative to safety on campus. They claim they want student safety achieved through other methods than UTPD policing. They propose UTPD funds be reallocated to:

&gt;""investments in mental health service providers, social workers, survivor advocates, food security resources (UT Outpost), housing displacement prevention, public health initiatives, and all other forms of nonviolent and community-led student safety methods.**""**

While these are all incredible things and may in fact deserve more funding, they provide little to no specifics on actually protecting the safety of students. They also emphasis the non-violent aspect of these methods. IN MY OPINION, I believe in some cases force is necessary to stopping crimes, as some criminals are not in their right mind, are not interested in reason, etc. 

Overall, I agree that the APD has used unneeded means of force that is racially charged. However, their claims about the UTPD are not supported by their sources and they don't provide comprehensive alternatives.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**""2) implement a test-optional undergraduate and graduate admissions policy""**

Don't worry, this will be a lot shorter than the last one. Basically, I agree with and fully support this idea. And all their sources line up with their claims. UT itself claimed and apologized for their initial decision for requiring standardized testing which was based on a desire to keep black students out of UT. The admissions department even acknowledges that as racial diversity went up, so did student academic performance. Also, they provide many sources for what I believe to be the truth, that standardized tests are inherently racists as their scores represent socioeconomic status more than they do any predictor of academic success. I recommend reading the articles they link if you are unsure, or this [source](http://www.nea.org/home/73288.htm) from the National Education Association. Overall, I completely agree this is a necessary, well-defined and doable demand.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**""3) incorporate land acknowledgments in all UT programming""**

Alright this is kind of a weird one. I'm kind of confused of how this fits in, besides being racial in nature, but that doesn't mean its a bad thing. I'm gonna be honest, I couldn't really find anything about if their claim that UT is on Indigenous territory is true or not. I suspect they may mean its on Indigenous territory just like how all of the US used to be Indigenous territory. The one source they quote is from an online journal from the UT Writing Center acknowledging the land as belonging to a number of Indigenous peoples. But that's it, that's their only source for this argument. Look, I think they have the right idea here about respecting and acknowledging this, but they make such a short argument and provide a single source to make such a bold demand as include land acknowledgements in ALL UT programming. I think the size of this request doesn't match the lackluster argument and this will be simply overlooked without much of a second thought. In my opinion, I think they would've had better luck asking for a smaller form of acknowledgment. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**""4) use a multi-faceted approach to incorporate conversations on race and systemic racism in the United States""**

Basically they ask for two things in this. 1. Inform more about UT's racist history in 360 Connections, campus tours at orientation and through a required module for incoming students. 2. Change the Cultural Diversity flag to ""address race, systemic racism, and oppression in the U.S. and incorporate these themes into core classes."" specifically for these groups of people: ""African Americans, Indigenous people in the United States, Asian Americans, and Latino/a Americans."". I'll address each request separately but I will note the sources in this section were references and didn't really contribute to the argument. However, this section doesn't really require outside sources as it relates directly to current things at the University.

Their first request about informing more makes sense, but an overdose may do more harm than good. They ask for a lot of time to do informing about history. But that's the thing, is that its history, and focusing on history takes away focus from the future. While I think it is important to know where UT started at, it should be looked at from a perspective of here are mistakes the university made, and this is how they and we are working to fix them for the future. I also believe celebration of the current diversity may serve some good as well. If all we do is focus on the racist history, it may just inspire hatred of the past rather than hope for the future.

Their second request involves changing the CD flag to focus on racism. For this request, I pull on my previous discussion about not just focusing on the past, but also celebrating the present and planning for the future. I think I have a different understanding of cultural diversity. While I believe race can be part of a culture difference, I believe other factors such as religion, nationality, socioeconomic status, etc. are sources of cultural diversity. That being said I also believe this is quite a bold request to make given the limited plan of action they give regarding what to do with current classes that offer this flag, who decides what fits their category, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**""5) rename Robert Lee Moore Hall, Painter Hall, Littlefield Hall, Littlefield Patio Cafe, Littlefield Fountain, Belo Center for New Media, James Hogg Auditorium, and remove the James Hogg Statue to stop honoring people who perpetuated racism on this campus""**

I actually agree with most of these claims and they have tons of valid sources to back them up. Renaming these buildings and removing a statue are not intangible requests, but are plain and simple. Especially the RLM has a lot of support to rename from students. The only one I'd consider taking a closer look at is the Belo Center for New Media. The argument they put forth is that Alfred Horatio Belo served in the Confederate Army and thus his legacy should not be honored. Their [source](https://web.archive.org/web/20080828193350/http://www.tnf.net/halloffame/belo07.htm) backs this claim up but it also notes the following:

&gt;""Belo was one of the founders of the Associated Press and a respected leader among publishers nationwide for his high ideals and commitment to unbiased news coverage, which was unusual at a time when most newspapers were aligned with a particular political view.""

Now this does not mean all is forgiven for his service in the Confederacy, but his reasoning behind his service is unknown and its impossible to known if he was remorseful for it. I'm not saying his building shouldn't be renamed, I'm just saying its worth taking another look at.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**""6) discontinue the use of “The Eyes of Texas” at all UT related events""**

The first thing I noticed looking at this section is how outgoing this request is followed by only a brief few sentences on the logic. However their argument is a strong and valid one. Their claim, well backed-up by this [source](https://abcnews.go.com/OnCampus/story?id=7160813&amp;page=1) from ABC news, is that the song was first performed by students in blackface. I believe this is 100% wrong and not ok. Now, the only thing worth noting in this article is that the purpose of the school song was

&gt;""Because the university did not have a school song, Johnson wanted Sinclair's help in writing one that would represent the students and faculty. ""

My point being that the purpose of the song wasn't racially charged. However, the initial performance of this song was completely racist. That being said, the Senate does a good job in providing a realistic plan of action to assemble a diverse group of student and faculty to compose and write a new school song. Now, do I think this will happen, I'm not so sure, but I do agree with and support the Senate in this case. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**""7) adopt equitable and inclusive practices in the recruitment, selection, and promotion of UT faculty""**

They basically use a lot of valid statistic here to point out the UT faculty representation is not up to par with other Texas colleges or the state as a whole. They also point out a plan released by the university in 2017, the [DIAP](https://diversity.utexas.edu/actionplan/) has not been very transparent with the student about its means to improve this. They also point out the DIAP has not kept up with its yearly progress updates, as seen [here](https://diversity.utexas.edu/actionplan/progress-updates/), as they promised. These are all strong claims and the Senate asks that the University follows through with the commitment they made. The only other interesting things in this demand is the last clause. Here is a direct quote from it:

&gt;""Furthermore, the University must increase funding for ethnic studies departments, and centers such as African and African Diaspora Studies, Mexican American Latino/a Studies, and Center for Asian American Studies. There is a clear student interest in the classes offered by these departments, and the University needs to ensure that these courses and majors are accessible to students.""

You'll notice nothing about faculty here. I'm not if they are trying to relate this to faculty in some way, didn't want to make a section just for this, or are just sneaking it in? I don't think there's any problem with increasing funding for these programs if there is a clear student interest and a need for funding. However, the Senate fails to provide sources for either of this claims, claims that in my opinion demand data to back them up.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**""8) institutionalize and fund a campus climate survey""**

I think this is a great idea by the Senate, a survey from the students about this kinds of issues would be perfect to reflect on the students actual wants. The Student Government can make all sorts of claims, but I think this [article](https://thedailytexan.com/2019/03/08/camron-goodman-amie-jean-named-student-body-president-vice-president-by-overwhelming) that states only about 13% of students actually voted in the student body president/vide-president election for 2019 and this [article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/college/2015/03/16/pranksters-run-for-u-of-texas-student-government-and-win/37401405/) showing student government elections being treated like a joke prove something. They prove that the student government is not a valid representation of the community of UT. That being said I think a student-wide survey is great. It'd be great for the university to hear from its entire student body, not just from a small, not well-represented, minority. 

&amp;#x200B;

All of this to say, take 15 minutes next Spring to take a look at the candidates for student government and pick someone you like and can support, or hey maybe run yourself."

As to be expected, the reality of UT and college in general varied greatly from such young hopes. Since the shift to online and being home all the time, I feel as if my expectations and desire to go to UT (or higher education in general) have changed quite a bit. I've been lucky to have a couple of really good professors and make a few good friends that made the experience survivable for my first semester but aside from their classes college hardly seems good or even decent. Since I've been offloaded into UGS I'm basically forced to take all of these ""basics"" that serve no purpose to me as I forget most of the class if not all immediately after (and sometimes before) it's over and done with. It would be fair to say the more I come to learn about UT the more I've been disillusioned and demotivated. The sad thing is that I've been programming in about a dozen programming languages for the last 5 years, probably 4 or 5 thousand hours at this point, and have done some pretty cool stuff just to be ""holistically"" told by the CNS admissions processes I wasn't their version of competitive. The move to online basically cemented this feeling as it got even harder to focus and have the will to drone through ridiculous exams and homework. Essentially, what I'm getting at is I've been disheartened and am curious to see if anyone else is going through anything similar.

TLDR; College seems to be overall sucky. Online made things worse, what do you think?"

**First and foremost** GPA is still important. You are going to want to have as high a GPA as possible. Think about it like this you need to still be academically qualified because you are applying for one of the top Business Schools in the country. For reference, I got in my second time applying to McCombs as an incoming junior with a 3.68 GPA. Keep in mind this year that multiple people with 4.0s got [rejected](https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/hccogg/mccombs_internal_transfer_acceptance/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf).

**Next,** I think the most important aspect of the application seems to be the essay portion and extracurriculars. I spent more than a month perfecting my essay, sending it to people, and making sure that it is one of the best essays that I have ever written. Ever since I got to UT I had always wanted to be in McCombs and I think it showed in my essay. For extracurriculars, I would recommend trying to get some leadership positions, and perhaps if you can participate in some Business orgs at UT that align with the business major you desire to apart of. Also, another bonus that helps is if you can secure an internship before you apply but this can be pretty difficult.

# Here are some important tips to keep in mind when applying 

**Tip #1:** Take Micro and Macro outside of UT. I took both here and I regretted it deeply. To this day those classes were some of the hardest classes I have ever taken at UT. For reference, I am one of the few people I know who transferred into McCombs who didn’t take Micro/Macro outside of UT. If you want to take it at UT just make sure you pick the best professor. For example, for ECO304K avoid Hickenbottom.

**Tip #2:** Try to take Calculus outside of UT as well. Keep in mind the business degree is changing this year and they are adding a Business calculus class for McCombs students so this might not be avoidable. I took both Calcs outside of UT at a local community college and it was fine. If you do have to take calculus at UT you will have to take the UTMA so I would definitely review your trig stuff before the exam.

**Tip #3:** If nothing changes, take MIS302F because it counts for MIS301 which is a notoriously difficult McCombs class. I would only advise against this if you were considering majoring/minoring in MIS then obviously MIS301 would be very important for laying the foundation for your desired business field. 

**(Tips 4 and 5 are very important)**

**Tip #4:** Don’t give up on your dreams. I didn’t get in the first time I applied but I spent my whole sophomore year grinding and it ended up working out. At the end of the day, the feeling of opening up your acceptance in June into the McCombs School of Business is probably one of the greatest feelings ever. I would honestly describe it like getting into UT all over again. 

**Tip #5:** Do not wait until the last minute to fill out your application! The essay system can be glitchy and it can randomly add % and stuff. Make sure you triple check your essay and make sure that all of it fits in the application system. Good luck!

Many times applicants have asked if sophomores who are applying get a last chance boost to their application and the staff have responded something along the lines ""officially no, there isn't an advantage for last-year applicants, but we do acknowledge it"".

Another thing is that you are not required to attend an internal transfer meeting but I would recommend doing so because you can get answers to many of your questions as well as see last year's admissions data.

A common question is when do admissions decisions get released and what does that look like. Basically last year in 2019 the decisions came out at around June 15 around 6 PM but this year decisions came out on June 19th around 6 PM. If you are accepted to McCombs you are given 3 options... (1. Replace your current major with Business, (2. Keep your current major and add Business as a second major. (3. Decline offer of admission."

My other option would be to fly from Dallas to Austin, which I believe would be a bit safer since it's only 1 hour vs 4 hours of exposure and the air would be filtered. Would the plane be packed? Neither of my options are particulraly safe, so I'm trying to minimize risk."

I’m graduating in Fall 2020. For the summer they gave me a subsidized load for 3k+. I used a portion of that money to pay for tuition in full and then $900+ went to my bank account as excess. Now, as the first session is nearly complete, UT is demanding me to pay back 1.3k+ as “financial aid adjustment” and they changed my loan. There’s now a subsidized worth less than before AND an unsubsidized loan that is worth a few dollars LESS than what I’m made to pay back for this “adjustment”. What the f is this about? 

They dropped this charge on a Friday night at 8pm on a holiday weekend. Their hours of operation close at 4pm. They have offered no explanation and told me to contact the office for further details (which I have). I imagine there’s laws stating they can adjust this at any time but it’s incredibly messed up. 

If I were to just pay this bs fee all my savings will be cleared that I’ve earned after using the excess finaid they gave me for school fees and expenses.

i've always loved reading, writing, and history so law was something i've wanted to do every since elementary school but somewhere along the way between elementary and high school, i lost confidence in myself. i didn't know if i can handle college coursework, i didn't know if i could make it into my ideal law schools, and i didn't know if i would even be good at law.

however, i realized that right now, it doesn't matter. i can't give up without even starting. maybe junior year me will look back and think ""yeah high school me was definitely right"" but for now, this is my new goal i'm working towards. i'm used to climbing this big mountains- when i was in middle school, i wanted to be older like those high school kids but once i got to high school, i faced new problems like applying to college. i'm finally on the other side so i'm going to use this as a fresh start and start climbing a new mountain.

Last week during an exam in the morning late last week ""proctored"" by Big Brother, Proctorio, my exam stopped and the screen read my exam was suspended. 

I had a clear desk, my smart watch off and far away, my phone on the couch ten feet away, nothing so much as a god damn paperclip within ten feet of me, and only papers on my desk ready to start the exam. We had to have plain scratch paper for the exam which I showed to the camera ahead of time. 

While moving papers beside me (like literally to the left of me slightly because I was going through my papers quickly) approximately 50 minutes into the 70 minute exam, the AI/person exited out of the exam and my lap top was locked with a screen saying my exam had been suspended. I literally had to restart my computer, in the middle of an exam, to exit out of proctorio since it prevents exiting full screen.

It took about six-seven minutes to get in contact with my TA via email for the class while hyperventilating wondering what the hell happened.

My TA told me to go back into canvas to restart the exam, and said he was able to give more time, but that ended up not being actually applied to my time limit and the counter was ten minutes less than it had been previously due to the interruption. When I managed to get back into my exam in Canvas fortunately all my answers were saved but I had lost about ten minutes and was completely thrown out of exam mode by sheer fucking terror. 

I was told I am not being penalized so I guess it was some sort of error? Is this what we are supposed to be totally cool with this semester?  Professors still using proctorio, are you comfortable with your students facing this in classes where each exam can make up up to 25% of our grade?"

I can’t remember the last time I’ve been this frustrated with a class. Tomorrow is November and we’re still having so many problems. Policies are changing, grades are changing, due dates are changing, we’re all feeling really insecure. 

When these things are brought up, the teaching team would say they’d talk about it, but it usually ends up with “we’re doing our best” “we’re not going to punish you for these problems” “we can always fix these things so don’t worry” and “we’re not going out of our way to make you upset” (paraphrased). 

Well, they say it to the point where I question if I’m the one that’s dumb. I keep failing these quizzes that supposedly are not that hard and everyone is doing great on. They’re not out to make it hard on us, so it’s probably my problem then. I really don’t know. Maybe I’m just stupid. Which is why I don’t know if I have the right to complain about this. But it’s kind of eating me up inside. 

Honestly, I don’t think anything has really changed. To their credit, they did try to take our opinions about things but some policies still don’t make any sense. The TAs cherry pick what to address and by this point, I’m just following along with my collar dragged."

Anyway, I lived in Texas with a full time job from Feb 2018 thru May 2019. During that time I leased an apartment and had utility bills under my name.

I moved back to Illinois and have been here since May 2019. 

If I get access to a utility bill and my old check stubs, do you think I may be able to claim residency in Texas for medical school?

Thank you"

What are the CS opportunities (co-ops, internships, undergraduate research, etc) that UT Austin has? What are the most popular CS student organizations and how many are there?

It’s been super nice to not have to worry about cloud storage.

If you didn’t realize you get free unlimited Google Drive storage with a utexas.edu email, well...you do! 

But, it’s going away in July 2022! It’s unclear what kind of storage or how much we will have, but it WILL NOT be unlimited. This is happening across the board for all Education plans, and it seems like having unlimited storage just won’t be possible on Google Drive anymore.

Here is an article about it: https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22284012/google-g-suite-education-workspace-meet-classroom-data-storage

Plus here is the actual post from Google about it: https://support.google.com/a/answer/10403871

If you have a ton of stuff on your Drive currently, I would recommend buying some hard drives and to start downloading. Better to do it as early as possible. 

I think UT Box has unlimited cloud storage for current students but I’m unsure about former students. It also has a max file size of 15 GB, or at least it did while I was in school. If anyone knows about any other options, feel free to let everyone know! It sucks this is happening, but it is completely outside of UT’s control, as it’s a decision made by Google."

It's super interesting; she talks about all of the different sources of generation and what happened to them; what did/didn't go wrong with ERCOT and whether Texas being more connected to the rest of the US grid would have helped things (spoiler: &gt;!ERCOT mostly did their job, interconnection wouldn't have really moved the needle in this situation, and there isn't anything easy and obvious to fix!&lt;). Anyways, I found it really insightful and a refreshing break from ""All wind turbines are evil"" along with ""this is all Greg Abbott's fault"".

So I was completely unaware of the housing situation at UT for a hot minute and didn’t submit my housing application until 4/21 😬 I’ve since then done some research and me and my parents are looking for off campus options in case I don’t get a dorm on campus. When would be an appropriate time to assume that I won’t be getting on campus housing and should sign up for off campus housing? Do housing contracts only come out until a certain date? Do I even have a chance of getting a dorm this late? 
I’m a freshman btw if that changed anything 
Thank you so much!!"

I was admitted to both schools for an undergrad in electrical engineering but I'm not sure which school to attend. I'd be paying similar out-of-state tuition for both. Here's a breakdown of the details that I've got for both schools:

**Georgia Tech:**

* Stronger ECE program
* Larger coop program
* Possibly larger study abroad program?
* More flexible in terms of switching majors
* Better reputation for tech and engineering
* Education is argued to be tougher or more rigorous
* Located in Atlanta which has many opportunities but fewer tech ones than Austin
   * Slightly more dangerous than Austin
   * Hot sometimes
* Less social due to its focus on engineering
* \~75% job placement rate for EE
* \~300 student orgs

**UT Austin:**

* Stronger school spirit/pride
* Notable engineering program but perhaps not as strong as GT
* A more rounded university (strong outside of engineering too)
* Large internship/coop program
* Large study abroad program
* Located in Austin, a booming tech hub
   * Better alumni connections within the city
   * Very hot sometimes
* Stronger school sports
* \~99% job placement rate for EE
* Difficult at times to register for some courses (not sure about GT)
* \~1100 student orgs

**For me, it really boils down to the fact that GT offers a more rigorous education while UT offers a better location (professionally and socially). What do you all think?**

**TLDR: Should I attend GT or UT for my undergrad in EE and why?**"

I love case western's academics and opportunities but I also love UT's community/opportunities. (btw i haven't toured case in person yet)

If I had gotten accepted into case's fall semester, this would've been an easier decision. I'm scared ill have a hard time making friends if I enter in the spring. I'm def a little shy so I'm worried entering in the spring would make it tough for me. going to UT would help me socially but if I finalize UT, I might be missing out on a great pre-med school

financially, i would be saving $50k at UT over the four years if i secure in-state tuition (my family is planning on moving there)

UT is a really big school so I'm worried ill have a lot of competition if i go there. also big class sizes and the pre med advising office isn't that great (from what I've heard). but, tons of research opportunities and clubs

however I've also heard that case is super rigorous so I'm worried i won't get a good gpa there. if i were to go simply based on med school matriculation rates I would choose case since 70% go to med school compared to UT's 50%. but I've also heard that the percentages could be skewed (any insight on this would be nice!)

I would really appreciate some advice on my situation. honestly, anything would help. I have to accept case's offer by May 14th so I'm stressed out. also my plan B is to go into the research field if the pre med track doesn't work out"

I’ve heard it’s generally acceptable to only have 1 Q drop on your transcript (more is a pattern). I want to save this Q drop for later but I think I might fail this class.

If you are posting here, you may not realize how useful your advisor is for your success.

I too entered with big ambition - I had sooo many questions about courses, minors, internal transfers, can I finish on time…. And I had a shit advisor who was just starting out. He got fired by UT during fall of my second year.  I never received any good advice so I stopped going to advising. Instead, I went online or to my friends for degree help. 

Don’t make my mistake. The people inside UT know all the tricks and tips for your degree. They can make magic happen - save a space in classes you need, call other departments, override requirements.. If your advisor isn’t helping, look for another advisor in your department. You can even message other staff, like the Dean of your college (though keep it appropriate; they are busy people!) , if you need extra help. They are approachable, nice, and ready to help you! If you are a UT student, I can guarantee just about any UT staff would help you. They did when I was advisor-less after mine got fired. 

Be aggressive, make a plan, and take the reins of your education. You are paying a lot for this and you should get exactly what you want out of it. A lot of your ambitious dreams are possible with proper planning, and reddit (or your friends - even if they are the same major!) isn’t always a good place for answers.

I’ve heard from so many people that UT is not the school to go to if you’re unsure on what to do.

For the longest time I was sure of getting the MBA 7gpu/16ram/256ssd, but I’m not sure how it would handle the things I’ll need it for.

I’ll be an incoming freshman studying MIS and will be doing some coding, research, essays, etc. So things like processing speed, multitasking capabilities, and battery life are important + I’d like for it to last at least the 4 years I’ll be in college.

What I’ll be using my MacBook for:
* Web browsing (preferably with Chrome even though it isn’t the most optimized)
* Using streaming services
* MS Office (PowerPoint, Excel, Word)
* Light video editing
* Using Windows 10 through Parallels (probably the most important) 

I’d only be willing to drop anywhere from $1.5-1.7k on it, since I’ll be buying an iPad Air as well. Any advice is appreciated, thanks."

My questions are: 

1. Can I start taking economics courses and liberal arts requirements now to get a headstart for when I switch majors, and to see if it is something I enjoy?  Can I also take prerequisites/bio courses for med school now?

2. Am I forced to take a certain number of hours for classes that are related to my current major, or can I take any class if I plan on switching to a different major? 

3. What is it like switching from the college of education to COLA? Is there an application process or will I just have to talk to my advisor?

I’m in a pretty complicated situation,2,11,2021-08-21 16:58:04,"Sorry guys this is very long but I need some reassurance

So originally I was supposed to move in on the 19th, but had to change the date to the 23rd bc I was scheduled to have my wisdom tooth taken out on the 19th. The 20th-22nd were full by the time I changed it. So I changed it to the 23rd (Monday). So the 19th comes, and the dentists tell me the surgeon can’t do it bc they’re out sick (for fucks sake). 

And since UT requires you  to have a covid test within 72 hrs, I had to test on the 20th, since I move in on the 23rd. Okay so here’s when I get confused

The 20th was a Friday, I tested at CVS (PCR). On their website it said PCR tests come out within 1-2 days. I’m not sure if these are just  days or if they’re business days. Bc if they’re business days they really won’t come out until maybe Tuesday. 

A little worried, I scheduled an antigen test (results in 2 hrs) at UT Austin Jester West on the 23rd at 4 PM (this is assuming the CVS results don’t come out in time). This was the only time available for the antigen test that day. This may have been a good idea anyway bc I’m pretty sure we are supposed to test again within 72 hours of starting class on the 25th. Problem is, I’m supposed to move in at this exact time (August 23rd, 4-5 PM). My move in time has been locked in place for some time so I couldn’t change it anymore. Since rapid results come out in 2hrs, I’ll expect to see it by 6PM that day. Will I be punished for moving in an hour or so late? Can’t call the staff rn bc it’s a weekend

Yeah my luck has been pretty fucked the past 2 weeks. I hope I’m not fucked"

Next, login to the big ticket website and pull up the ticket (on your phone). Once you get to the place where you would click “add to apple wallet” stop. On your mac open safari and go to the top where it says ""Develop"" in between bookmarks and window and you should see your phone. Hover on your phone and the link to Texas longhorn events etc that is on your phone will show up, click it. Then, the inspect web element window pops up, go to the network tab and click the trash can with an x on it to clear everything out just to make it easier to see (trash can is to the far right). Then, click add to wallet on your iPhone and a link saying mobile pass pops up your computer in the inspector window. Now, click where it says mobile pass and copy the long https in quotation marks.

Ive been living in Austin for about 3 years and been going to UT (took last semester off which would've ended my sophomore year so technically still a sophomore) and Ive dabbled in different courses and tried to find a major that suits me, but I genuinely have no interest in the majors Ive been pursuing.

I went to college because all my life its what my parents wanted me to do. All my hobbies and interests died in highschool (parents thought some of them werent ""practical"" enough to pursue and some of the things I enjoyed I was bad at so never tried to pursue as a career). 

One thing I do know is I like studying philosophy. I like studying psychology. I like my American Studies courses but Im not really sure thats what I want to make a career out of. I just want to help people, but not really deal with people (idk Im a pretty anxious person and Ive been trying super hard to get over it). Im just overall very lost and spending massive amounts of financial effort into UT when I have no clear plan and I dont know what to do.

If yall have any ideas of what I should pursue, that would be great tbh. I was thinking maybe counseling or education, but once again when I think long term, I dont think I want to do that. I guess its just hard for me to figure it out because I dont have a clue what I want to do in the long run. My parents and siblings and I have only ever worked in customer service and retail all our lives and I certainly DO NOT want to do that forever. But how can I escape that career path if I dont find it in myself to pursue some form of education that would give me the chance to do so?

Anyways, any and all feedback would be appreciated. Thanks for your time (take care of yourselves and have a lovely day)."

To that end, could anyone provide some insight on how they studied for the exams in this class? What resources did you use, how did you prepare when you got closer to the exam date, and any tips to be successful in this class? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I'm already feeling kind of down, especially because the people I studied with did spectacularly on this exam, so there's some silly comparisons I'm making in my head. I don't even really care about all that at this point, just needed some advice on how to improve.

But I’ve also been interested in mathematics, as I’ve always been great at that subject my entire school career.

Furthermore, it’s always different people but with the same MO. They all wear the same outfit and look like students. They all look like they’re in their upper 20’s or lower 30’s. Same pamphlet. Same “gifts” (crackers or cookies). 

I’ve also had this happen to me in multiple occasions in different locations. They’ve come to me in different floors of the PCL and even around midnight at the EER. 

Some are even a bit aggressive. Just a few minutes ago one lady of this group solicited me and whenever I had to respectfully say no (I’m hella poor) she left in a huff. On the 4th floor of the PCL mind you.

in 2 of my engineering courses, my professors struggled to finish all the content they wanted to cover for the semester. one went at lightning speed in a very important unit, and my brain was fried. I do feel bad because the professors also look rushed and stressed.

I also wanted to provide a few quick tips that I think might be helpful in writing an effective ""comment"" to go along with your ratings:

* Your instructor is your primary ""audience,"" so don't be afraid to address them directly.  Your primary goal should be helping them understand which aspects of the course had the greatest impact on *your* individual learning throughout the term.
* Specific constructive feedback, regardless of whether it is positive or negative, is far more useful than a general critique.  As an example, ""The dashes on the review packet were confusing"" doesn't provide much value to your instructor.  However, something like ""You used dashes instead of bullet points on the review packet, and on a couple of problems, I read the dashes as a negative (-) symbol by mistake"" is *super* valuable, because it directly addresses the issue.
* Comments unrelated to your learning (i.e. thoughts on an instructor’s appearance, personal insults, etc.) significantly devalue your response.  It is essential, both in preserving your credibility as an unbiased evaluator, and in protecting the excellent reputation of our student body, that you remain civil, professional, and on topic.

Thank you to all of you who complete your course evaluations.  You have no idea the positive impact you are making on your university.  Furthermore, thank you all again for another amazing semester here at UT and good luck on your finals!"

Could I get some thoughts from people who have studied abroad? Studying abroad is probably a once in a lifetime experience for me, but I’m not sure if it would be more worth it than interning somewhere and possibly opening the doors to new professional opportunities. I’d appreciate any thoughts!"
