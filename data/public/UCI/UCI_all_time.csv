5u53bn,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/5u53bn/a_manifesto_regarding_6b/,A manifesto regarding 6B,141,148,2017-02-14 19:29:17,"# I ALSO INVITE THOSE WHO ARE UNCOMFORTABLE POSTING THEIR OPINIONS/COMMENTS/QUESTIONS HERE FOR WHATEVER REASON TO PRIVATE MESSAGE ME. 

In regards to ICS 6B,

On the 6B midterm, one of the questions was regarding computing the ""binary matrix"" of a relation. The term ""binary matrix"" literally never appears in the 7th edition of the book. If it's mentioned in 9.3, they sure don't call it a ""binary matrix"" so how am I supposed to know that's what is referring to? Is it the one with 1 and 0 to represent relations? Assuming that's what it is, he didn't give us homework on that before the test and the homework he assigned doesn't cover that (iirc, not sure because the 6b page isn't loading for me right now). I'm honestly thinking about emailing him asking for another office hours so I can complain about this. I'm sick of Hayes who thinks he can put things on the midterm that he didn't cover yet and openly dismisses his students in class. I'm not I studied my ass off for the test and I couldn't competently answer some of the questions on the midterm because of their ambiguity. Furthermore, he's an ass to his students who seek help in his office hours. He told one student who was having trouble with a problem to ""stare at it for a few hours trying everything possible to get the answer"". How the hell does that help? I'm not sure if he thinks he's being funny or even helpful, but frankly it's neither and it makes him come across as a condescending, whiny professor who has to put down other students to feel better about himself and boost his ego.


I think the only reason he can get away with this is because people don't voice these things to him because he shuts down communication between himself and the students, presumably because he wants to remove any possible criticism of himself. It's not just his midterm that's the problem, it's his attitude in office hours which comes across at best as incompetent and, at worst, spiteful. The fact remains that his ability to teach the material is lacking. That's not to say he's a bad person, or that he doesn't know the material (In fact, I'm sure he's much more knowledgeable than most of his peers and I have no doubt that he's a genius), but the fact is that some people are better teachers than others and he just isn't a good teacher. I'm sure if Hayes reads this, he'll probably dismiss me as an idiot or as a whiny student. **Just know this: If a majority of the class is failing the midterm, it's a problem with the professor, not of the class.** I'm not saying that students aren't responsible for learning the material themselves, but the fact remains that even doing so these students were unable to complete the test. When a thread is submitted to this subreddit where every person is complaining about the test, there's an issue with the test. 

Sincerely,

A student in 6B

EDIT: I'm glad that Professor Hayes is entering into the discussion. That being said, I completely disagree with nearly everything he's stated so far. 

EDIT: People, invite others who are in the class to join this discussion. The more discussion we can get about this topic the better. 
 
# EDIT 3: I've received a message from a user who wishes to learn more about how the professor can make the final better. Here it is: https://goo.gl/forms/H7C3FEaCkqqsnmul1 I invite everybody to fill out this form. 

I like what this guy/girl has to say. Professor Hayes, if you're reading this, just something to consider:

&gt; I hope Professor Hayes doesn't take any of these comments out of context, since some might be seen as disrespectful or rude. With that being said, tese students pay a lot of money to go to this university and are all bringing up VERY valid concerns. Let's try to keep it as respectful as possible though (even if many are understandably very angry).
&gt; Professor: You should consider having a midterm re-take with a different test for those who want to take it again. It can be the same difficulty...but now that many know how your tests are, they know what to expect. ALSO, many students got slumped on the matrix questions which consequently slowed them down during the midterm by making them spend an exorbitant amount of time trying to figure out the matrix question, which ultimately could have resulted in many not getting other questions right that they otherwise might have gotten correct if the matrix questions didn't catch them off guard. Essentially, the matrices question easily could have had repercussions on many students that go BEYOND simply getting that question right or wrong. If you are a person who gets stressed on a test, it's hard to see an unexpected question and then just continue as if there is no problem. This is why a midterm re-take for students who are interested (of course with a different test), could be very beneficial and a great compromise, along with a lower curve and cut off for those who would be okay with their grade if those things came about. I feel some could have gotten A's but didn't because the matrices questions caught them off guard and thus messed up their focus on other questions as well - whether in the form of less time to finish (SINCE BARELY ANYONE LEFT THE MIDTERM EARLY), or a psychological impact that made them begin to overthink and everything in between during the midterm.
&gt; Thumbs up if you guys would think this is fair. 1: a more advantageous curve and cutoff for the midterm if you don't want to retake. 2: a midterm retake with the terms above for those who are interested.

So looking at the title, I guess it's a little misleading. Of course I'm happy that I got an A on my math midterm. 

But that A triggered me at the same time.

Why you may ask? Well it's because the professor I have for this class is absolutely amazing, he's the first professor that I've had that actually TEACHES. WOAH, AM I RIGHT?

He's the only professor I've ever had where I can go to a lecture and actually LEARN SOMETHING.

Last quarter, I had math 2D and bombed the midterm and final to somehow, someway, get a C in the class. The professor mumbled and made everything more confusing than it needed to be, and the test was filled with conceptual bullshit that we've never learned before.

However in my Math 3A class, there was nothing on the midterm that was unfamiliar. By simply going to every lecture and discussion, and doing the assigned homework, I was able to ace this test.

But in my math 2D class, I did the same preparation as my 3A class but studied 10 times more, and STILL got F's. 

I know the beginning of math 3A is a bit easier than the beginning of 2D, but still. The gap is huge, and what pisses me off is that I feel like college is just a game of getting the right professor.

It's so unfair. I know for a fact if I had a shitty professor for math 3A, I would've failed that midterm cuz everything in this class is so different than any other math class I've taken so far. 

Anyways, **TLDR**

The gap in good/bad professors here is insane and it pisses me off to no end. I just had to get my thoughts off somewhere and I guess reddit is a decent place.

I think we do a lot of things that we regret sometimes. I think the ICS 6B post is one of those things. The post was a product of my frustrations with the class, the professor, as well as with how college is structured in general, and at first this was simply a way for me to vent these frustrations. Little did I know that other people would jump on board and agree with me. Little by little, the post began getting upvotes. Then something unexpected happened. The professor emailed the entire class the thread, and suddenly all bets were off. Comments quickly turned into ad-hominem attacks (something which I admittedly took part in) towards the professor. The thread grew to a massive size, and even I couldn't imagine that it would turn out like this. That's the beauty of Reddit, you don't know what's going to happen to a thread. 

Unfortunately, I'm not sure the professor understands the point of this post. I just received an email stating that he's getting rid of binary matrix questions. **That's not the point**. On the surface it may seem like it's just about a few questions on the midterm, but it's much more than that. It's an issue with how you teach: playing ""stump the professor"" (which suggests you don't know the material, which is your job), insulting other students in office hours, covering far more amount of material in this class than other teachers who have taught 6B, not finishing problems that you've started in class, overemphasizing the importance of the class by making it seem like if I don't learn discrete math then lives are at risk . You said in your post that if I came to class, then I would've known the material. I've talked to multiple students through private messaging and whom I know personally, and they said that even going to every lecture and discussion the midterm was still unreasonable. They were able to do well on the midterm DESPITE your teaching, not BECAUSE of it.  I still haven't heard anything from professor Hayes that suggests he has addressed these concerns with the class. 

I'm glad that we were able to have this discussion, but in hindsight, I'm not sure if this was the best way to have it. In regards to revealing myself to the class, I don't think I can handle that extra stress. Just looking at the thread before I went to sleep @ 11pm, I began to get sick to my stomach and I wasn't able to sleep, and I'm pretty sure revealing myself would simply aggravate the situation more. I think the thread is enough, and the thread represents the frustrations that other students have with the class as well. Although I started the discussion, if it weren't for them this whole thing wouldn't have taken off. 

If anybody has questions for me they are more than welcome to private message me through here and I will answer as much as I can without revealing who I am. I've decided to leave the thread up for posterity, but I can't say that I condone what other students have said there, nor can I say that I say that I don't regret some of the things that I've said about Professor Hayes. I've ultimately decided that I will not be attending class today. I know, it's a cop out. But I'm already full of stress not only due to school but also personal reasons and after this shitstorm, I don't know if I can see Professor Hayes again, at least for this week. 

Sincerely,

A student in 6B

Even if I'm just a sophomore, I already freak out. A shit ton of my classmates already got internships in the summer. But I got nothing. Perhaps I am lazy about finding internships and procrastinate until the last minute. I always think oh I am sophomore I can just chill this year and find an intern in my junior year. But when I heard some of my classmates already got offers, I began to panic. I was born and raised in Asia, so I came to U.S. two years ago as int'l student. I feel U.S. is amazing and kinda wanna stay here, grab a job, and start my new life here. But it's hard to get a working visa or residence permit (like the green card), not to say the difficulty to be an U.S. citizen. So I have to get much higher scores than my peers to get an offer, otherwise firms wouldn't use me. I always compare myself with my peers, but the only advantage I have is higher GPA. I don't have extracurricular stuff, nor any competitions, nor any working or tutoring experience. Hence my resume really sucks, I even put upper div projects as part of my ""working experience"", not to say I don't have a cover letter up to now (but I'll make one by next week for sure). I always question myself, how am I gonna compete with others? I am lazy and don't wanna do shit. I am proud of my GPA, but that's it. Recently our major held a state-wide competition, though it was for upper-div background, but I panicked when I realized so many sophomores participated in that competition. I feel like I'm much left behind. I used to be proud of my GPA until recently I got invited to honor society. There were so many strong competitive opponents, my GPA isn't even competitive comparing with those people. Sometimes when I take courses, I ask my friends' scores just to make sure I am doing better than them. I am such an asshole that I hope people below me doing worse and bringing up the curve so that I could get a higher grade. My Asian parents care a lot about my academic performance, Asians care about ranking you know, and I know I must be competitive enough in order to stay in the U.S. My friend said there's still people below me, so I should relax. But I mean, dude, I come here aiming for the top, not even attempt to compare with the bottom and console myself that I'm fine.  I wanna achieve higher tier. There's no way stepping down and relax and chill. This is sink or swim. There's still some space to push myself to be a better student, but I dunno what specific strategies should I take. I wanna talk to people with similar situations and listen about your suggestions. If anyone can help plz PM me or comment your suggestions. Thanks for taking time read me shitposting. "

But here's the thing: Every year, the Commencement Committee (or whatever they're called) warns everyone to NOT create a market for commencement tickets. Do not buy/sell them. 

http://apps.vcsa.uci.edu/commencement/#/welcome

**Tickets for Commencement events are the property of the Regents of the University of California and the UC Irvine campus. They are complimentary and are not for sale or re-sale.**

**The Regents and the campus do not condone the buying or selling of tickets for graduation. Tickets can only be distributed at the discretion of the Regents and the UC Irvine campus.**

In the past, the University has posted that they'd take your personal tickets away. Consider that even if they don't expressly state it here. 

Here are the likely responses: 

**But they're my tickets! I can do what I want with them!**
Well, no. Not according to the contract/EULA you ""sign"". 

**What harm is done by buying/selling commencement tickets?**
By buying/selling, you're attributing a monetary value to the tickets which are EASILY counterfeited. When there's a profit motive and fraud is easy, you get people selling fake tickets which will result in your 12 aunts showing up and turned away for having fraudulent tickets OR your 12 aunts showing up with valid ticket and being turned away because the seats are filled with people who got fraudulent tickets. 

So please. Don't buy/sell tickets. Or *at the very least*, don't do it online where you can get caught and potentially punished."

So now that the final week is here, I suddenly got hit with this huge realization that the school year is coming to end. 

For some reason I did not think about school ending until now, I've just been so busy with school and other things lately that I lost track of time I suppose.

I am feeling sad because I got this great opportunity to make tons of life long friends by living in the freshman dorms, but I let it all pass. I mean I did make a few friends sure, and my roommate and I are super close now, but I don't have a like group of friends who I hang out with and tell secrets too and stuff like I did in high school, I just have my roommate and 1 other friend who I am really close with.

I just let time pass by, I had all of these great opportunities but I just let them go. I didn't even try to get a girl friend or make friends with a girl, despite being in a shared suite with girls. I'm remembering now that just a year ago, when I made the decision to dorm here, I was so excited to be able to make so many new friends and hopefully get a girl friend or make friends with girls. I've always been the introverted/shy type of person and I thought living in the dorms would change that, but nope, I ended up just staying in my room all the time doing homework like a total degenerate, just letting time pass. 

I am so angry at myself, why did time have to fly so fast? It felt like it was just yesterday that I walked into this dorm for the first time and now I am about to leave. How will I ever get an opportunity like this to live near girls and a bunch of other nice people, I'm just going to live in a single apartment next year, all alone by myself. Fuck. Why did I let this happen. 

I have tried joining clubs and what not, but I just haven't found a group of people who I click with yet. They're just all acquaintances. Well I mean if I can't even make friends with the people living right next to me how can I make friends with some people in a club. Damn it. 

I just wanted a place to rant a bit. I'll probably take this down soon, i don't know. Just feeling a bit sad that school is over, well it's complicated really. I'm fucking happy to be done with the torture of finals, but I'm sad that I let this freshman year go to waste. An absolute waste."

These are simply my own opinions and personal speculations based on current events.]

So I'm sure many of you have heard about the mass rescinding of countless students' admission offers. As an individual who is, more or less, in touch with the Office of Admissions, I'm here to explain the situation to the best of my understanding. (**I am NOT an admissions counselor**)

Basically we can say this started with the fact that the Fall 2017 class is over-enrolled by around 800 students (aka more people accepted their admission offers than the school anticipated). I'm putting the blame on this call to the school's administration - not exactly the admissions office - just because Chancellor Gilman and friends have been notorious for making decisions out of bad taste for the sake of profit (i.e. bye bye pub), in this case: more students = more $. I can easily say that whole ~~idea~~ disaster of the Anteater Leadership Academy stemmed from this over-enrollment issue and is the very same situation for this 'purge' now. 

In any case, the main reason why UCI rescinds students could be reasons including:

- Submitting requested transcripts/exams/documents past the indicated deadline
- Not maintain grades above a D/F and a GPA above a 3.0
- Falsifying grades or exam scores on your application (i.e. intentionally or unintentionally listing you received an A in AP Physics when you actually received a B or C)

This is how the office has been evaluating students after they SIR to UCI. However due to the over enrollment, I believe that the admission counselors have become increasingly stringent in the means in which they evaluate student files. This would mean, for example, that if the office of admissions did not receive your high school transcript by the designated deadline or received a failing grade in AP Calculus you will likely, if not already have been, rescinded by UCI. This was a big shift from last year's policy as the listed deadlines on the contract were essentially ""soft deadlines."" You could have submitted your transcript two weeks past the deadline and likely have not been rescinded; at most, you would have had an enrollment hold placed on your file until they received all your documents. Even receiving a D/F in a class was at times acceptable if you had a compelling explanation and it did not immediately end your chances of coming to Irvine. Edit: While Irvine has been flexible in the past, they still do deserve the right to rescind admissions if you in fact did violate your contract.

The most important (and frustrating) thing to address is that some students have been rescinded for none of these reasons. Some have claimed that they sent their transcripts way before the July 1st deadline (sometimes even in person), yet the admissions office system does not have it on file. Others have a completely clean file, with check marks across the board, and have been rescinded regardless AND without explanation. Staff will simply tell you to that it was due to a non-specific reason/violation of your contract and to submit an appeal. 

If you identify as one of these students, my best piece of advice is to review your contract and submit an appeal. Whether or not the admissions office, your own high school, or any factors beyond your control were the source for the error, the only truly formal way to address and potentially reverse this is through the appeal process. You can try your luck by walking into the admissions office but be prepared to most likely be disappointed and redirected to the appeal process anyways. But I can honestly say that if it was a clear error on the part of the Admissions Office, there is absolutely no reason why they wouldn't reverse the decision. Moving forward, I'm not so sure how this situation will pan out but this was likely a completely uncalled for result of the bureaucratic bullshit that happens behind UCI admin's closed doors. It really is unfortunate that it is the students are the one's suffering for this, while admissions can't provide a specific reason for each student. 

Things to consider/me also playing devil's advocate: 

- While this was a more prevalent issue this year, it should still be *your* responsibility to follow up with everything and not totally rely on the system to work for you. And unless you truly did not do anything wrong on your end, there were deadlines that had to have been met. A contract is still a contract and you are an adult. UCI's deadline policies are much less stringent compared to other UC's, I can tell you that.
- The permanent and student staff in the admissions office, I'm sure, are trying their best to help every individual who comes into the office. In my opinion, they're not the ones to get angry at. They're not actively trying to cut down the enrollment, as some student's claim. They're simply following the standards and policies that were relayed to them by their higher-ups and also relayed to the incoming students as well. If there was any body to direct complaints to, I would honestly say that it's the school's administration itself. 

Of course, feel free to DM me if you do have any questions.

1.) Avoid Alfaro for all classes.  I took her CS 141 class and it was a total disaster.  100% of our grade was based on tests and the class was super disorganized.  

2.) Get involved in organizations.  Use the involvement fair at the beginning of the quarter to find clubs to join.  I was a member of greek life and would highly recommend at least checking it out.  I never had the intentions of joining but after checking it out it totally changed my viewpoint on it and don't regret it at all.  Plus you can get free dinner pretty much the entire first 2 weeks of school lol. If that isn't your thing that is fine, UCI is a big commuter school so clubs are the best way to meet people and have a social life here.

3.) Talk to people in your classes.  You most likely will be going through tons of classes with people you meet in your first couple classes and building those relationships and connections help a lot in school and out of school.

4.)  Participate in hackathons.  Most my initial projects on my resume I used to land my first internship were hackathon projects.  Hackathons are amazing for networking but also getting some practical application of concepts you learn in school.

5.)  Find a stress relieving activity.  School and programming can be stressful and finding something to do for an hour or 2 to just clear your head helps so much.  For me it was surfing but for some people it is going to the gym, playing video games, or evening going to the pub on campus(highly recommend when you are of age).  

6.) Don't procrastinate.  The quarter system is so fast and it is really easy to get behind early.  It is easy to say because I've been there pulling all nighters on projects and I'm sure you all will be there too at some point but do your best to avoid situations like that.

7.)  Have fun.  College is a really unique time in your life so don't be afraid to put the books down for a night here and there and go have some fun.  

 If any of you have any thoughts about what I said feel free to add in the comments or PM me!  "

6py4yo,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/6py4yo/to_incoming_students/,To Incoming Students:,40,5,2017-07-27 11:56:49,"TL;DR: Get out of your comfort zone. Focus on school but don't forget to have fun as well.

I'm an engineering student so, understandably, I'm busy as fuck like everyday. I don't dive my nose into textbooks like most people (mainly because the reading isn't as intensive yet because I just finished my first year) but be prepared to STUDY YOUR ASS OFF. Now you're probably wondering ""An engineering student telling me to study? Why should I listen to him? He probably doesn't even know how to have fun.""

Well in that case, you're wrong. Let me tell you a bit about myself before I go any further. I was shy and awkward as fuck in high school. I barely had any friends (well I did but not like tight ass friends) and everyone knew me as that one awkward kid who wasn't that social. Whenever there was a dance, I would just sit down and pretend like I'm having a good time. Applying to college, UCI was the only school to accept me and I was nervous as fuck because I was an extremely sheltered child so I would be given independence for the first time. Now, when I went to UCI, everything fucking changed. I was a lot more social and could talk to people more easily. I go to parties like almost every weekend and instead of sitting down I dance my ass off. Now this isn't a post that's saying ""OMG SUCK MY DICK BECAUSE I PARTY HARDY."" Rather, what I'm trying to say is get out of your comfort zone and try new things, because from there I made so many friends and experiences that I want to relive my entire first year all over again.

As mentioned before, I was never that social. But in college, what I did was that if I thought someone was cool, I would tag them in memes and hit them up eventually to hang out. Lets be honest, this is fucking weird. Don't do this. Mainly because it's hit or miss and your meeting with them might be awkward. Because that's what happened with a few of them. BUT doing this I met one of my closest friends who is like a mentor to me and is honestly the reason why my first year was fun as fuck. Along with that, I also mentioned that before I used to sit down and never dance because I was too shy to. But when I started dancing at parties, I realized I fucking loved it. It really made me want to join a dance team, so that's what I mean by going out of your comfort zone. You don't have to go to parties to get out of it, but do things that are outside of the social norms; go up to someone and say whats up, be outgoing, be courageous, do things other people wouldn't because the moment you get out of your comfort zone is the minute your college experience will become a memorable one.

Now that's not to mention that you ALSO have to focus on schoolwork. Don't do what I did because going to parties every weekend meant I failed two of my classes last quarter (told you I wasn't showing off lol). In all honesty, if you want to make the quarter system your bitch, you need good ass time management skills and the ability to say no. When your friends want to turn up but you have a midterm the next day, don't be a dumbass like me and say yes because that's how I bombed it (thankfully the curve was in my favor but you won't always be this lucky). What I did to prevent this from happening is that I set up a schedule so I have set times to study and set times where I could go out. Hell, sometimes when I go out I study my ass off along the way. Whenever I know there's a long drive I grab a nightlight and my journal so I can read my notes. Basically, the short version is if you want to do good you have to manage your time wisely. 

Trust men when I say you can have fun and still excel in all your classes. College is what you make of it. Even though there will be those boring nights where you will be studying, there will also be those fun nights with your friends where you're out making experiences with them. Get out of your comfort zone, make those midterms into your bitches, and, most importantly, have fun!"

I guess since starting at UCI I had this image of what I was going to do or who I was going to be in college. I was going to join these clubs and possibly rush a frat and meet so many different people --  I wanted to be social and party like my outgoing friends and cousins.

And when SPOP passed and when fall quarter started, I realized I'm not the most social person. I didn't really make any friends at SPOP. I tried out a few clubs but then stopped showing up because I was beating myself up for not being able to make friends and not being outgoing. More quarters passed and I didn't really talk to people in my classes either. I'd try a few more clubs but then either get scared to attend or become disinterested. I felt lonely.

My second year came and I eventually pushed myself to try and going to a rush event. I realized then, after the event, that it wasn't just me being a shitty conversationalist, but that I have anxiety. My heart would race faster. I would avoid talking to people or at the last minute not show up to a club. I had so many unhelpful and discouraging thoughts about myself. I wanted to have a social group outside of high school friends. I wanted to have a support group and friends.

Eventually I thought about going to the counseling center, after seeing information about the center. After a few weeks of trying to get myself to actually sign up and speak to a therapist, I finally did so. So, after a few weeks and an entire quarter I've been feeling a lot better about myself. Not that the anxiety is entirely gone, but I think I'm way better at coping and have been practicing way more with interacting and socializing (through work and other things).

I'm an upcoming third year now and with 2 months left until the fall quarter I've just been thinking... I feel way more confident than previously. I've grown so much in the last two years and I'm actually really proud. But it's still really hard to not compare myself to others, especially around me at UCI -- where many are involved and have established groups. That I'm 2 years behind everyone my year in terms of knowing people.

I know I'm going to actually try more clubs and actually stick with them this time. But I'm also pretty terrified still about showing up alone, not knowing anyone, in attempts to meet new people. I hope everything works out and I continue to grow (past the social anxiety and hopefully to someone with more personality)

Thanks for reading!"

It's just insanely hard to register for classes to figure out what requirements meet what/ compatible times/ not totally waitlisted/ not driving hell for a commuter. Is it this much of a migrane every quarter or does it get better? Hah

Anyhow, the point of this post is just to say thank you and what a good community people who help each other out online is. I try myself to also contribute any knowledge that I have to to other people's posts on here because I know first hand what a nightmare transferring/scheduling can be. I actually spent more time this week trying to figure out my schedule than studying for TWO online courses *cries internally*

And the people at my advising session were so lost as to they didn't even know what AntPlanner was and were trying to figure things out with webreg... again, I wouldn't know about that if not for reddit so I was glad to provide some clarity for them in person

* **When you get the syllabus, put all the assignment due dates and test dates into your calendar or planner.** This way you won't be surprised when you find out your paper is due in a day. You can plan when to start studying or see if any assignment due dates or test dates overlap.

* **Don't procrastinate!** I'm sure you're tired of hearing this, but seriously... would you rather pull an all-nighter for that paper or write a couple paragraphs/pages every day and be done earlier? Who knows? You might have another assignment due or test on the same date. You'll wish you started earlier and wish you didn't have that much stress on your shoulders.

* **Use your resources!** There are office hours with your professor or teaching assistants. They are people and they have been in your shoes before, so don't be afraid to communicate with them. Most are incredibly nice, helpful, and fun to talk to. There are also LARC tutors or tutoring sessions hosted by the department. Go to them if you're struggling. Hell, you have classmates around you to study with or bounce ideas off of! Talk to them, make friends, and  study together. 

 *One little hack that I had success doing a few times was looking for previous courses' test material to study, either from the class websites (if they weren't blocked) or from someone who has taken the course already.* 

* **Don't have a bad GPA.** Having a high GPA isn't as important as it was in high school unless you want to go to graduate school. Otherwise, maintain a decent GPA and you'll be good. Just don't have a bad GPA and get put into academic probation or even worse, get kicked out of UCI. 

* **Plan your schedule** Some courses are only offered in specific quarters of the year. It's good to know when they will be available and plan to take them when you can because you don't want to be set back a whole year from one course. Also, know your prerequisites and make sure you have everything you need to keep moving forward. Now obviously, you're not planning it down to the tee, but having an understanding will prevent any surprises screwing you over. 

* **You're in college, enjoy yourself and have fun!** Each individual find enjoyment in different things and more often then not, there are others who enjoy the same things. So go out and meet people, make friends, join a club, join Greek life. Do what interests you, but it also helps to have an open mind to try new things and have new experiences. College is probably the biggest opportunity to meet people. 

* **It's never too early to have a job.** Sure you might miss out on some hang outs, but building your resume is definitely a good thing! And having the pocket money to use whenever you want doesn't hurt. 

* **Do something productive in the summer!** You get 3 months off...take advantage of all that time! Get a job or internship. Take summer school courses to get ahead of schedule. Or travel with your friends and explore everything this world has to offer.

* **Lastly, go to the ARC.** The ARC is just one example of something that is paid for in your tuition, so go use it! Take a class, start weightlifting, or just maintain your health. But if you're already paying for it, might as well use it right?

* **Make some friends who have cars** If you don't have a car, this is key. The reason I added this is because a lot of the best food and hang out spots aren't within walking distance from campus. With a car, you can get to the rest of Orange County, where all the good stuff is. Now, don't freeload rides off of them. Offer to pay for a meal or chip in for gas when you can and show that you appreciate them driving you around. 

* **Take care of yourself** This includes your personal hygiene...shower and deodorant ffs. Take care of your mental health. If you're feeling down, talk to someone. You're not alone in this world. Don't forget about your physical health. Eat some vegetables and fruits. Exercise, it doesn't have to be anything crazy, but get your heart moving when you can. And take care of your liver. It's important to have fun, but it's also important to know when to stop! 

With all that said, I hope at least one piece of advise was helpful. I wish you well in your future at UCI! Cheers!

Edit: Added a few more tips that popped in my head."

I only have 2 full days left, since I will be driving down with my family on Friday. 

I am stressing so hard about this leaving the only place I've ever known as home. I basically just wasted this whole Tuesday just stressing out over the fact that I may not have done everything I wanted to do this summer. 

Like right now I am just realizing, after going through some old stuff like old plans for the summer and what not, that I really wanted to make some songs, play a game that I've been wanting to play for a while but never got around to it, and so much more. I was actually perfectly content a week ago until today I was like ""oh shit, there's actually only like 2 days left until I leave!!"" and then I started going through some old stuff, got all nostalgic, and now I feel like I'm not satisfied with leaving.

Idk what to do. Need some advice :/

I mean I’m not excited at all to do homework again and stress about finals, but I guess since I barely have any friends who like to hang out a lot and stuff, I’ve just been sitting on my ass all summer and Ive gotten sick of it.

I’m sure I’ll regret just wasting this summer or taking it for granted in the future, but oh well. I fucked up, didn’t take advantage of the summer, and just sat on my ass instead of getting a job.

Anyways, I went a bit off topic (probably cuz it’s late rn and I’m super tired) but I really just want to know why the hell were starting so damn late this year. Didn’t we start on like the 18th or something last year? Christmas break has actually been cut a week short due to this long ass summer. I’m actually so mad about that.

A couple friends and I came up with an idea to start an open mic club on campus. It would be stand-up oriented but we would absolutely love other art forms such as slam poetry and music as well. I know that there are certain clubs on campus that do open mics, but ours would be different in that we'd host it weekly and it'd also be comedian-oriented (meaning there would be some wiggle room for performers in terms of political correctness.) I think it'd be a cool club where anteaters could get some stagetime to practice their material and people could come/watch/support and laugh at all the comics bombing. I know I'm going to definitely bomb. Any feedback on this idea would be appreciated, thanks.

6xhwxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/6xhwxk/warning_employment_scam/,Warning: Employment Scam,16,3,2017-09-01 15:18:22,"This information was sent out by the UCIPD earlier today:

Community Advisory: Employment Scam 

Over the past week, several UCI students have reported being contacted by individuals posing as hiring managers and soliciting students with job opportunities. These “job opportunities” often take the form of “personal or office assistants” and frequently ask students to purchase items or deposit checks. 

Most commonly, the scam artist instructs the student to deposit an issued check into their personal checking account while subsequently requesting the student to purchase items or send money to the scammer. After a few days, the student discovers the scammer's check bounces, leaving them liable for the funds they withdrew or transferred derived from the fraudulent check. The student is also being asked to provide personal information about themselves (address, Social Security number, bank information, etc.) that is eventually used for identity theft. 

Be cautious if the email or job posting... 
* Does not list a company name.
* Comes from an email address that doesn’t match the company name (most legitimate companies will use the company domain instead of a Hotmail, Yahoo, or Gmail account).
* Offers to pay a large amount of money for almost no work.
* Offers you a job without ever interacting with you or interviewing you.
* Asks you to pay an application fee.
* Wants you to transfer money from one account to another.
* Offers to send you a check before you do any work.
* Asks you to provide your credit card or bank account numbers.
* Asks for copies of personal documents.
* Says you must send payment by wire service or courier.
* Sends you an unexpectedly large check.

I have ICS 6B listed as a requirement for my major, and I heard all about how Professor Irani is the best for this class so I was pretty happy she was teaching it this fall quarter. At orientation I'm pretty sure she was the only professor planned for teaching it so I signed up for Lecture A.

Literally just checked WebReg today and out of the blue I now have a new professor for Lecture A while Irani now teaches Lecture B. I just checked RMP real quick for my new professor and she has horrible ratings...I hate to be shallow and judgemental of professors but after that giant ICS 6B manifesto I'm a little shook...ahaha -_-;; 

It seems that both professors will still teach for the discussion portion but does anyone know when this change occurred? And is ICS 6B a class that heavily relies on lecture more than discussion? Since I'm a new student, I don't really understand how lectures and discussions function at UCI. I'm planning on creating a study group that includes students from Lecture B too, since I'm thinking that may help a lot in case things may turn out for the worse.

Your grades do not define who you are. They do not determine your worth. Getting bad grades *sucks* and it feels like crap, but it doesn't mean you're not a good and worthwhile human being. College is hard. Some of us are bad at it. That doesn't make us worthless or useless or any of the bad things we tell ourselves sometimes on bad days.

It's okay that this hurts. You wouldn't be here if this didn't matter to you. Go ahead and feel that pain, but don't let it define you. Don't ever let it convince you that some imaginary brownie points in a system that we as humans 100% made up and still haven't really figured out how to run are a reflection of your value as a person. You failed at something and that *sucks,* but it doesn't make you a failure. The good thing about making mistakes is that you get to learn from them. Even if all you ever learn from this is that life always goes on, no matter what, that's a powerful lesson and one that will serve you well.

So what I gathered was that this guy either was latching on to the charm to try to get my back pack open as I was moving and it broke off from the force of me moving and him tugging or he legit just wanted to just steal the charm. Im going to assume the former more than the latter b/c who would  want to risk getting caught stealing for some charm? unless they get off on it or are some kind of weeb.(seeing how it was a video game related charm lmao). I didn't really get the best look at him but he was wearing this red backpack with darker red squares as a pattern or something like that, he looked pale, with short black hair, maybe 5'8 ish and a big nose. The worst part tbh is that no one said anything about it to me, it would have been so easy for anyone to have said anything to warn me or stop him in such a high traffic zone, but I guess the bystander effect works well.

does anyone have any motivational tips? i just feel like dropping out now tbf "

She used her phone lot throughout  the whole test. I clearly saw it with my own eyes, got a glimpse of her first name but not last. Didnt want it to appear I was looking at her paper. 

I mean,it sucks because I studied and worried about the test for a long time and it was a tough test, and she'll probably get an amazing Grade because she was able to use Google. Idk

These services are so important and I only have the utmost respect for those who work there. Although, I have a few gripes that I want to get off my chest. 

I've been going through a lot of personal issues lately which ultimately added up. I decided that I needed to get professional help. I called the first time yesterday and was immediately disconnected right after they picked up. Damn you shitty service provider! I called again, they picked up and asked for my ID #, you know, the works. There were pregnant pauses between the woman asking me questions and me answering. The pauses were so long that I repeatedly had to say hello because I thought she hung up. All the sudden she tells me she is putting me on hold then I get transferred to someone new. At this point I am getting annoyed. The new woman I am talking to is alright, she gets all my information down. Then she tells me that the earliest date for an intial appointment is the 29th of November. I was hoping for something earlier considering how much my school work is getting affected by my depression. Yes, I expected to wait a few days, but I didn't expect to have to wait until practically a month later to have my initial appointment. 

Considering how many students UCI has and the number of suicides that have accumulated over the years, you think they would try to expand counseling services.

Two of my roommates were gone for the night so it was just me and this one other girl. At 2/3 am, roommate brings back a guy. I’m half-asleep watching a movie, and I’m not thinking clearly. They say hi and I say hi back. I fall asleep.

Some time later, I wake up to hear them f*cking in the bunk bed above me and feel the whole bed slamming into the fcking wall. Now I feel super uncomfortable and awkward laying there thinking “should I tell them to stfu? I want to kill myself. I should’ve went home this weekend. Do I just pretend to sleep? Can I go back to sleep?” No one could’ve ever prepared me for this moment in college. 

Somehow I manage to go to sleep, and when I wake up, there’s condom wrappers on my bed and a transparent stain (I can guess what that is) on the side of my closet (which is adjacent to the bunk bed). Not only that but the stain dripped all the way down to my body pillow. And everyone is already gone.

From there til now, I haven’t seen my roommate, and it seems she’s avoiding me since it doesn’t look she came back at anytime of the day. 

I feel fcking traumatized and now as I lay here on my bed, I can still feel the bed moving and just realizing that actually happened to me is seriously giving me a hard time sleeping. 

I spent the whole day trying to think about what to say when I see my roommate. I don’t know if I should confront her and sound like a total b*tch (because that’s what I feel like right now) or to confront her calmly (which might or might not get the point across).

All i ever do is go to class during the day then go home. Thats fine for me, but i do get lonely here at times and i didnt take advantage of social events and clubs because i was too busy trying to catch up on my classes. Being alone here has also affected by academic performance because now im just trying to play catch up and pass my classes since i am struggling right now. What is your advice on meeting new people next quarter with similar interests you? This quarter im trying to focus on school, so next quarter my goal is to be more socially active and meet people who have similar tastes as me, while also having better time management. No, i do not want to join a frat. Nothing wrong with them, its just not my taste. Suggest anything because Im not gonna lie all i do during my free nights is play video games, study, netflix, or get high lol thanks for reading"

7glb19,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/7glb19/enjoy_the_norm_love_your_dorm_a_tale_from_across/,"Enjoy The Norm, Love Your Dorm - A Tale From Across Campus (Drive)",29,12,2017-11-30 01:57:52,"Are you sick of living in a crammed room? Are you tired of sharing everything with a bunch of equally disrespectful students? Do you hate your weird, awkward roommate who does nothing but sit in your room playing PUBG, swearing at other players half his age while eating jalapeno cup noodles? Well guess what bucko, you're living the high life! Now I know, everyone loves to hate on dorm life and I'm sure once you're out of there it will be nothing but handles, sandals, and bustin' a zot off the balcony of your pad just because you can. But trust me, despite the struggle of finding a time and place to give your meat a good ol' antbeatery, there's a fuckton of stuff to appreciate about your on-campus crib. Let me explain...  
I'd consider myself a very social and extroverted person. I love talking to people and I never ever thought I would have trouble finding friends in college... I am also dangerously stupid and missed the guaranteed housing deadline... And then they ran out of space. Fuck. So now I have an apartment across the street from Mesa, and it's nice too. Got my own room, kitchen, laundry, bong, it's cool as shit (for a freshie like me at least). But here's the thing, where the fuck you do meet all the other freshmen? Dining halls? Sure, I give it my best shot. Always sitting at the big tables, asking people their names, majors, whether they think a hot dog is a sandwich, and just generally complain about college shit. The good stuff. But alas, haven't gotten so much as a snapchat since week 2. Classes? ""Fuck off /u/askmeifilikewindmils I'm trying to hear Dellaca's math joke."" Clubs? Let's see, I'm bad at all sports, all my classes are between [3pm, 8pm]. Greek life? Missed rush week, too busy not making friends somewhere else. Maybe next quarter, I hear SigEp's bad at sports too. Now I know what you're thinking, ""Sounds like you're just making excuses not to work to make friends and just complaining about it to strangers online."" Well that's the thing, this isn't about me not having any friends leaving nothing but pizza rolls and Spongebob memes to distract me from the existential dread slowly creeping in, this is about how y'all can appreciate your dorm days. So many of the people I talk to complain about dorms and I tell them they're being a big sillyhead. While scrubs like me have to go protest net neutrality outside a Verizon store on a Saturday afternoon to meet people, all you gotta do is step outside your jalapeno-scented room and you're surrounded by a bunch of people who too are looking for someone to hang with. Just a few days ago I went to work on a project with my lab partner in one of the towers, and I was shocked that everyone got to go home to such a chill place with stuff to do and people to run into. We literally couldn't get through the hallway without multiple people saying hi to him and offering to hang later. If I leave my room the best I can hope for is my roommate is watching a tv show in my language and doesn't talk to me about his waifu. So next time you're feeling heated because the only option for a date with that cute girl from Cabrillo is sitting in your bunk watching Netflix on your 11"" laptop, and take this from the guy who's rich-ass roommate set up a 55"" TV with Bose surround sound, remember the part that really matters. Thanks for reading, I love you."

I am someone who have been through all that and I'm here to share with you my story. I won't go into too much details, but if you wish to know more you can message me. I hope this will help you. I got below 1.5 gpa in one quarter and I was subject to disqualification. I submitted an appeal letter but got denied. In the end, I was officially disqualified from UCI. I thought my future just ended and thought about killing myself until I found out I can get readmitted again. However, it doesn't get easier from here. To get readmitted, I had to be a full-time student for 3 quarters while taking major required classes from either a CC or UCI ACCESS. At that time, I already lost all my financial aid and I was too ashamed to ask my parents for help. To have enough money to pay for all my classes, I became homeless and worked a full-time job while attending classes at CC and UCI ACCESS at the same time. I ate the cheapest food and had no where to shower everyday for some time. I was sleeping in my car under the ARC parking structure. Every single day feels like a life time. There was not a day that went by without me thinking about how much of a failure I am and wondering if I'm ever going to get back into UCI. I had multiple breakdowns and was a few steps away from jumping off of a building at UCI. However, I stuck through it, and now I'm going to graduate next quarter. If your situation is similar to mine, I just want to say no matter what, don't think about giving up. There is always a way to fix this. It's not easy, but once you come out of this, you will be a way stronger person. And don't be ashamed to ask for help. Tell your parents and friends about your situation and they will understand. Once I confessed to my parents and friends, I felt a lot better because they would tell me they also had hardships in certain periods of their life. Everyone goes through tough time, but its those hard times that give life its flavor. "
7jtpn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/7jtpn3/youll_be_okay/,You'll be okay!!,90,16,2017-12-14 10:52:04,"Hello everyone,

I hope everyone is doing well at the end of their finals week! I just wanted to tell everyone that you'll be okay. There's been a lot of posts here about failing classes and possibly getting under 1.5 GPA and getting kicked out. A lot of the staff know that people don't adjust to university life well their first quarter, so they have plans to give you another chance.

If you get under a 1.5 GPA, you will likely be kicked out of whatever major you will be in and dropped to undeclared undecided. You will then go onto Subject To Dismissal (STDs are never a good thing). This is basically a contract saying you WILL get your shit together in ONE quarter, or else you get dropped. Likely, the staff talking to you WILL be assholes to you and ask you consider if further academics is right for you. Just ignore them and get the grades. If you get dropped from a major then start thinking of another one; I did not follow their proposed schedule because I thought it was stupid.

If you get under a 2.0 GPA, you will be put on academic probation. This means you have TWO quarter to get your shit together. They will probably also make you attend classes like note taking or whatever. If you have to take it, remember to go because they will give you ultra shit and it will breach your contract.

I think everything is still the same since my first quarter...

Just to share my story-- I came in as a first year as a biomed engineer, taking the recommended classes. First quarter I got a 1.48 GPA and got dropped from Engineering since its a breach in contract. I went to undeclared undecided, they told me to switch into other majors, and made me sign a contract and take seminar classes on being a better student. I forgot to go to one of the seminars and they were really mad but I found the lady and got her to sign off on the sheet. I then joined a major I love and am now a graduate student still at UCI.

My point is, this isn't the end!! If you want to truly stay then you will! But it will take time, effort, and sacrifice. Retaking classes does wonders since this is probably your first quarter; I retook Math 2A and got a B and my GPA jumped to a 2.5ish. Seek help if you need to. If you feel like shit all the time then make a trip to the counseling center (they're free). Talk to your academic counselors to see what you can do to stay. Also don't feel ashamed because a lot of people drop down to AP at least once because life happens. People also fail classes all the time and no one gives a shit. Anyone that starts judging you is probably an asshole. Take some time over the break to reevaluate what you want. Switching majors isnt a bad idea as UCI is trying to be more multi-disciplinary. You guys got this!!!!

EDIT: Please use the resources available if you need to! LARC, tutoring, TAs etc. I highly recommend the counseling center. I just finished  after multiple life events hit me at once. But something my counselor said was that people start to fail when they lose interest and become lazy-- this is often depression. so please take care of yourselves also!"
7lfltp,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/7lfltp/how_to_get_good_grades_in_cs/,How to Get Good Grades in CS,86,15,2017-12-21 22:11:12,"__Background for Credibility__  
I am a senior in CS, and transferred last year as a junior. I had a 3.974 GPA as of Spring 2017 and my Fall grades are turning out As. I took 16 units Fall 2017 and they were all upper undergrad CS classes. In each of my finals I scored a standard deviation or more above the average in classes of at least a hundred students apiece. I recently got a 100k full-time job from a major tech company to start this summer. If this isn't enough evidence that I may know what I'm talking about in CS, I don't know what is.  
__TL;DR I have a big dick and make money rain from the sky blah blah.__  

__Why do I Give a Fuck About Good Grades?__  
Because there is a positive correlation between academic performance and future career success. __Many of the questions asked in interviews are what you learn in classes, in ways that you won't expect.__ One technical interview that lead me to an internship was just asking me about stuff from 45C and 46. 
Another was asking me stuff from CS122A. You might think that people who are spending tens of thousands of dollars every year to go to college understand this, but you'd be surprised.

__Okay, You Got Some Tips?__  
Maybe you've heard these tips before, maybe you disagree with some. This is just what I think works.
[dk]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect  
1. __This is your job, and this is for you.__ Either you're paying to be here or taxpayers are paying for you to be here. Either way, someone is investing in you and banking on your success. You chose to be here. Not your parents, not your friends, nobody but you.  
2. __Assume you're an idiot, but you can learn.__ [Dunning-Kruger] [dk] means you probably know less about the subject than you think. If you already knew everything you would have the job you want or make your own company. Companies hire people for Engineer positions without degrees. You're here because you don't know shit, but you want to learn. Unless demonstrated otherwise, your professor knows more than you do, and when they recommend you go to lectures and discussions and read and do homework they're right. Don't assume you will understand everything the first time. Some of the stuff you will learn took geniuses of greater intelligence than you several months/years to find out; it will be hard to understand at first and you might spend hours beating your head trying to understand or going back and forth with classmates.
[evals]: https://eaterevals.eee.uci.edu/
3. __Most Professors Don't Suck, You Do__  
I presume you've heard horror stories about terrible professors that gave everyone a failing grade on the midterm or shit like that. The thing is, most CS professors at UCI know their stuff, know what you need to learn, and create exams that match what they teach. Maybe they're not good at lecturing but they provide ample studying resources and good homework. Maybe the other way around. Either way, it's your responsibility to maximize what you get out of the class. In the worst case, professors that are really abysmal at teaching get disciplined, and [you can see evaluations from past classes here] [evals]. When someone complains about how bad a class is, ask them why, what their grade is, what the class average is, what actions they have done to remedy. Some people just complain to deflect responsibility.
4. __Start Early, Be Friends with Future You__  
Do you have a habit of doing homework at the last minute? Have you pulled all-nighters? Have you been riding on a good grade for the final to pass harder than a pornstar on a dick? You should probably stop doing that. When homework is assigned do it as soon as possible. Everything takes longer than expected. Think like you have a priority queue of assignments sorted by due date and that queue needs to get empty ASAP. Set aside time for each class and commit to it. Some assignments just can't be  done in an hour or even a day because the fucking __execution time to test__ won't allow it (see CS143A, CS115, CS141, CS178, ICS46 etc.). When you decide to delay, ask __""can future me handle all this work?""__.  
[Timeboxing]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kI5FYpwZMXU
5. __Make a Routine__  
Routine &gt;&gt; planning. Routine &gt;&gt; organization. I'm not a person that makes detailed Excel spreadsheets about every little thing I'm going to do. I'm not a machine impervious to procrastination or distraction. I just set aside time every week for each class, and commit to it. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kI5FYpwZMXU] [Timeboxing]
[notes]: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-learning-secret-don-t-take-notes-with-a-laptop/
6. __Make a Study Guide/Cheatsheet, Even If Not Allowed__  
Making a study guide can be a great way to structure your knowledge of the material before an exam. You start with an overview of what's been covered, and add the details you remember. When you stop, that's a good demarcation between what you know and what you don't know, and filling in the details is your review. I have sometimes made study guides for a class that allowed them and then never used it on the exam, not because it was useless but because the process of making it taught me everything I needed to know.
7. __If Studying With Other People, Prepare/Study Beforehand__  
Don't be the guy that comes to a study group knowing nothing, even your friends don't want to spend time going over every detail. Have a set of questions/problems that are really stumping you. You'll probably find that either it's stumping them too and you can use the study group time to solve it together, or someone solved it already.
8. __Classes Stack Up__  
If you did poorly in ICS 6B, ICS 6D, or ICS 46 you will have a hard time in many upper-division courses. If you do poorly in 6N or 2A/B/D, you will have a hard time in CS112 and CS178. If you do poorly in ICS51 you will have a hard time in CS143A. If you really want to take a class look through the pre-reqs and assess how you did in them. If you didn't do so well, review beforehand or don't take it.
9. __Preview Classes, Shop Around__  
Many professors you'll be taking a class with have taught it before. They might have publicly-available websites with syllabi and past homeworks and exams. Take a look at it and ask ""Does this sound fun? Do I understand anything in the first lecture slides?"" 
[Multitask]: https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95256794
10. __The Brain is Single-Core, Lecture Time==Study Time__  
Are you the guy that spends lecture playing games on his phone or switching between Facebook, Discord, Slack, Reddit, ~~hentai~~ and back again? Maybe you should put that stuff away. [You learn better with a pencil and paper than with a laptop.] [notes] [Multi-tasking is the biggest load of crap ever.] [multitask] Lecture time spent well is study time that doesn't need to be spent catching up. If you're not even going to pay attention, save time and don't show up. 
11. __Build to Learn__  
For CS161 I found it useful to write out the algorithms in a programming language, put some print debug statements at critical points in the code, and test it on real inputs. For CS141 I would write out small programs that printed out the sizes of structs + unions and did the different parameter passing conventions and so on to give me a real correct output to compare my pencil-and-paper calculations with. Sometimes making a tangible, concrete example is the best way to understand.
12. __Work on Personal Projects__  
This is typically a tip given for finding a job, but it helps with classes too. Doing personal projects can help inform you on what advanced classes you would like to take next, and make your reason for taking a class more than ""I guess it sounds like it's good to learn.""
[ACT]: https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED506252.pdf
13. __Have a Long-Term Goal__  
All of these classes are leading up to something. Either you're getting a job in industry (what field? what company? what skills are needed?) or you're going to grad school or you're going your own way. If you can see a purpose and common thread in the classes you're taking [you'll perform better] [ACT].

I've been casually dating around on Tinder and I usually go on a different date every weekend just for the heck of it. More often than not, it doesn't amount to anything. I'm pretty shy and timid (guy) so I'm pretty slow to initiate intimacy, but every so often I'll meet up with a dtf girl that dominates the situation and we end up doing the dirty. 

A week before Thanksgiving break I squeezed in a last minute date with some girl I matched with on Tinder, and it started with such a nonchalant convo about tattoos and things to do in SoCal (we are both pretty new residents). I casually asked her if she wanted to meet up for seaside donuts in NP because I heard they were really good but hadn't actually been there yet, and she was down for it. I legit thought it was going to be just an hour or two of awkward convo with donuts and that'd be it, but we really clicked. Donuts turned into walking on the beach turned into cruising in my car to exploring SoCal to dinner to night beaching etc. Like, we really hit it off. What we both were thinking would be like an hour or two turned into something upwards of 10 hours on our first date. And this is where the story gets interesting... 

Now, we're both kinda freaks - in a dirty way. We shared a lot of intimate details with each other on our first date because we just go so comfortable so fast, and it made the conversations just that much more pleasant. By the end of the night, I would casually mention she looks hot because she's starting to let her hair down and her makeup starts to fade, and I think it's really attractive when a girl relaxes and is comfortable enough to be low maintenance. We got to the beach at night just because there's nothing else to do, and it's cold as balls so we sit next to each other huddled in a beach towel. Then she stares at me and I look into her eyes and I'm just like ...woah. Then we start making out and stuff. Pretty intense but it felt really natural because, again, we just clicked so well so fast. So we're at the beach for like an hour just making out and talking, and me, being the weird mf that I am, start to ask her things like if she likes me or if this is just a fling or whatever.. but to my surprise she says that she does like me and I'm unlike any other guy she's been on a date with. So I'm over here just like stroking my ego after that being told that, and I'm like so proud of myself for getting a girl to like me by just being myself and yada yada. So the night ends with just a late night cruise around OC and she's in the passenger seat just telling me how much she likes the simple things we do while she's slowly falling asleep, and I'm thinking wow, this girl is kinda really different than the others I've gone on dates with. At this point I'm driving to her apartment to drop her off and she's just acting like a freak now. Like, she keeps telling me how horny she is but she doesn't put out on the first date, and I'm like... yeah, then don't! I think it's too soon, and I don't want you to feel like you have to etc. So I drop her off but like, based off her mannerisms and how she was talking when I dropped her off, I could tell she wanted to bang hard, but being the gentleman that I am, I had to pass.. especially because I was starting to feel like I didn't want to screw anything up with her by acting too fast and making it just a fling with her. 

I go home and immediately knock out, but when I wake up I see that I received a text from her last night saying goodnight and thank you for such an amazing date to which I reply with a you're welcome and I want to see you again soon. Now this has never happened to me before - I've never had to deal with feelings and emotions when I date, so I didn't know how to act.. so I just acted without thinking. And so here's where it gets even more interesting. 

So like I said, I thought the first date with her wouldn't have amounted to anything, so beforehand, I planned another meetup with a different girl for the day after (today)... and I just had to cancel it because I really wanted to see this girl again, so I text her saying let's meet up and walk around the mall or something, and again, she's down and says she really wants to see me too. Good sign, good sign, right? So this is like now an immediate second date, hormones are still a rage from last night but it's a little more awkward because feelings has set in and idk how I should act and she's not sure how she should act either. So we're hanging out and holding hands with an occasional kiss here and there, and then we start to talk about what we're going to do next. And almost out of nowhere, she's like.. can we go somewhere to make out? And I'm like heck ya! So we go to my car and it's just like intense and we're sucking face and all. And so we're just going for it. Planning to ""netflix"" and chill at my apartment here. All the while, I'm thinking wtf am I doing.. is it too soon and will I mess something up? So fast forward when we're in my apartment. And mind you, this is VDC so the paper thin walls is a real thing.. 

So things get hot and heavy while we watch netflix, and clothes start coming off and it's great! She's sexy af and thicc af - just my type of body type, and she's really receptive to everything we're doing. Then, she stops and just stares into my eyes, and in just the most ""I want this right now"" tone of voice, she says ""I want you to f*ck me"" LOL Now here's where I f*cked up! Like this is everything I've ever wanted: an awesome girl who has so many things that I like, great chemistry, and sex. Idk why this happened but to put things lightly, I was trying to pitch a tent with a piece of string. Just was not happening no matter how hard (lol) we both tried. I kept apologizing and she was being so cool about it, telling me not to worry and that cuddling was good too, trying to make me feel better. We kept trying throughout the night (she ended up sleeping over) but Mr. Johnson was just not ready to get out of bed. Like, I felt as if my man card should've been revoked because I missed out on an awesome opportunity. And it probably didn't help that my floor mate probably heard it all happening lol. But one thing that really surprised me was that after the failed attempts, we just decided to cuddle and talk and she gave me the biggest hug and said ""I didn't think I'd like you this much"" and that put the biggest smile on my face, and everything was just perfect at that moment. We both still had a really good time together even though I basically blue balled her. 

And the next morning when I dropped her off home before she had to go to work, we kept talking about the next time we would see eachother (because thanksgiving weekend, we both had travel plans). I told her my feelings that I wasn't sure if I wanted her to be my gf but if we kept it up, then it looks promising to me. And she agreed. So we kiss goodbye and for a week we just text, but it's awkward because we've been so intimate already that it just feels insufficient to just text. And so as the break reaches the end and we both return to our normal lives in Irvine, I'm getting excited to see her and I keep texting her to ask when we can hang. She's replying pretty intermittently but I just assume she's busy with family stuff on the holiday. But basically, once we settled back to our normal routine, I tell her that I want to see her and she replies with ""I don't think we're going to work out, but I still want to be friends"" and I'm just dead. Idk what happened, honestly. After thinking about that night we spent together for a week, I figured that I just liked her too much and didn't want to risk being just a ons to her, so my willy wouldn't work in hopes that we could preserve that bond between us. But now I'm just like... if I would've known that I would be a ons, I should've just done it because not only have I missed out on a great intimate opportunity with a hot babe, but I now also missed out on being with this girl. And now, a few weeks later, here I am writing about it on reddit to share my story and psa that you got to calm your hormones and think about what you're doing... before you act on impulse and get yourself hurt. But happy ending, I guess, we're still friends on IG and there's no bad blood! 

Anyways, good luck on finals everyone and I hope this story was entertaining and you learned a thing or two!

TL;DR got my hopes too high up with a tinder date and now I'm paying the price with blue balls and a broken heart"

No friends to share my disappointment with, so I figured I would make my first post here."
7jg3nd,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/7jg3nd/ics_31_rant/,ICS 31 Rant,26,43,2017-12-12 18:33:56,"So, as I'm sure most of you know, ICS 31 is notoriously difficult to get in to. Today, ICS Student Affairs posted on Facebook that they would open ICS classes up to non-majors at 5:30 PM. I had all of my codes copied and listed next to me at 5:15. 

At 5:30, I instantly get onto WebReg and try to sign up for my classes. No luck. It's still major restricted. I have the ICS Student Affairs Facebook page pulled up as well as the Course list for ICS 31 and am constantly refreshing both for a solid half an hour.

By 6:10, the classes still are all major-restricted and open. Then, the U/U Facebook page posts an update stating that classes for ICS are supposed to be opened. This causes an influx of people that were ""not on top of things,"" and eventually the demand is so great that classes aren't even opening but WebReg was crashing and at maximum capacity.

With no indication, they opened one or two discussions, even though WebReg is already crashed and broken. They then begin to weirdly expand and open some classes while leaving others closed. 

This all happened within a span of 2 minutes (this should have happened when they said they'd open the classes). At 6:30 I was FINALLY able to log in to WebReg (all I'd gotten before that was a long series of disconnects, notifications that WebReg was full, and Login Authorization Expiration notices). 

I got to 15th on the Waitlist for a discussion and somehow got into the lecture. I was so pissed at this point that I finally let out a breath, thinking that I at least had a chance of getting in. I even logged out and back in to make sure. I was good.

Just kidding. About 10 minutes later I get dropped from the Lecture AND my waitlisted class. At this point I'm dead inside because WebReg is still flipping out but I manage to get back in. I try to get into a class that states itself as waitlisted. Nope, it says it's full. Same with the lecture.

 This system is flawed, broken and unfair. I just want to die.
Btw this whole process occurred even while I have my Writing 39C final project due at midnight but I had to hop on and rant because I'm absolutely pissed."

It has gotten to the point where I don’t go to class in fear I would see him. I know this isn’t a super serious reason but I was wondering if I could appeal.

I love the look of the campus, yet at the same time find it to be a pain in the ass to traverse. I dislike the location of the paths in the park, I don't like the lack of good study spots, at least what I consider good study spots. 

I like the semi higher end status of UCI, I mean everyone knows it's the biggest UC of its size, yet I am burned out on the quarter system and the marathon of work and tests.

Maybe it's just senioritis, but I'm ready for it to be over, yet I do really like the place. I worked hard to get in, it was my top choice as a transfer,  and now I'm focused on grad school and transitioning out. 

By the way I may have a choice of cal state grad school (semester) and UCLA (quarter) what do you think you would do? Tough call. Commute 65 miles for 2 years of 5 classes and practicum per quarter at UCLA  vs  a 35 mile commute for 2 years of 5 classes and practicum per semester at LB State. I'm an MSW major btw, well once I transfer, currently PSB. 

When I started at uci I would go around for fun and take pictures around campus, now I can't wait to leave lol, can't stand the long lectures all for a degree that just leads to another degree.

Made a few good friends, had many good laughs, and overall I'm better for having come here, but I look forward to June. Thanks for reading please do share, vent, process, etc. zot zot!

Well here's the information I've gathered, and you do with it what you will so I don't have to see these posts appearing everywhere and you don't have to spend time writing a post, yourself.

On the [website](http://senate.uci.edu/uci-academic-senate-manual/part-ii-regulations/) of UCI's Academic Senate under Academic Regulations, ""Section 2: Grades and Credit
Regulation A345. Grading"", Subsection C: Correction of Grades, it clearly states:

""All grades except Incomplete are final when filed by an instructor in end-of-quarter course reports. However, the correction of a clerical or procedural error may be authorized as the Division directs. (See IR A365.) No change of grade may be made on the basis of reassessment of the quality of a student’s work. No term grade except Incomplete may be revised by reexamination except as provided in IR A365.""

Now for those of you retaking a class, Section D: Course Repetition (Undergraduate) goes into detail on how the entire procedure works, who qualifies for it, how it will affect your GPA, and so on. 

Edit: Grammar. Removed last paragraph. And where it gives the exception ""as provided in IR A365"", it details correcting grades for clerical/procedural errors as well as correcting grades for those discriminated against"

Seriously though, I do not know what to do. All classes related to my major are full and when I say full, I mean full, like there is no room what so ever. Luckily for me, the GEs that I need to take are also full, but I can still waitlist. What does this school expect from me? To take classes that I do not need to take just so I can have 12 credits so I do not get kicked out of engineering? Guess I could take a boring history class...

I ask my professor his thoughts on quantum mechanics and partial derivatives. He's impressed i know about the subject. We converse after class for some time, sharing mathematical insights; i can keep up. He tells me of great things ahead like series and laplacians. I tell him i already read about series on wikipedia. He is yet again impressed at my enthusiasm. What a joy it is to have your professor visibly brighten when he learns of your talents.

And now I sit here wondering what it must be like to be a brainlet, unable to engage your professor as an intellectual peer. All of the deep conversations you people must miss out on because you aren't able to overcome the intellectual IQ barrier that stands in the way of your academic success... it's so sad. My professor and I know each other on first name basis now, but i call him Dr. out of respect.

And yet here you brainlets sit, probably havent even made eye contact with yours out of fear that they will gauge your brainlet IQ levels.

A true shame, but just know it is because i was born special that i am special. I can't help being a genius, nor can my professor. Two of a kind is two flocks in a bush."

 I and by extension most other Anteaters like to make use of the loud engine noises coming from the current shuttles by making a vroom vroom sound under my breath as the bus accelerates. I do this so I can feel like a racecar driver zooming around a track. I fear that because of the quiet nature of electric vehicles, the engine will not make a loud enough sound for me to do this. I need this because this is the only thing in my life that makes me feel like I have control. I have not tested what it sounds like in one of the new electric buses because I am worried that if I am unable to go vroom vroom I will suffer an emotional breakdown and fail all my midterms. I understand that the current buses have issues. They are very bad for the environment, break down often, and cannot accomodate the needs of all the students. Despite these issues I think we as a community need to make a sacrifice for the mental health of our students and give up these electric buses. 

If you are also worried about preserving the time-honored traditions that hold our community together, come to the ARC solar panels tonight at midnight to help me protest electricity. 





EDIT: It was brought to my attention that there is a simple solution. We could still use the electric buses but they could hire someone with a deep voice to sit in the bus and make engine noises. This is a solution that is better for the envrionment and creates a lot of jobs.

They have formed a tight-knit clique that gather like a small flock in the common room, laughing and enjoying each other's company whilst I remain a friendless recluse. The lack of interaction and validation has become utterly unbearable. Recently, I noted that Kylie Jenner's pregnancy propelled her back into fame and caused a steady cascade of attention and doting, so I have decided to become pregnant myself. Now I just need someone to bust a zot within my uterus. Once I'm pregnant, everyone will be forced to pay me the attention I crave and deserve. Furthermore, I can complain about cramps to my heart's content and sleep with pillows between my legs to relieve tension. However, I need a willing Peter to Beater his Eater inside me for this to work. I am committed to my pregnancy and being a guy will not stop me. I stand resolute and ready for this next chapter in my life."

As two wild anteaters are set on opposite sides of the campus, it will truly follow the theme of The Truman Show, as in, we will record and watch every move these two wild anteaters will make to fall in love and procreate to create a tradition. A tradition that will exceed the span of our lives and beyond.

But how can they be tamed or fed in such an urban campus? The act of taming two Anteaters will be rough but we can send out a form relieving me, UCI, or the actual anteaters themselves from any legal problems. As to the second point, the anteater can roam around the dorms and pick ants off or maybe go to the Anteatery itself and eat there (the salad bar is filled with delicious ants).

I will gladly lead this initiative and will personally hunt for two anteaters myself. Please forward this post everywhere to be apart of this historical moment.

Thank you."

Awkward shifting in the toilet seat, coughing repeatedly,  getting toilet paper over and over to make more noise, then no movement, dead silence. 10-15 minutes later and no one has left the stall.

I'm a very good match maker, and I am thinking of expanding my skills from my group of friends to the greater UCI community. 

Basically we would set it up like an agency. We would interview you about your personality likes and what you're looking for in a partner, then we would look at a bunch of random pictures and you would pick out pictures of people who you would date, and who you would pass on, so we can get an idea of who you consider in your league. 

Once we find 2 people who are a likely match, we would get to talking. Everyone would be anonymous until we're absolutely sure that they're good enough of a fit that they would spend at least 2-3 dates together. 

Think of us like an agent for a high profile movie star. You wouldn't have to mess with anything until we find you a solid fit. It's not like we're going to be a paid dating service where make commission off each match. We would make commission on the flowers and condoms we'll sell at our concession stand. "

Your face defines what it means to look “meh”. I honestly could not believe that such plain looking people exist. I think the girls that were around you couldn’t believe it either, they looked so stunned and I think one girl even took out her phone to take a selfie cuz she just got bored from looking at you. Like Oh man if i had seen you in the library i would have mistaken you for a book. 

I am so jealous of you. Cuz of how plain you look. But also cuz of that plain girl thats holding onto ur arm. She loves you doesn’t she? She looks happy, she looks secure, she looks like shes either on elephant tranquilizers or she’s lying on a really soft and comfy cushion. I’m sure that she loves you not because you are rich (dude its time to get new closed-toe shoes when I can see that u need to cut ur toenails), not because ur pretty (or ugly, cuz ur just smack middle, idk how u do it), not because you do her laundry. She loves you for who you are.

You must be a really interesting person. You have people to love and people that love you. You are an intricate machine made through billions of years of evolution (or nah, cuz it looks like god made u when he was procrastinating before he made the world in seven days). I guess that you have hobbies, you have personalities and whatnot. You’re walking, that means that you have somewhere to be, something to do. You have a meaning in life, something motivates you. You are alive. And thats just beautiful.

This happened to me and a couple people I know personally and some others I met on the Internet. Where most schools would either waitlist you or release a final decision on whether or not you get in, UCI will sometimes just flat out reject you and then suddenly accept you later.

I got rejected by UCI on the normal admissions decisions day, and was pretty depressed about it since it was my first choice school. On the last day to submit SIR, I was about to commit to UCSD as an undeclared freshman going into Comp Sci (which is a terrible idea considering the ridiculously impacted nature of their CS program right now and the fact that getting into it is 100% random chance now) but I logged into my UCI admissions page right before hitting submit out of pure sadness and, lo and behold, I was suddenly accepted.

Of course, I'm not saying to expect to be accepted out of nowhere if you do get rejected, because I don't want to get anyone's hopes up for nothing.

1. For most questions, it's best to call your department. For questions about things like how your financial aid works, transfer grade issues, major requirements, call (or email) your department directly to ensure accurate and up to date information. To find the contact information, click here, and scroll down to find your major.

2. Have a question about student experiences and thoughts? Use the search bar! Try inputting key words from your question into the search bar to see if it has been asked

3. We're here to help. Not sure if it's been asked before? Too nervous to call your department? When in doubt, just make a post. We can help you figure out how to best get you the information.

I just wanted to say that its ok to feel down sometimes, just use whatever got you down to learn from and you will come out stronger on the other side of it. Everyone goes through shitty periods in life, and college is stressful as hell (I say this as someone who has attended UCI for 2 degrees and 6 years total). 

Get inspired, formulate a plan, push yourself and everything will work out.

EVERYTHING WILL BE OK!

Tip: After a hell of a day/week/month before going to bed last thing Ill do is pull up youtube or Spotify and listen to a song that will pump me up to wake up the next day. There are many genres and tastes, but I think this one is a good one. If you are feeling down, just give it a listen...  everything will work out and you will be happy, just power through what you gotta do now to succeed! Very few people get to where they want to be without stress/pain/failures, most are just pretty good at hiding that pain/stress/failures, but it still burns on the inside.

IT WILL BE OK!

If you're taking ICS 33 don't forget to fill out the evaluation (he gives 3 points for filling it out and an extra 3 points if 95% of the class fills it out). If you're sitting there with a 99% in the class right now, maybe those extra 6 points can boost you to a 99.2% or if you're sitting at an 89% maybe those points can boost you to a 90%! This doesn't just apply to ICS 33 either, filling out evaluations is a great way for professors to reflect on their work and improve in the future. "

1. If possible PICK YOUR OWN DAMN ROOMMATE (ESPECIALLY IF ITS A DOUBLE)  
Made the mistake of saying fuck it, and chose a random roommate and I paid the price.  I know a lot of people will object and tell you it gives you the chance to meet and get close to new people, but I honestly think it's not worth it on the off chance your roommate is an absolute fucking weirdo or annoyance.  Try your best to at least get a roommate that isn't terrible and that you know.  This might not be as much of a problem if you are in a triple quad because then the chance you have two weirdo fucking roommates is much lower, which brings me to my next point.

2. I SERIOUSLY recommend getting a triple or quad ESPECIALLY if you can't choose a roommate
I chose double and I chose wrong.  With a triple or quad, there's a much higher chance at least one of your roommates is normal.  Also, you will probably become really close to at least one of your roommates and this will obviously lead to more friends and connections in the future which is key for college.  Not to mention its cheaper than a double. 

3. HOUSE IN MESA (towers if possible)
Ok, I will get a ton of shit for this but whatever it's my opinion.  I went Middle Earth (ME) and it was the wrong choice yet again.  The only pros I can honestly admit to ME is the location.  It's a lot closer to classes which is great, HOWEVER, ME is pretty dead social and party wise.  Sure there are a few halls here and there in ME that have parties and if you really try you can probably find some.  However, visiting Mesa with friends it was a lot easier to find people that were having kickbacks and down to hang out.  The food is also another problem.  Before ME had the apparently godly Brandywine which served great food.  Sadly I did not get to ever eat there as this year Brandywine was shut down.  Now it's just Pippin Common which is eh.  The Anteatery, Mesa's dining common, looks much nicer and has a bit wider selection but the point is ME prior perk of Brandywine is gone so if older posts mention that ME is better because of food it isn't true anymore.  Another perk of Mesa is the towers.  The towers are quads, which sounds terrible at first, squeezing 4 people into one room, but its actually quite spacious for college at least.  And because of how new the towers are everything is much nicer looking and the rooms are somewhat soundproof, which is such another huge plus.  The towers are also great places to hang out with friends and have people over for small kickbacks and its always pretty fun there.  Overall the atmosphere of ME is just boring compared to Mesa.

I understand I will get hate for this, and I get it, but I'm just sharing my experiences and trying to help future anteaters not make the same mistakes I made.

I took the exam and finished it in about an hour and a half, and left to use the restroom. As I went to the restroom, a classmate walked up to me and asked if I would give answers to the exam. I said ""No"" then went to use the restroom. I got asked again and told me that there would money for me if I helped. I said ""No"" again, and went to wait for the exam to end and tell the professor. Unfortunately, the classmate was still there (I have no clue as to why, since I am sure that the professor would wonder why someone would leave saying the exam was done and then come back to finish it), so I had to talk about other topics until they left. After which, I told everything to the professor and advised me that things will be sorted out. Isn't it great when someone tries to get help on an **open notes exam**. Seriously was the exam that hard?

TL;DR: A classmate came up to me after I was done with my final and asked me to give the answers. I said ""No"" (twice) and told the professor afterward.

But this student was like, ""why, I'm not disturbing anyone"", so that's when the TA got heated! 
So the TA told the student he can leave if he wouldn’t put away the book, but the student argued that he had every right to stay in the class.

The TA started threatening to give the student a zero for all the discussions if he didn't leave the classroom, but this student did not budge. 

This next part is where shit goes down!
The TA looks pissed as hell and aggressively approaches the student, and I straight up think he is about to hit this kid, but instead he grabs his backpack and throws it outside the door and tells him if he wants his stuff he can go outside and get it. 
The student does not budge at all and says to all the students to watch what the TA is doing and that he is going to report him. The TA then retorts that he can just go ahead and try to report him. 

That aint the end though, the TA is repeatedly raising his voice at this student telling him he is disturbing class and to leave already.

He approaches the student, RAISES HIS HAND....AND HELLA SNATCHES THE BOOK from this kids hand. *lowkey reads the title of the book* and throws that shit outside too. 

One kid was siding with the TA telling the guy to leave, but Y’all I felt for the guy and I was so shook it felt like a 9.6 earthquake!

And this isn't even the best part! This student stayed in the discussion and was actually taking notes! I don't know who gave him that piece of paper and pencil (bless you), but this dude be taking notes AND participating in the discussion questions that the TA asked! And they weren't some BS/troll answers at all....he actually gave answers that pertained to the class!

So every time I shop there, I have them price match everything I get (I go to the cashier instead of self checkout and they easily do it all for me). So when I'm shopping I'm also looking up the item on target.com to see that they're not overcharging and tell them to price match / what their online price is. 

*** also, by using Cartwheel you can find a bunch more discounts, as stated in the comments :-)

For example, the last two purchases I have made: 
5 subject notebook:
store price:  $6.69
Target's online price: $5.99
by having them price match I saved 70 cents there. 

Hygiene item:
Store: $7.49
Online: $6.99
50 cents saved. 

I've done the same with pens, pencils, makeup, etc. 

Pretty much if you can find the item on their online website, it will always be cheaper. This goes for usually any non perishable food item since you're not gonna find prices for something like fruit or cookies online. I think things like Nutella etc. are up there though. 

So yeah, depending on the item this can save a good amount, and it definitely adds up. Usually in the range of 30-80 cents in my experience per item. Just a lil tip if ya need it "

Just a message to all of you, make sure to not ride your bikes, scooters, or skateboards on Ring Road and if a police officer tells you to stop, please do stop and follow their instructions. The police officer in the classroom who apprehended the student told all of us additional charges will be pressed on the student for resisting them. "

I spoke with the UCI police chief today about the rumors that have been going on in this subreddit and beyond about a threat to the school. It's an ongoing investigation but I wanted to make a few facts known:

- There is currently no evidence that a threat was actually made. The original and only source that people have called UCI PD about was a comment on this subreddit saying that a post was made on Facebook. UCI PD has been in contact with Facebook and the the admins of the Facebook page and students that made reports, and there are no logs or screenshots or any tracks that such a threat ever existed. Many people immediately reported the Reddit comment and likely would have done so for a Facebook comment if one had been seen.

- EDIT: Plus the person who originally made the comment saying they saw the threat (which is where all the information started) has said that it was just a joke and they didn't see anything.  They have deleted their account; attempting to doxx them or start a harassment witch-hunt will result in a ban.

- There is no reason to believe campus is not safe or that you should stay home from class. If you are worried or want to talk to someone about how you're feeling, the counseling center is aware of the rumors and has social workers ready to talk to students.

- Nonetheless, the police are taking it seriously and investigating it thoroughly, and will have additional resources on hand the next few days. So you may see an increased police presence on campus just to make sure everyone is safe.

- If you have seen the threatening message, or have helpful information, please contact the UCI Police Department at 949-824-5223.

I will update the sub if I find out any new information. You can ask questions if you want but I really don't know anything more than what I've shared above. I can tell you that many people are aware of what's going on and are working carefully on it.

So I asked myself, do all of the other UC subreddit accounts look like this?

The answer is subjective but objectively the minimalist design of r/berkeley and r/UCLA resembles the prestigious ambiance the name of each school radiates. 

Visiting r/UCSC shows their connection to the wilderness (and shit, they're high as heck! How can their subreddit be better than our bobba-drinking mods?). And r/UCSantaBarbara has an 8-bit image of their famous Storke Tower. 

Moreover, as a hater of puns and everything they stand for, r/UCR has the banner that states ""UCReddit"" and even that's better than our shitaldrichpark.jpg.jpg.jpg.jpg (needs more .jpg) banner. Even the infant r/ucmerced has a nice bobcat and when hovered over states, ""A Bobcat-Alien hybrid has been developed by U.C.M. scientists.""

Right now we are tied with r/UCSD and r/UCDavis. But even r/UCDavis makes up their pixelated banner with a nice uniformed, non-primitive subreddit look.

After opening up the cave of those feelings, I have discovered another door that held a flood of emotions stemming from school and life in general.

The mundane life of going to class, completing assignments, and doing nothing during our free time has amounted in underlying aggression. Having another consenting adult fight you is the perfect personification of your problems and other things that are wrong with the world and places it in front of you.

As you have the person in front of you, you can finally (and literally) beat the problems out and come out pounding with pride. It's not whether you win or lose, its the idea of letting out the anger and building friendships from within.

Also, please don't talk about this.

I am fully aware the School of Physical Sciences is not a popular school, at least compared to other popular schools like Engineering or Business. Now when I first arrived at UCI, I was not surprised at this absence of apparel for the School of Physical Sciences because I knew this already. However, the main reason I'm writing this rant is because right now The Hill is having a clearance sale and there are like 100+ items that have either ""Law"" or ""Music"" written on them. 

What the heck!?! The Hill now has a surplus of shirts for these really small schools/majors, but they *literally* do not have one single article of clothing for the School of Physical Sciences, or any major within it. Now I don't hate on people who choose niche majors like Law or Music, but this is absolutely ridiculous UCI! The Hill would be able to profit much more if they switched it around and actually marketed apparel based on the popularity of the school displayed (which they kinda do already). I feel so left out seeing people wearing ""Psychology"" or ""Pharmaceutical Sciences"" sweaters while us Math, Physics, Chemistry, and Earth System Science majors get diddly squat. Heck, even my GRANDMA can get a sweater with her own damn label on it but we Physical Science students still get nothing for ourselves.

UCI's advisors kinda helped but I didn't think so since you know the classes you want but the problem is you can't even enroll in them since they get full so fast or it is all rng by seeing who sins up first. For current people in uci undeclared still don't give up you can do it! I know it's hard and stressful to not get the classes and if you knew more about how bad this undeclared status label even though you know what major you want from my experience from talking to 99% of undeclared people. I was like that also extremely discouraged but as long as you stay on top of things especially if you become a second year they will have to give you your class to declare otherwise you will have to stay a fifth year which might suck but you have to decide if the degree is worth that much time and money.

TLDR: undeclared is bad don't do it unless you have to, stay on top of things and don't give up

Like im surprised there isnt a shit post about it yet (or if there is and i just havent seen it). Idk maybe its just me but..... like its not my job to convince u to come to uci and theres a lot of things u should consider when u think about what school you go to but u also shouldnt expect people to explain why u should go to their school. Thats a decision i feel like u need to make for urself. Theres lots of big decisions to make as u grow up and this may be the start of them but u shouldnt rely on randos on the internet to make the tough decision for you.

That recruiters would be fighting for my resume. It's week 6, I'm about to graduate unemployed. Looks like I failed

Here's some advice so you dont ruin your life too:

* Get a fucking internship. *

Everyone that I know that has a job lined up got an internship at some point. Everyone that I know that's graduating jobless did not get an internship. What's worse, many companies restrict internships to people enrolled in college. (So if you're like me, you're SOL if you graduate without one). This might be controversial, but don't waste your time with research (unless you want to go to grad school) --  internship &gt; research. 


* Apply to internships in the fall *

I didn't know that most internships recreated around the new year. I wish I did. 

* Do Leetcode problems *

Make a github and upload your solutions. Don't just upload any O(n^3) trash though. Internship + leetcode = Job. This might be controversial, but leetcode is honestly more important than personal projects (more on that in the next point)

* Learn JavaScript/HTML/CSS *

It looks like practically every software developer position expects you to know them. I'm not even joking, it looks like practically 2/5th+ of software jobs are webdev now. I wish they still taught ics 21/22 in java. This would be a good place to tack on a personal project. The ics school lets everyone have there own website, so pimp it out

* There are no entry level C++ jobs *

If all you know is C++, then you're SOL. I'm not saying that there are no C++ jobs out there, it's just that there's not many for new grads. Most are in C# or java or ... If all you know is Python, then lol.

It’s not a concert. Sitting at a graduation isn’t even fun. The only reason the tickets have value is because people have family and friends who love them. 

I think that by selling them, you’re just costing students more money. They shouldn’t have to pay money just to have their family at their graduation.

TL;DR if you have have extra grad tickets like I did, give them away. Don’t be a dick and try to scalp your fellow students, just because they want their family there.

Many students have emailed Professor Morrissette about their issues with the test, and here are some selections from her collective response:
&gt; Hi Students,
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; I have gotten many emails from students about the exam results.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Some of you have suggested that your low score may be due to your exam being in the wrong version pile. This cannot be the case. I worked with my TAs (Herlinda and Catherine) to check all of the exam question sets to make certain that they were sorted correctly into 4 versions.
&gt; 

So apparently, it's impossible for any of those 3 individuals to make a mistake. It's also impossible for the students that took the test to have put down the wrong version number (version A1 was version A, version A2 was version B, version A3 was version C, and version A4 was version D. It's pretty simple to see that people could make the mistake of bubbling in A if they got version A2 for example, seeing as there's literally an A there, and they wouldn't see another exam to compare the version to.

&gt;However, I will say that before the scores were uploaded we looked at the statistics for each question and in all cases that I examined, the correct answer from they key was chosen &gt;20% of the time, something that only happens when it is the correct answer.

This is just incorrect. The incorrect answer can be chosen more than 20% of the time, what? Genuinely, what is that?

Anyway, she said there will be a way for students to receive their scantrons back to compare to the answer key, so all of the issues will be almost certainly resolved. 

So why am I writing this you ask?

Because I'm frustrated that a test that was completely multiple choice taken more than a week and a half ago just recently had the grades released, and a lot of them were done wrong. Then, when students rightfully complained about the issue, our Professor just put all of the blame on us. She responds so rarely and so disrespectfully to the issues that I just wanted to give my interpretation of the events (that may well be wrong). Especially for the students who received 40%s on a test they likely should've gotten an 80% on and are panicking about their grade in the class for issues of no fault of their own, I felt that they should know that you're not alone in being frustrated and concerned, and that the issues will be resolved when you actually receive your scantrons back.

I've been trying out different things (though not diving too deep into these) like iOS development with Swift and some web dev HTML/CSS and looked into JavaScript today. I'm not sure if it's because I haven't really dived into these for too long but I feel like I'm not really interested in them. I don't know what I'm interested in. I don't know what kind of projects to even work on.

With all the ICS / CS classes I've taken, I never really loved or hated any of the assignments we've had to do. There's been satisfaction at some points when I finish projects, but I guess that's it. 

Does anyone have any advice for me on what to do next? What kinds of things I should try out or learn? I'm honestly pretty scared that I'm graduating in a year and I have no idea what I'm going to do. Scared that I'm not going to find a job.

I first want to start off by saying that I've been fortunate, thankful, and prideful for getting accepted to UCI, especially in the CS field. I'm lucky to have had the assets to get me to where I am today. But it's only my first year, and I'm in a really tough spot, not just at school, but at home and life. Family life has been extremely difficult for me. Seeing the disintegration of my parent's marriage, and seeing the effects that it has been taking on my mom, and seeing a disconnection between my dad and me, which was so strong before, has definitely affected my performance as a student and as a person. I work 20\-25 hours a week off\-campus at a coffee shop to help provide for myself and as backup because my parents are becoming more financially unstable since we didn't really plan ahead. And to top things off, I've been on academic probation this quarter. Balancing between school, work, and the situation with home has really taken its toll on me, to the point where I'm considering about not even finishing school. I'm second\-guessing my major choice\- I wanted to go into the CS field because my dad and sister did it, but I've learned that I'm not really passionate about it, nor good at it. I have become frustrated with the UC quarter system\- I feel like I'm not being given enough time to process what I've learned, and to me, it's more about racing against the clock to get projects done on time by throwing stuff at the wall and see what sticks \(this is a personal opinion, I know some people may think differently and I respect that\). And I'm not blaming the UC system for my hardships. I just wasn't ready for it, outside forces, and some dumb decisions I made just made my experience even worse. I know my life isn't over if I do end up getting kicked out of UCI, but I really don't know what to do if I do. Go to CC and transfer somewhere else? But wouldn't it look bad to other colleges if I got kicked out of UCI? Just drop out entirely and find another passion? I really do want to start up a YouTube channel with my friends and family or make music, but I don't know how to start, and it seems risky to me. I just want advice. I just want to know if any of you have had a similar experience to me, whether it be family struggles, or getting kicked out of any college. If so, how did you pick yourself up, what did you do to improve yourself, and what are you doing now? Thank you for your time, and to those who want to help by giving me advice, I appreciate it. "

Hello everyone, I'm a first\-year international student studied in UC Irvine for computer engineering, last week I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder with the doctors' note，and I found it hard for myself to focus on school life and take charge of my time. I 'm in deep depression and hard to fall asleep in the night time and can barely go class on daytime. Do anyone know what should I do? I've paid 14,000 $ for one quarter's tuition and I really don't want to waste my parents' money, but I'm also worrying that if my mental&amp;health condition gets worse that would brings down my GPA too\(I've already signed an academic contract\),  where&amp;who should I talk to pause my school life for some months so that I can take a break or should I persistent to keep going through this quarter?

I'm swamped by stressful things and hope someone can give me some advice. 

Appreciated,

A freshman."

We ended up having a really good talk and clicked pretty well. i havent been happy or laughing as of lately, but this dude totally opened me up, made my day and i couldnt  laughing when i was with him. 

i couldnt really catch his name but i do remember he had a kind of dirty blond hair, was wearing a white tshirt and had a cap on and was a first year i think.

I have friends, but I keep them at a distance. Since I was 9, I started having suicidal thoughts due to some unfortunate circumstances that dragged on till I moved to college. UCI has been the happiest time of my life, since before I would constantly fight all my suicidal urges. Even when I made attempts I would stop midway and look in the mirror and tell myself ""You choose to live, you have to see it through, you can't be selfish"". 

Now: I think I've gotten pretty close to the edge. I always thought I'd be able to last as long as Chris Cornell did, battling depression till I eventually kill myself in my 50's. But I've found myself clearing out my room, looking for a home for my hamster, pretending I'm ok with my friends, as if I'm trying to end my life cleanly without inconveniencing anyone. 

Main point: For anyone who's been in my position, or knew anyone who did, how do you fight this? I want to die but I want to try to live. Please recommend any books or activities, because I've tried therapy and it doesn't help. It makes me feel worse because I constantly feel pressured to get better or have enough money to pay the therapist. Also constantly feeling bad for wasting my session since I never manage to tap into my actual problems since I either forget about it at the moment or distrust the therapist to elaborate on my feelings. Please, I want to keep fighting but I also want to end the voices in my head.  "

TL;DR, you're gonna be fine so long as you're using your time right. There are some really shitty finals out there that make no sense (cough cough Wu), but I promise you will live. Let's look at the options here:

A) Hey, you passed the class, which means you're one step closer to proving yourself to employers. They care little about your final grade; they mostly want to see what you can do. You did come here to learn and do stuff, right?

B) You fail the class, which means you'll have to take it again. This is okay, it means you get a second shot at learning some basics (talking to you 6B folk), which you will need to have picked up.

The worst thing you can do to yourself is pass a class and take away absolutely jack squat from it. I've done it before, and I honestly wish I could re-take them - ICS6N turned out to be rather important for object collisions in 3D spaces, and I kinda blew it off like it was irrelevant... whoops. Back to flipping through books to pick up the pieces of my education.

If you're still worried because you're checked out AND stressed, well, join the club! You will do great things in life so long as you have the desire to, perfect grades or not. People want to see action, not numbers.

Take the time to figure out what you want to work towards, and send yourself down that path. If you need your finals done perfectly to get somewhere you want, then do them again, this time with feeling! Everything else, forget about it - we live too short to worry for so long.

I think this post is rambling and cheesy as hell and I honestly want to delete it, but I'm posting it anyway in case it helps someone feeling down about their finals. So long as you're not in the hospital, you have the power to change your life, so go for it. c:"

8v5uaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/8v5uaq/advice_for_new_transfer_students_from_a/,Advice for New Transfer Students from a Graduating Anteater Transfer,66,15,2018-06-30 16:25:29,"Hello fellow Anteater Transfer,

Here is an outline of what helped me to do very well at UCI and accomplish all my goals.

For one I would encourage you to collaborate with other transfer students and establish a sort of group of study friends in your major. There are probably Facebook groups for transfer students from your cohort and other UCI groups there. What I did was find some like minded hardworking students who I sat near in my first few classes and said hey, why don't we work together on a study guide for the midterm on a shared google document? This turned into friendships over time that were great. Set clear due dates taht everyone agrees to, if members can't meet those deadlines then do not include them in future study groups. So first thing I would recommend is do not try to do everything alone, teamwork works.

Secondly, the transition from 16 week semesters to 11 week quarters is different for everyone. You say you want to retain your GPA which tells me you probably have a good one. I transferred over with a high GPA as well but was a psychology major, anyways, I did not find the transition as hard as I thought I would. I think if you know how to organize your time, use a schedule, and have enough discipline to do well in community college in the semester system you will do just as well at UCI. It takes a quarter to get used to the quarter system, for us they suggested starting out with 3 classes rather than 4, and I think that was a good move. Also, start out with maybe a few easier classes so you can get used to the flow, then try and set up balanced quarters in future quarters where you have some easy classes and maybe one tough one. I use eater evals on EEE to see what previous students thought of a class or professor, also when you look up a professor on ""eater evals"" it shows you all the classes they have ever taught and what quarter/year they taught them and this helps if you want to see a syllabus for that particular professor for a particular class they taught in the past that you want to take in the coming quarter. Yes long sentence, whatever, this isn't being graded. I look up old syllabuses if I can on EEE on the ""course websites"" section that lets you look back in time, so I can see how the class is structured and what to expect. I also look on the ""Rate my Professors"" website to see what people say overall about a professor. Use this information how you like, personally I always aimed for quality over being easy, but I did avoid professors who had a reputation for being unnecessarily difficult or who were bad communicators etc.

There is only so much they can make you do in 10 weeks of instruction and 1 week of finals. Typically you will be assigned a chapter, sometimes two chapters (less common) to read per week, or a similar amount of research articles so expect to read around say 60-120 pages per week, at least that's how it was for me per class sometimes less.

Upper division tends to have more emphasis on the more enjoyable subjects of your major, at least mine did and classes tend to be a little smaller although large. Unlike community college were my classes typically had about 50 students, upper division classes at UCI are held in lecture halls that are similar to large movie theaters and they pack about 300+ people in there, sometimes less. I employed the same tactics I did in community college and sat near the front, but not in the front row generally.

Exams vary, but often classes were set up where we had 1 midterm on week 5 or 6 and one final on week 10 or 11. There were often a few papers you would write as well to make up other points or maybe a small presentation. So a typical loadout might be that you have a midterm and final worth 75 points each, a paper worth 25 points, a presentation worth 20 points, and 5 points attendance. You spread that over a quarter and that might mean you have that first paper due on week 3, the midterm on week 5, the presentation on week 8 and the final on week 11. Honestly so long as you schedule everything I think you will have plenty of time to do this, once you get the flow of it, and you will probably get the flow within a quarter.

Most people don't have time to read everything, most everyone I talked to reluctantly admitted they read about 20-50% of what was assigned, myself included. Generally you need to know key points for the exams, you don't need to know every tid bit of info in the book or readings. Very often professors will provide study guides or you can pretty easily determine what you should focus on. By working with a team of say 6 students, each student can be assigned a chapter or two to summarize into a study guide, by an agreed date. I'm not saying it's always necessary or best to do this, but it can help a ton in how you spread out your workload over a quarter.

Where this tactic does not work at all are classes that are based on mathematics, those as you probably know, you have to do yourself and there are no shortcuts to success. Thankfully because I was IGETC certified when I transferred to UCI, my math days were over and all I had to do was take my major requirements and electives.

So based on all that info above the most important thing of all if you don't do this already is learning to schedule time to get work done. For me I use 3 things to help me achieve this, I've used all 3 since I started community college and they have been central to my success.

One is that I have a simple notepad text document that shows all the homework assignments and their due dates with a section for me to mark my score out of say /100. When I get my syllabuses I go through and type out a list on this document that shows a list of the due date, the class, the assignment title, and the points/100. I also include in this document a section where I mark down how many absents are allowed and how many I use. If there is extra credit I record it here for each class as well. Lastly I have a section I call ""What I need for an A"" where I determine how many points I have to spare in each class so that in the end I still end up with first an A, then an A-, a B+, a B and so on.

The second document I use is a blank month calendar I created on MS paint that has spaces for 31 days. I open this up in MS paint and adjust the dates on the M - Su schedule to reflect that month. I list bigger objectives on this, major due dates and things like that and I keep a copy of this stuff in a real folder in my backpack called ""schedules."" If I need to add anything I can just write on it with a pen, it's a good way to stay on top of things.

The third thing I have is a weekly schedule, I set this up after the month one. This schedule is also a week M - Su schedule on MS Paint, but for each day there are 24 hours. I plan out my weeks with this, schedule time for reading, studying, my classes, and any special events or work. This helps me to know how much time I have to devote to other things that are also important like relaxing, unwinding, and doing non school things I care about. Taking time to relax is critical, almost as critical as getting a good nights sleep. One thing I learned as a psychology major is how important a good night sleep is, and also how helpful it can be to study a bit near when you go to bed before a test, always always try for at least 7 hours of scheduled sleep time.

The other thing that helps is renting study space in the various libraries on campus to work on a group project or study together, if that's your thing. Personally I can't focus when I'm trying to study with a group, anyways you can do that here https://www.lib.uci.edu/study-space-locator and you will see that under various building descriptions it says ""reserve a study room"" that can be helpful and you can book up to 2 hours a day. I usually put that I'm using the room with 1 other person, but actually use it myself, sorry world :) If you are curious to see what your class will look like and learn about the technology available follow this link and look up your classroom and see some specs http://www.classrooms.uci.edu/GAC/.

By doing all this stuff I went from being a high school drop out with a GED and some community college experience in the past with a bunch of Ws Fs Ds and Cs to show for it, to graduating with 2 associate degrees from community college with straight As, I got my BA from UCI and graduated summa cum laude, and I'm heading to grad school at the highest ranked grad program for my major in Southern California, my top choice school. I had an IQ test, I have an average IQ. My success was directly related to doing the above things, and I'm confident that if you insist upon finding the discipline to do all the above you will dominate as well. Best wishes fellow anteater!

He's Indian (or some kind of South Asian ethnicity) and was wearing a blue shirt with the sleeves rolled up and black jeans, and I also noticed that sometimes he wears glasses and uses white EarPods. He mentioned that he hated Reddit but couldn't leave it which is why I'm posting this here from my lurker account. He's about 6ft tall and always sat on the same seat throughout class, and raised his hand a lot for the jeoparody game. I also saw him trying to better his posture by sitting up straighter whenever he slouched which was adorable lol. I always thought he was cute but didn't actually build the courage to approach and talk to him until the last day of class.

He did mention his name, but I don't remember it at all but it did sound very ""ethnic"" (is that a politically correct way of describing it? Sorry). I kicking myself for not getting his phone number but I hope to see him on Wednesday for the final. I feel like a total fucking moron

If this is you or sounds suspiciously like someone you know please message me! If you know who this is maybe you could tell him that kacey did end up listening to kids see ghosts and she liked it a lot lmao kill me.

I know they mean the registration for tickets, but fam I do a search in gmail for ""commencement pre-registration"" and nothing shows up. I search for ""pre-registered"" and that email is the only thing that shows up. Why can't you be more clear about what you're saying if you're going to put it in panic font?"

As UC Irvine being the biggest UC of its size, why not integrate colorful trolleys on Ring Road?

The wideness of Ring Road has the potential to host two lanes, with about 5 carts for each direction. As the conductor mindlessly drives the trolley from 7AM to 10PM, they are readily available and students can hop on at any time. Going to MSTB? What a brutal trek! Hop on! Going from Langson to the Social Science Plaza? Hop on you lazy fuck! As the trolley will never stop for anyone, people are welcome to hop and go whenever they wish! It's that simple (To relieve UCI, the Conductors, or me of any responsibility, your quick half second hop on the speeding trolley will constitute your complete ability to sue any of us if you slip and fall. You will only get embarrassment and a good college story).

If this genius idea becomes popular, there should be an integration of a trolley system within the inner ring road. The steep hills will make it more enjoyable and will possibly give you a valid reason for missing lecture (i.e due to injury or death).

Douglas Kiester, an orthopaedic surgeon and professor at the public University of California at Irvine, donated a total of $1,150 to Nehlen between mid-2017 and late March 2018, after Twitter banned Nehlen. He also gave $250 to the campaign of Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who is known for creating brutal conditions at his jails, racial profiling, and then being convicted for criminal contempt after defying court orders to curb that profiling. 


Kiester responded to a list of questions about why he donated to Nehlen and Arpaio, whether he was aware of Nehlen’s white supremacist reputation, and how he might respond to potential concerns among his colleagues and students, with one sentence: “Are you aware that this is slander and therefore legally liable.” Sludge asked Keister to explain what about its inquiry was false information, but the professor did not reply.


John Murray, assistant director of communications for UC-Irvine Health, told Sludge, “Staff and faculty have the freedom to make personal political donations. These actions do not represent the university.”"

Several months ago, four members of our UCI community bravely reported incidents of sexual harassment within their school.

While reporting misconduct is always difficult, the actions of these women were particularly courageous because their reports involved one of the most prominent members of our faculty.

The Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity (OEOD) thoroughly investigated this matter, speaking to more than 60 witnesses. The investigation substantiated a number of sexual harassment claims against Francisco J. Ayala, the signature benefactor of the School of Biological Sciences, the central science library and several scholarly programs.

Our stance on sexual harassment and sexual misconduct is clearly communicated in our policies, guidelines and required training. Given the number and breadth of the substantiated allegations, along with the power differentials at play, I believe that keeping Professor Ayala’s name in a position of honor would be wrong.

Therefore, I decided to remove the Ayala name from the school and library. Similar changes will apply to the graduate fellowships, scholar programs and endowed chairs bearing the Ayala name. Following our standard consultative procedures, including a faculty review committee, Professor Ayala resigned without emeritus status, effective July 1, 2018, and will abstain from future campus activities. A public announcement regarding these decisions was issued a few moments ago.

Diversity advisors will work with the biology school’s students, faculty, staff and administration to provide additional training and counseling. A climate assessment is already underway, and focused education on reporting and intervention will be offered. We will do everything within our power to create an environment in which ideas and knowledge can thrive without fear of harassment, mistreatment or retaliation.

I sincerely thank those who had the courage to come forward – Professor and Chair Kathleen Treseder, Professor Jessica Pratt, Assistant Dean Benedicte Shipley, and graduate student Michelle Herrera – and apologize for any inappropriate behavior they experienced from a member of our faculty. Each stood up for what is right and should be commended.

Fiat Lux,

Chancellor Howard Gillman"

As their everlasting love is presented to the students of UCI, why not solidify their partnership? I petition to officially marry Harold and Maude to show that monogamy isn't dead and that love is absolutely real among every specie in the animal kingdom. 

As countless marriages have been held at UCI's University Club's garden, it seems like the ideal place for these two (*literal*) love birds to get married. Only about a 3 minute walk from their home, they can easily walk back and get freaky in the infinity fountain for all of us to see and cheer on. 

After passionate love making, we would all throw bread towards them and wait 28 days for mini Harolds and Maudes to hatch. After their ducklings are born, we can fly in more ducks to stir up the gene pool and start this tradition all over again.

Thank you once again for reading this shitpost and I will see you at their summer wedding. "

Talked to them for an hour (was afraid of being punched or yelled at in the process)... here is what happened (long post),57,55,2018-07-25 23:20:46,"I was walking to my car on ring road as as two people approached me and asked if I ever heard of God of Mother, Ive heard of them here on UCI subreddit, but I elected to say no since I didnt know anything besides the name, they then asked if I wanted to learn more about god's female image or something like that. I said ""Nope"" **and immediately regretted it.**

The guys said Ok and turned around. I was looking forward to asking them the important questions.

So as I continued around the ring road I saw another two individuals coming towards me, in my head I thought ""Please ask me about religion""... sure enough ""Sir do you have any questions about the bible?"" one of them said. ""YESSSSssss"" I high fived myself in my head.

Not letting the opportunity go by me again I initiated what turned out to be an hour long conversation. Basically an on the spot AMA. Now on here some people painted a pretty scary picture of them so I wasnt sure what to expect. To be honest I expected them to just walk away multiple times during the conversation. So here is the gist. Its not everything, but the main parts. 

**Bold is me**

*italics are their answers*

Conversation:

**Yes, I actually do. You know the great flood?**

*Yes*

**You know how there was two of each animal?**

*Yes*

**So, what did the lions and tigers and snakes, and other carnivores eat? Two deer and two zebras and two antelopes wont go far.**

*We dont know what they ate, but they had meals.*

**Isnt that kind of a big hole in that story?**

*Yes but it was the will of god that made them survive*

**Ok that seems a bit too convenient of an explanation, fine, what makes your religion so special compared to others?**

*We were formed in 1968 (i think was the date he gave), and we were taught how to read the bible and see its prophecies, all the major events have been named and predicted by the bible. Because thousands of years of events were predicted up to now and all of them were true, we have to believe that everything that it says about the future is true too*

**Wait, so you are saying your church was established in 1968, and it predicted stuff for thousands years of human history preceding it? Isnt that just a history book?**

*No we use the bible that was written thousands of years ago*

**Ok so you are saying that I can go to any church, catholic, christian, whatever, or just look up on the internet the standard Bible, and it will have all these prophecies in it?**

*Yes, but you need to learn how to read them, if you just look at it and read it you wont see the prophecies, you need to know where to look.*

**Let me guess, it predicted nations falling, rulers dying, wars happening? The things that have been happening for thousands of years that anyone can predict because they are generic enough?**

*No the people and places are named specifically*.

**That doesnt make any sense man, because this stuff would be known to everyone if it was true, unless you have some addendum written in 1968 by your church that just passes what already happened as a prophecy**.

*No its the standard bible*.

**Ok, lets pretend all these prophecies are really in the standard Bible, but you need to have a special gift to see them? Have you ever heard of causal fallacy? You are finding these things because you are looking for them. If it was not told through some obscure allegories or analogies and was concrete then everyone would know about them, but it sounds like you have to have blind faith in it.**

*The bible is real, we were taught how to read it and it has been proven to us that it is all true*.

**Ok man, who wrote the bible? Some man right? How is the Bible different from Harry Potter?** (here I probably shoulda used some other fairy tale because I know some religions frown on Harry Potter so I dont know if they even know what its about, maybe they think its a Witch book lol?).

*Yes it was written by man from the teachings of god*

**Wait, so why did God have to play telephone? Why not tell every one of the 6 billion people on this Earth and instantly gain 6 billion followers?**

Here I dont remember all the details of what they said, but basically they said that god is testing us (of course he is), and that there were some bad angels that started a war in heaven, so he doesnt want to announce it to everyone, only to those that are good so he can save them. he tells the prophet and prophet thhen tells everyone else.

To which I said:
**This makes no sense man, so he want to keep it on the down low by telling only one person, but then that person can tell everone else? How is that accomplishing keeping it on the down low?**

He then basically repeated what he already said (what I typed above), not answering the question.

Seeing that we were stuck I took it another direction:

**Ok, so what if I after this conversation just move on with my life, what will happen to me?**

*You will not be granted entry to heaven*

**Wait, so if I am a good person, I believe in being a good person, I basically do what the bible teaches without being religious, I dont get to go to heaven but you do?**

*Yes, because you chose not to believe in god*

**Isnt that kind of selfish of God? I mean I as a person think thats a terrible thing to do. I would never do something bad to someone just because they didnt believe in something. What if think that God is not good because of these selfish policies he has?**

Here he went on about the whole thing about the war and how if you dont believe if you are granted access to heaven you will be a bad angel and start another war, so thats why you wont be allowed in.

**Ok, man, so far you arent convincing me this God guy, he doesnt sound like he is good. Why should I care about him?**

*Because your life here on earth is temporary, there are now 3 million of us worldwide and we are tasked with letting people know about this, and once we are done it will be judgment day. You should care about God because it is by his will you are breathing right now. The day is closer and closer, look we had 5 hurricanes in a row, that never happened before, even scientists agree.*

**Wait, what? I got so many questions. First of all the hurricanes, thats a fallacy again, you are looking for it so you are finding it. Scientists explain all these things completely differently, like I am here breathing because I am a bunch of chemicals reactions happening all at once, and wait... when is judgment day?**

*Nobody knows, but soon*

I got images of Jonestown flashing in my head when he said that.

**But I thought you said that bible predicted everything?**

I dont remember what his answer was, but it was another run around that gave no real answers.

**Ok, why should I care about judgment day?**

*Because you will be granted entrance to heaven*

**Ok, what happens if I am not granted entrance to heaven?**

He said explicitly that I dont go to hell, but that I just wont be granted entrance o heaven.

**What about all the terrible things religions have done? The crusades and religious wars?**

*Those were all false religions created by the devil to mislead people.*

**So are you saying all those people prior to 1968 went to hell? Because none of them believed what you preach?**

This is where it got really weird, he gave me this timeline of like 500's through 1948 being some weird time when people were forgiven more easily, but starting in 1948 you are only granted entry to heaven if you believe, no easy way out.

**Have you ever heard of a ""cult""? What if you are in a cult?**

*We were shown how to read the bible and we believe everything it says is true.* (very unsatisfactory answer IMO)

**Ok so, what about a newborn that dies? They didnt have a chance to believe, do they not get to go to heaven?**

*They get put into a prison type thing where they are raised by god and then eventually are granted entrance to heaven once they follow his teachings*

**Oh great, sounds like that will be an option for me**

*No actually, because you were given this chance, god will know that you refused his teachings so you wont be given a second chance, because this is already a second chance for us here on Earth after the war in heaven.*

**Hmm, again God does not sound like a good guy, what if I am ok about not going to heaven and hanging out with him?**

*Thats your choice I suppose.*

At this point they said their bus was leaving and they had to go.... so I asked him one last questions.

**So what happens when in 70 years or whatever you die, and all this was fake? How will you feel?**

They kind of shrugged and went on about how Bible said all these things are true. To which I kept drilling that the Bible is just some book, it has as much credibility as Harry Potter, written by men, for men, used by thousands for personal gains, caused wars and death etc..

**See there are just too many holes in this thing** I said.

I asked them if they were UCI students, they said no but they had a club at UCI (I was surprised this kind of thing is allowed).

I shook their hand and told them

**I know the minute you walk away you are going to be telling each other that I was put here to test your faith. But hope you have a good life.**

I didnt tell them, but I feel really bad for them. It was like I was talking to a brainwashed zombie. It amazes me how they dont see fault in their own circular logic and fallacies throughout the whole idea.

I didnt get shoved or yelled at, for basically trolling them for an hour. I was genuinely interested though to find out how their minds explain the nonsense so I suppose thats not trolling.

Like I already said, Im not religious, but I do believe in being a good person. And am a firm believe in god isnt going to feed my family for me, nor put money in my bank. I dont touch him, he doesnt touch me. Im perfectly content with inhabiting pure blackness once the chemical reactions cease."

I know that the only thing the UC system really cares that much about is bad press, and I've had enough bad experiences with parking (price, overselling of parking passes, the fact that financial aid doesn't kick in until permits are sold out, blocking out portions of lots for special events, the fact that they make so much money from parking ticket revenues, and the list goes on and on) that I am ready and willing to form some sort of protest/demonstration. If that means setting up a date where as many people as possible email the head of UCI Parking, or contacting a local newspaper like the LA Times, getting ASUCI involved, making a petition, etc., I am willing to do it if other people will get involved with me. I and a lot of other people I know are fed up with all of the problems with UCI parking and I just want something to change, if not for me then for some other fellow broke college students or students in years to follow.

I registered for the orientation June 8th, and at that time the earliest one available is SPOP 6 (April 8th), so I chose that and was reserved, but I did not pay for the it because I also signed up for the summer bridge program and thought that I might get accepted. As July gets closer my parents and I have started to plan out the entire trip to Irvine and bought airplane tickets. July came, and I found out that I got rejected from summer bridge, but I could not figure out how to continue the payment for the orientation. After a long while of searching I finally found that I have to pay for it via a tiny link sent to me by some staff under the section called email history or something in the ""My orientation"" page. This is where the true nightmare starts, as I entered the payment link it led me to a web error page saying ""found 2 active orders when there should be 1"".

I tried to click around but nothing ever happened and logging in and out only leads me back to this page, so I tried contacted the office via the email address, but I did not get any response the second day. When I logged back in the second day, I was shocked to find out that instead of having a ""View SPOP6"" button, it shows ""ENTER"" as if I never was registered.....

At this point I am just really frustrated and quite heartbroken, because this could totally mean that the whole travel plan that we've been planning for months was screwed. So far I tried everything I could to contact UCI Staffs, which include the two email address that have never replied to me ([orientation@uci.edu](mailto:orientation@uci.edu) and [studentlife@uci.edu](mailto:studentlife@uci.edu)), [studentleadership@uci.edu](mailto:studentleadership@uci.edu),  [admissions@uci.edu](mailto:admissions@uci.edu), as well as calling that number given but it only leads me to a voice mail to leave my contact info (which I did leave my contact info). 

Right now I highly doubt that I will get immediate responses from any of the contact methods that I used, so does anyone here know another method to resolve this whole situation, thanks. "

I thought he was really attractive and I really wanted to work up the balls to talk to him. I thought we kinda locked eyes for a sec maybe and it made me kinda hopeful. The whiteboard always had a lot of complex math on it after the class left, I seriously had no idea what was on it so I figured it was an upper div math class. 
The final day of that discussion  I dressed extra cute and told myself I was finally gonna just do it. I didn’t see him that day though and I was bummed. I missed my shot to talk to him and who knows if I’d ever see him again. 
Later that day I tried to look him up or find him on somethin but without even knowing his name I didn’t get shit, duhhh, obviously.
I thought a lot about any sort of info I could grasp. Then I realized I could prbly find what class it was since I knew the day, time, &amp; building. Found the course name, found the TA’s email, n emailed the TA. 
Wtf is wrong with me?!? It was the weirdest email I’ve ever sent and it went somewhere along the lines of “hey I’m kinda into this guy that looks like blah blah blah and I was wondering  if you could tell me his name?”  
Her response was “that’s private information I’m not allowed to release that, but if you want I could give him your number.” I swear when I read that response I had to reread it and reevaluate just what I had gotten myself into and whether I was bold enough to give her my number. Well I already put myself out this far I figured. 
Maybe a day or two later I get a text from him, a super confused text, but a text nonetheless. I couldnt believe I fucking I did it &amp; that it worked. We ended up having a short summer fling. 
Point of the story is shot your shoot, especially girls who think only guys can/should make moves, life’s too short to wonder what if. "

I found this comment from a Professor interesting:

&gt; Also, I’ve noticed a few commenters asking why this guy thought he’d get away with his shit. It’s been my experience over nearly fifteen years of teaching composition that plagiarists really believe they’re cleverer than their reviewers (in my case, their professors) are.
&gt; 
&gt; That may actually be true in some cases; I teach specifically because I want my students to be better than I am. However, on the subject of trying to pass off work that is not theirs as if it were original thought, I’ve yet to meet a kid who’s half as slick as they think they are.
&gt; 
&gt; Case in point: a few years back, I had a student try to pass off a paper for my Intro to Rhet/Comp course. The immediate red flag was that the essay submitted did not fit the assignment at all, followed by the fact that the level of diction in the paper was several orders above the student’s standard work.
&gt; 
&gt; I anticipate improvement in student work over the course of a term, but to go from where this student was to what they turned in would be the functional equivalent of Chris Cillizza suddenly producing viable analytical work.
&gt; 
&gt; So I started digging. Every university I’ve worked with has had access to a program called SafeAssign, which makes the job of ferreting out plagiarism a hell of a lot easier than it used to be; it’s not perfect, but the database is significantly more expansive than some folks seem to believe. It did not, however, contain this paper, so I started looking for matches using the old-school skillset I’d been taught in my under-and-graduate programs.
&gt; 
&gt; Turns out the original work was available online, and had originally been published about five years or so before the student was even born. They’d copied it word-for-word for the most part, changed a little of the phrasing toward the end, and called it a day.
&gt; 
&gt; When I confronted the student with my findings, their first response was, “I don’t know what to say. Those are my words, and my original thoughts.” I showed them the original work, then a comparison breakdown between it and their work, and ended on the fact that 98% of the text matched up.
&gt; 
&gt; Still, they denied it.
&gt; 
&gt; To make an already long story short, the student fought the accusation all the way up to my Division Chair, who promptly laughed said student right out of the office. The really sad part in all of this is that I gave the student the opportunity to re-write the essay (which they did, sort of, in that they changed every third word in the offending draft and then re-submitted it to me, which is not how any of this works), and even after that, I gave them the opportunity to write a completely new piece of work to replace the old one (with a significant penalty to any grade they would have received).
&gt; 
&gt; The point of all of this is that plagiarism, as others have said, is not a mistake. It’s an active choice. And what doesn’t help that active choice is the fact that too many students entering college courses have been told, “Oh, just put it into your own words, and you’ll be fine.”
&gt; 
&gt; That is categorically untrue. Paraphrasing is still plagiarism if it occurs without attribution. Word-for-word copying in plagiarism just means you’re being obvious about it; it’s not the theft of the wording that matters as much as the theft of the idea. Plagiarism is theft of original thought; changing the words around and pretending to have written something new is the same pile of shit with a dab of cologne thrown on top."

I know you've probably heard this countless times as a response to your posts but I feel like we should be more specific in what we mean. Therefore: 

* If you haven't received an assignment email, *be patient*. It will make it to you don't worry! The housing office and your RA has been preparing for your arrival since May! If anything, we've waited longer than you have to find out who you are :) Everyone on the housing team is doing their best for you, we just want to put the extra effort to accommodate everyone and that takes time. Is it annoying? Hell yeah. But we'll get to you in no time.
* If you don't have the community you want, *be patient*. Everyone and their moms wanted Mesa Court. We get it! It's beautiful and newer and doesn't have construction. But having a negative mindset before you've even given your community a chance is unfair both to your community and to yourself. Your experience is what you make of it. Mesa can be a pain for a lot of reasons, as can Campus Village, Middle Earth, Arroyo, etc. No community will be 100% perfect on its own. Because it's about the people that you meet and your attitude. Again, be patient, be open, and you are bound to have a wonderful experience.
* If you don't like the room assignment you have, *be patient.* We will get to you eventually, but remember to **please contact your community directly**. (i.e. mesacourt@uci.edu) Your RA literally had nothing to do with your assignment! So we cannot help you lmao pls don't try :')))))  
* If you're wondering about your theme, *be patient*. It's meant to be a surprise and it rotates every year depending on your RA/CA. It'll be revealed to you once you receive a welcome letter from us, which will probably be happening within the next week or so. That being said, themes are one out of the hundreds of things your RA plans months in advanced. We're just as anxious as you are to have you find out! :) 

Basically we all love you and we've never even met you. The last four to five months have been consumed with the excitement of wanting to meet you and we just want to make your year great. All we ask in return is your patience and open hearts. 

&amp;#x200B;

Cheers,

Given that most CTSA events cost $7 (for music events) or $11 (for plays) (plus a bit if you buy online), paying \~$10/ticket seems to be an awful idea, especially since the number of plays being held this year isn't very large.  The tickets also aren't good for the New Swan Shakespeare Festival shows, which would have made the Pass worth it.  

My source: the CTSA Box Office, which told me explicitly (via email) that the tickets won't work for New Swan and also sent me an internal document - which they asked me not to share! - listing the events the Pass was good for.  And none of those events cost enough to make any level of the Pass worth it.

Oddly, this ""internal document"" listed ""subscriber"" prices for each event - averaging $15.  But as a student, you can't be a subscriber.  And if you were a subscriber, you couldn't get the Pass since it's for *students*.  And if you are a student, no event (that I'm aware of) costs $15.

Maybe I'm missing something, but this just seems like a rip-off.  One certainly would not ""Save BIG TIME with a $50 Pass,"" let alone with the $95 or $175 (maybe marginally with this last one).  I understand that the arts are in desperate straits to survive, but offering this Pass and advertising it as a way to save money is unsettling and reflects poorly not just on the CTSA, but on the university as well.  It's also sketchy that I was sent an internal document and asked not to share it - why wouldn't they want to tell *all* students what events the Pass could be used for?

Basically: don't get the CTSA Student Art Pass.  Save money by just using your passive student discount."

This happens frequently at the intersection of Campus Dr. and Bridge (where Taco Bell is), but I see it at other campus crosswalks as well.

So my comment is just about transferring into a quarter system at a UC from a CC, for one just remember, there is only so much they can make you do in a quarter.

A semester is like 16 weeks, maybe 17. A quarter is 10 weeks and an 11th finals week. So yes it's faster, and in my experience we didn't cover less material necessarily. What is good though is that you are pretty frequently tested because of that, and the info is more fresh. There is only so much you can be expected to learn. Many of my classes were HUGE, like IMAX movie theater huge, hundreds of students so exams were often multiple choice scantron, depending on the subject matter, then again some professors killed their TAs by having us write out essay and short answer on tests and all that crap. That's another new thing, TAs. TAs should be treated with kindness, they have a really hard job and are really just a student like you except a few years down the line and in grad school, they aren't like professors. They have to grade ALL THE WORK, do all their insane classes, their internships, and stay sane, and it's hell I'm sure. Some of them will grade pretty easy, some wont, so a lot of your grading will just vary based on things out of your control like who the TA is and if they had coffee that day, so be nice to them, pitty them, even if they aren't nice, like you wouldn't be nice either, so be cool!

Exams tended to be either spaced out throughout the quarter where you get a ""quiz"" on week 3, a midterm on week 5 a quiz on week 7 and a final on week 10. Some would do it where it was an exam week 3 an exam week 6 and an exam week 10, or something like this. Usually there would be papers we had to write as well, and typically a class would have us write like a few 5 page papers or maybe a 5 page and a 10 page paper.

I know some majors are very different, looking at your engineers and comp sci people, so I was a psychology and social behavior major for what it's worth, and I transferred from my CC as a psychology major there with my AA. I did just as well at UCI as I did at my community college, same exact performance throughout much to my surprise. 

The pace at a UC is fast but really, if you think about it, that's kinda nice, info is more fresh in your head for tests, and if you don't' like a class (this will happen) it's over pretty quick, plus time goes by faster and we get longer breaks I think too. Every few weeks something is due at least, so you get used to that flow and it makes time go by faster.

What helped me most was being organized. What this meant was going over my syllabuses for each class and creating a long to do list of every single assignment or test or whatever and the due date as well as important dates for other school stuff. I would mark the point value of each assignment or test and my grade. For exams I would try and make a few friends in each class, just people sitting near me and ask if they wanted to participate with me on a google document study guide, that way we could divide up the work. You probably wont have time to learn every single little thing or read every single thing. In my experience I only really had time to focus on what I needed to know to get the grade, there wasn't extra time to read every word in every research article or book, but I graduated with almost a 4.0 (one fucking A-) so it served me well. In addition to this I used a week 24 hour schedule and a monthly calendar to plan out my time carefully, give time to study, time to write, etc also time to just fuck off and have fun and unwind. It's about priorities though, and keeping your success at UCI your top priority, then comes the fun and social life aspect when there is extra time, at least that's what I recommend.

I think you will do better than you expect if you consider doing something like what I suggested, because if you do that and you maintain discipline you will succeed for sure. I think school stays just as hard as always because you are more and more skilled as you go. Like if you started at UCI when you started at your CC, you would struggle a lot more than you starting UCI now after completing your AA. It's like me starting grad school now at UCLA, yeah it's a crap load of work and I'm probably going to find it as challenging as day 1 at my CC or day 1 at UCI, but I'm ready for it, that's what UCI taught me, you're ready for UCI if your starting at UCI. It's hard, but it's within your zone of proximal development, and after the first quarter you will be cruising. I had harder classes at my CC and I had some harder classes at UCI, the differences were there, pros and cons to each, I don't think it was a vast difference. Even the pace of the quarter system, you get used to it pretty quick, it's not a big deal.

The other thing to do to prevent wasting time is talk to the academic advising office and get a schedule figured out that will get you through the university on time, be proactive and figure out what classes you need for your degree and your options. Check out rate my professor and find the good professors, check out the previous quarter syllabuses for various professors and get an idea about what their class is like to reduce your anxiety. That's just strategy that will help you to feel like you know where you are going.

If you are interested in grad school, especially if you are interested in mental health or a related field, message me on here and I'll send you info on that. The thing is you will need to start working on that basically right away, and it sounds like a lot but it's really not if you start early and spread out the effort. I could write a ton on grad school but I'll save it for anyone interested.

Again welcome to UCI, it's a beautiful campus, positive atmosphere, great opportunity and congratulations on making it so far, clearly you are headed toward a bright future. 

Zot Zot!

If you're living on campus - you probably will be staying at one of the following communities (unless you're ACC, which I know nothing about). Move-in guides for each respective community are below! 

Move-In Weekend is September 21 - 23. Find Move-In Day scheduling and instructions in your Housing Assignment email (coming early September).

What to Bring - https://housing.uci.edu/movein/What_to_Bring.html

** Some Tips **

* Don't carry too much to college, depending on your setup, you may not have a lot of free space. Your roommates will appreciate if they have some space of their own to store their stuff. 
*Freshmen dorm residents have to leave (unless you have prior arrangements) during the Winter Break. 
* Reach out to your roommates early and get to know each other, find common ground - it'll make things go more smoothly on move-in day. 
* If you forget something, don't fret - all the student housing communities have a Amazon Locker (so you can ship stuff to the locker and have it safely stored until you are able to pick it up at the locker). 
* There is also a mini-Target across from UCI with basic student essentials. 

If you are still looking for housing, join the Housing facebook group where listings are made (by both those offering and those seeking a room) daily:

https://www.facebook.com/groups/424352030950046/

Before you ask a question, make sure to read the move-in guide for your community and use the search function. A lot of what you are wondering about is already answered! 

Hope to see y'all in the Fall! I'll put together a /r/UCI meetup within the first few weeks of the quarter when things settle down!

I made some friends my first year but I can tell we’re definitely drifting apart this year LOL. I’m not into any big subcultures here (gaming, raves, boba (lol), “hypebeasts”, being an academic tryhard, etc). I know lots of people in greek life, and they’re super nice, but I’m not very interested in joining greek life. 

While I do appreciate how unique UCI is socially, I find myself wishing I went to a more “typical, social, party school”, for lack of better words, like SLO, SJSU, or UCSB. Does anyone else feel the same way?

Where they sell those awesome bendy pencils and erasers, triangle shaped highlighters, strawberry scented pens, and books for kids? I remember back in 6th grade, my teacher took the whole class down to the book fair so we can buy the stuff we wanted on the last day of book fair. While the whole class was rushing to get those AMAZING, NEW, INNOVATIVE, EXCITING bendy erasers before they are gone, I was looking around with my only friend in the class (because I already bought them, LOL). Suddenly, the group of girls that has been bullying me since the 4th grade came up to me and one of the girls asked if I have a nickle. She said that she need a nickle to buy stuff totaling $5.05, but she only has five dollars. The cashier lady told her to either borrow from someone, or not buy one of the items. 

&amp;#x200B;

So she asked around until she came to me, with her group of girls. I immediately said ""nope!"" She looked very angry as she points at my coin purse. ""Liar! You have fricken money on you!"" I responded very playfully **""I have quarters, pennies, and dimes. But I don't have nickles!\~""** (I actually didn't have nickles on me at the time, I remembered I spent all my nickles in my previous purchase, so technically I was not lying). She left with her groupies of ""girly girls"" (what we *commoners* call them back in the day), while ranting the b\*\*\*\* word. I was not angry at the backlash, because I was too happy at my ""clever"" comeback. MUAHAHAHA, MY REVENGE PLAN WORKED ..... I guess? In the end, nobody wanted to lend 5 cents to her, neither did anyone in her group. I guess carrying coins was ""uncool"" and ""outdated"" for the cool kids? Who knows. But I do know that the moral of the story is to be nice to people (same old saying, I know, but I got to make this LOOK worthwhile because you already read this far ;\]). Who knows? Maybe the person you chose to be nice to will be the one to give you the nickle you need. "

I know I can park in AR spots after 5pm, but it cannot be in lots that are marked with ""Enforced 24 hours"". Is this statement on the red AR signs that are hanged throughout lots 16 and 12A, or are they listed on the entrance signs to the lots?

Also, I know we can park in other zones in unmarked stalls after 3pm, but can we park in other zone's AR spots after 5pm? Or does AR parking only apply to the zone we purchased the permit for?

Today I called them and the guy didn't even reset the access point and instead told me that there's maintenance in the area and that it should be fixed by 6am.

This last Saturday a disgruntled law school student made some Instagram posts with his gun out saying he was going to teach some people a lesson and that he hated law school. 

The law school students were informed (officially, most of them knew through social media and texts) that Monday, and the schools that share buildings with them (business and education) were either told the next day or not at all. 

None of you were told. As of the law school town hall meeting that was tonight, even the housing community that student lived in isn’t aware. (We assume its a large community, because we were told by a neighbor it has undergrad and graduate students in it?

This isn’t okay, so some of us have come together to make a petition to the school, we’ve already shown it to the law school dean, police chief, detectives, and Vice President of student affairs, but we want everyone to get a chance to sign and leave comments before it goes to the chancellor.

you end up pissing away 1-2 lectures (Yea i added up all the times he was late, told some bullshit story or just went off on a tangent haha) which in hindsight doesn't really matter since he jumps around and makes his class way too cumbersome. 

read the book to pass

 Outright refused to use the projector in a class filled with 100+ until the last week or two of actual class. This isn't the good ol' days anymore -- you can spend a few minutes learning how to set one up and use it to help ALL of your students out. 

No im not too salty about my grade, I'm salty that I had to put in twice the effort as my peers just to receive a lower grade. at public schools, university teachers could give less of a shit about what grade they hand out.  with a teacher like Sorace its too apparent.

&amp;#x200B;

For last month or so, we have been busy at work coding up more awesome features to help you plan for Spring 2019. And this time, we want to do things a little differently. We have an idea, and we want to know how you feel about it before we make it come true!

&amp;#x200B;

On this sub, other platforms, and IRL, we have noticed the common catch phrase that unites all students --- ""hey can you tell me about this class?"" At peak times, the sub becomes flooded with these questions. Posts like these can very helpful as many of us do put in a good effort to give you a candid review. While reddit is anonymous, users are still somewhat bound by the reputation associated with a pseudonym. However, reddit can be highly inefficient. A lot of times, people do not search before asking, and duplicates show up wayyyy too much. And for those answering, it becomes a chore to say the same things over and over again. As a result, users are discouraged from answering.

&amp;#x200B;

Ratemyprofessor(RMP) is also a good place to find info. However, as you might have noticed, it becomes frustrating when too few valid and unbiased reviews are available due to a lack of effective moderation. Since there is not a name attached to these posts, highly polemical reviews written by unnamed strangers are all that is left. But the benefit RMP offers over reddit is its organization. Users can find relevant information concentrated in one place, instead of waddling through lots of posts.

&amp;#x200B;

We believe it is important for students to find good and hopefully objective information about courses beforehand. For one thing, it would help with anxiety, and it would allow students to not waste time on classes not fit with their long-term plans. For another, this is a transparency issue. It makes no sense for students to pick between black boxes for courses. This would also institute some levels of reputational accountability for professors, however miniscule the attempt.

&amp;#x200B;

As such, we are proposing message boards for classes on AntAlmanac. Effectively we want to recreate a reddit-esque platform for every single course offered at UCI. Users can share opinions about certain classes, ask and answer questions, as well as vote on other comments (like for products on Amazon).

&amp;#x200B;

We want to combine the best of both worlds, with strong topical organization and effective democratic moderation of content. There would be a karma points system; by providing valid and well-received responses, users can earn points which are quite dapper in and of themselves, but we might offer karma points as a virtual currency for other goodies or privileged services. 

&amp;#x200B;

For accounts, we are considering an entirely anonymous system of pseudonyms like with Reddit, or we might ask users to sign in through FB or Google. A compromise is also available where users sign in using FB/G but appear only under aliases. In any case, we expect that identifying users by a name or alias (unlike on RMP) should put some form of a reputation at stake.

&amp;#x200B;

So then what do you think? Of course there is not a clear-cut answer, and success will depend on specific implementation. So please tell us if you think such a system would work and/or how you would like such a system to be run!!! Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

Side note, this would be very far off into the future.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

Would you like a place to turn to when you're heading into unknown class territory? A place to discuss which class/prof is better? All in one organized place, with usernames to give legitimacy to each review/post? Please let us know what you think!"

I took psychology classes in my first quarter (fall 2018) as a psychology transfer student at UCI. I had a change of heart (way too late) and took ICS classes every quarter afterwards, hoping to transfer into computer science or computer game science. I submitted a change of major request at the end of fall 2019 after meeting the prerequisite courses and I get hit with: 

&gt; Denied.  Per the UCI Change of Major Requirements page, the unit limit for COM to CGS is 60 units.  With 157.5 units, you are well beyond this unit cap - therefore, we cannot  approve your Change of Major Request.   											 

Considering my circumstances, I expected to not be accepted, but I realize now that I want to pursue a CS-related career. I don't know if I should continue with a B.A. in psych, try to get accepted to another school for CS, or self-study (I don't really feel confident with this one).  I doubt they can do anything, but should I go bug ICS affairs? Their site says they don't see non-ICS majors until after week 2, but I don't want to wait that long to be unable to drop classes that I might not need.

I'm going to talk to counselors in the social sciences first after posting this.

Thank you for reading."

My Gpa is around 3.5 and UCI is my first choice. I originally wanted to be an Aerospace engineering major, but due to work and family issues I wasn’t able to take the remaining 2  physics classes. So I tagged as Economics major because I was going planning to double major or even minor it anyways. It is my third year at community college, and I would want to avoid staying  another year for only  2 classes I need to become an aerospace engineer. So my question was If it would be possible to transfer as an Economics major and take the Physics 7C and 7D(required classes linked)  in the summer and switch into aerospace as those would be the only classes I need.

I was extremely confident that I got at the very least a B on one of my finals in a certain class. Even a C on the final would have moved me up a full letter grade, since the final grade replaces the midterm grade if you did better, but my grade is still exactly the same on canvas. "

Let’s be considerate of our other anteater peers. Don’t hog a whole table, and deny a seat because you don’t want to give up the chair you are putting your dirty shoes on.

I'm a first year electrical engineering student at UCI.  I have a deep passion for building random projects, whether it be for my girlfriend, or just for fun. Since I'm EE(that want's to switch to CE), most of my projects have a strong electrical and programming base. I found a few people in the dorms who do fun projects, but I want to see who else is out there in the world of UCI interested in this kind of thing.   I'm looking mostly for people who have some experience, but more or less is always welcome!

Here are the projects I've made over the last 1.5 years(anything earlier is just a little too embarrassing to show to felling engineering students haha). There's a quite a few( I don't have a life lol) so just glance over them. 

![img](axx8iwj5w6h21 ""(Only look at the present on the left) Technically this present is almost 3 years old but still notable! It's an internet based clock that delivers messages every hour or so.  Wood frame constructed with the help of my family, painted blue on the front.  Uses an ESP8266 micrcontroller with a 5050 timer(interrupts for the animations) and an RTC(since it dosn't really make sense to update the online clock every few seconds, only done during startup and every few hours). Uses i2c for the LCD display on the bottom, and SPI for the red LED matrix on top. "")

![video](gegtxjz8x6h21 ""Floppy disk music. I'll admit I only revised the already created code to fit 9 drives instead of 8. But I acquired 9 floppy disk drives from WeirdStuff Warehouse(closed down, was in Sunnyvale, CA in Sillicon Valley), I wired them up to an Arduino Micro, made some changes to the code on the Arduino and made this thing. Not my best work, but still pretty cool.  Also uses a computer power supply. (Code Credit: https://github.com/SammyIAm/Moppy2) "")

&amp;#x200B;

![img](3gzulu5nz6h21 ""This  is a little box that uses an RFID tag to allow it to open and close. The RFID module is a pn532, with an arduino uno on the inside. Typical WS2812b rgb leds(in this case organized as a ring). Also has a fat  5000mah lion in it because that's all I had to power it."")

![img](ao92y46nz6h21 ""Wasn't a great project but I was bored. Used the RGB  to indicate whether or not the box was unlocked. "")

&amp;#x200B;

This project was pretty fun. It was a present for my girlfriend. It's a heart clock notification system, lamp thingy. It uses a Particle Photon for the mainboard, mfrc522 RFID module for security, multiple relays/solid state relays to control the lamp and beeping feature(has a beeper). a WS2812B rgb LED ring in the center, a SPI based display on the right, and a nextion HMI that is connected via serial. I've never run out of pins before on a project, but I nearly ran out for this one(used up every pin, including the wkp pin). There's other modules(like an accelerometer and gyroscope) in the project, but I've forgotten which ones are which. 

![img](5ielairf37h21 ""the painting process was quite comprehensive. First I applied 3 coats of primer(the PLA really soaked up the paint due) Then another 8 coats of the light blue you see here to really make it pop and last a while. The case is a 14x14in heart that was custom 3D printed by my boss at work. Too much cad work haha. "")

&amp;#x200B;

![img](5l8sz9bt57h21 ""Here is some of the electronics being fitted and tested together. You can see a glimpse of the RFID card module, the particle photon, the SPI LCD, Nextion HMI,  along with the relay that controls the lamp. "")

&amp;#x200B;

![img](4mggls2v57h21 ""You can see the accelerometer and main board here in more detail. I decided to go with screw terminals on this thing so it would be easily up-gradable and repairable. Screw terminals also give it a bit of a sexy appearance."")

 

![video](u6ed649l67h21)

![video](kx4676cl67h21 ""I used three voltage stepdown modules. I used an old printer power supply I had lying around to provide the project with ample wattage. It was 32volts at 4 amps, which is pretty unusable to electronics. I stepped down to 3.3v, 5v(both of which are used for electronics), and 24v(used to power the lamp LEDs on the outside)"")

![video](maf6m0bl67h21 ""This is how the project mostly turned out. Since it's connected to the Particle cloud, I make periodic updates to it(added a valentines day mode! and a christmas mode!) and because of modularity and the screw terminals, I'm not worried at all of it breaking because of how easy it is to repair. "")

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This is another project for my work. I created a prototype board that would read capacitance data from an I2C based chip. I can't really divulge what else this project was for haha, but it was really fun to make! ran on tiny little lipos. 

![img](unspy3kt77h21)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This is the current progress done on my team's ENGR 7B quadcopter project. I'm sure most engineering students know of this class so I won't go into details regarding our objective lol.  We abandoned the use of an Arduino Uno for ""superior"" micro controllers.  I used an ESP32 dual core 240mhz chip along with the latest and greatest Particle Argon for prototyping an developing a nice master/slave interface that would be plenty fast and reliable for controlling WS2812b RGB leds. We eventually switched back to a Photon, but the Argon was a joy to develop on!

 We also want to be able to read the Ultrasonic, accelerometer, gyroscope and servo data, along with ability to push all that data to the cloud to be processed by a python script or something later.

While we are working on the whole project together, I'm mostly focused on making the electronics work. My team mates CADed the 3D printed the arm, and have CADed. 

The project is currently unfinished . 

![img](f1401gs687h21 ""our old development platform before we switched over to our final board and switched to particle photons(mainly because Particle Argons and Borons are beween 6$ and 31$ more expensive than a photon). It was a fun way to try out my new toy haha."")

&amp;#x200B;

![img](sg9n0hhc87h21 ""This is almost completely where we are currently at. We have since then added power leads(not using usb obviously on our Quad), and servos. Our code is basically complete at this point, just waited to be calibrated and completed when we finish the quad copter."")

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This is the final project(and my latest). I had two days until Valentines, and I completed the last of my midterms(RIP my sleep schedule), I needed to make a present for my girlfriend, so I made a tiny version of the big blue heart projects up there. This one has a 2000mah Li-on battery, a particle Boron, and an Adafruit Charlieplex rgb module. It displays messages and tiny bitmaps and mini animations periodically, and displays text messages(using IFTT). It's a keychain that she straps on her backpack. It's kinda cute.  

![img](qa4h9ww1b7h21 ""as you can see, the 3D printer had under extrusion issues, gotta fix the feeder gear and spring. "")

![img](409vg1w1b7h21 ""also need to fix the back because I CADed the holes improperly(oops). "")

![img](nbxn80w1b7h21)

&amp;#x200B;

I hope these projects stand out to you! I've done other things as well, but many of them I don't have pictures of, or never completed.

To those who have been waitlisted, or ultimately denied admission, please do not be deterred. College acceptances are fickle, and are in no way indicative of your academic abilities, or achievements. A little bit of insight behind the acceptances that UCs offer: 

From what we (students, former-students, college admissions counselors) can understand, the UCs strive for *geographic diversity*. To accomplish this, the UCs seem to choose the top x% of students from a wide range of schools, rather than a cumulative top x% of students. As a result, we can see students with superb stats admitted, as well as students with objectively average stats. As long as these students fall into the top x% of their school/city/region, they're in the clear. It's not a perfect process, nor is this a definite assumption. But, if admissions is how it truly seems, the result is students from competitive high schools being wholly disadvantaged, as compared to students from less competitive high schools. 

Competition gets fiercer every year. As a former student, I can assure you, I would have barely scraped by in the admissions process now, if at all. I once let my rejection letters define me, and I advise you not to do the same. Take pride in your accomplishments, and don't let the admissions officers get you down; don't give them that benefit. To those about to zot, we salute you. To those going down a different route, we wish you all the best too. "

Each class will have a number limit of students that can get in (which would &lt; or = the total number of players in the current game). Players have to enroll in the classes they are assigned (as many units as they can) through “WebReg” within a time limit. If a class is already full (i.e. other players enrolled faster than you), you won’t be able to get in. In the end of each game (when the time is called), the player who got the highest units would win. There could be a global leaderboard with all the players ranked by the total units they have gained from all the past games.

A lot has happened, and many of you have talked to us in one form or another. I just wanted to address some issues of general interest, including Paul Revere accuracy, recruiting, and Shasha.

# AntAlmanac Redesign

We have redecorated! If you go on [AntAlmanac.com](https://AntAlmanac.com), you will find a slightly changed color scheme and arrangement. We also made a bunch of small UI changes, to hopefully simplify your experience!

# New Features

In the last month or so, we have also worked to add a number of features you requested. You can now see **finals schedules** in the tabular view, where we have also added more information and functionality. 

&amp;#x200B;

![video](imwzlh73sxk21 ""How to view finals schedule"")

In addition, we have updated the **class location links**! Instead of linking to OIT’s classrooms (which basically describe the classrooms without showing you where it is), we link to the newest interactive campus map! Hopefully this will help you find your classes easier.

Also this might not apply to everyone, but we fixed schedule loading for **cancelled courses**. When loading your schedule, we load the latest data. This means that if there was a change in location/time, you see the latest and changed location/time when you load up the schedule (not the case with antplanner). And when you load up a schedule with a cancelled course, a notification will pop up to let you know that something has gone missing.

# Paul Revere Notifications

Again as many of you kindly pointed out, Paul Revere (PR) was down for about half a day this past Wednesday. There was an ant infestation at Paul’s house, and we had to send in a few anteaters to clear the situation. It turns out that we’ve simply never had this many users on PR before! And as a result, we got a huge ass bill for what we were using on AWS. Yesterday afternoon, we ultimately decided to not rob a bank, and instead to temporarily pause the service so that we can move the service from AWS to Quan’s desktop computer. And now he’s asking me to pay his electricity bill. 

But as of this writing, PR is running smoothly again. We are really sorry about the unplanned service downtime.

&amp;#x200B;

One more thing to clarify with PR: its **accuracy**. Some of you have asked about the accuracy of these notifications; sometimes if you check webSOC almost immediately after you get the email/text, the class you wanted is FULL. We are aware of this issue. In fact, for every notification that Paul sends out, I get a copy of that notification in my inbox so that I can test for quality and be the first to know when poop hits the fan. This means that I click to see how accurate it is as well, and I want to say that for the most part, it is accurate.

But I have noticed the issue discussed above. And quite frankly, we don’t know exactly why that happens. Here are a few guesses:

1. The first one is obviously speed. Between detecting a change (when we scrape webSOC) and sending the notification takes a bit of time (depending on how many classes are in the queue). And then there is the time it takes for that email to reach you.
2. And the next factor, and the more probable reason why this is happening is that people are saving spots for each other. For example, someone with priority registration can sign up for a packed class and save a spot for a friend with a later enrollment window. And if there is no waitlist (as there are none for many ICS classes), they can just set on a certain time, and one can drop the class and the other can immediately sign up. Our bot might have picked up on the moment when the course momentarily becomes open; by the time the message gets to you, it's already too late.
3. Lastly maybe a student drops a class, immediately regrets it and adds back in?

In any case, we are trying our best to try and get these notifications for you. Unfortunately it's simply not a perfect system. Sorry about that. But we will be looking into our codebase to see if there is any way to improve this service.

For the time being, the best thing you can do is simply to keep trying. Use the add-back link we send you (check out beautiful campus pics), and keep waiting. We have heard many success stories before. We just can't promise anything, but from what we have seen, PR has helped to increase your chance of getting in! Thank you for your patience!

# I’m Looking for Shasha

If you are Shasha, we would love to give you a bluebook! However, you’ve indicated that you cannot make it to AppDev Club’s meeting, without leaving a method of contact, and so we have no way of setting up a meeting with you!! Please email us at [AntAlmanac@gmail.com](mailto:AntAlmanac@gmail.com), or PM us, or reach us in some way, so that we can arrange a meeting to get you that bluebook. 

Also some of you have yet to pick up your bluebooks! Please let us know if the times for AppDev Club isn’t the best, and we can set up alternative arrangements!

# Recruitment

Oh yes we’re really tired haha. All of us are full-time students and we can definitely use some more hands on deck. We have been preparing for recruitment and details will be released this coming Sunday. We will need not only programmers but also people with a knack for talking, selling and designing!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, as always, please feel free to reach out! If you want to tell us anything about the redesign and/or new features, we would be very happy to talk! Find us through Reddit, Facebook, Feedback form, email([AntAlmanac@gmail.com](mailto:AntAlmanac@gmail.com)), or Github.  "

*Processing gif f0vp7vj5hdl21...*

Hi everyone, my name is Rango, and I started Poor Peter’s AntAlmanac. 2 years ago, I had the idea to collect enrollment data, and I first did so for W18. Then I realized that UCI is very behind on the way students schedule classes. Many universities have some extremely functional and beautiful systems to help students plan. And what do we have? Antplanner? That doesn’t sound like “*We’re the only UC with a school dedicated to ICS*”.

That was when I decided to build the better antplanner. 

Initially I wanted to do it myself, only to realize that I am not nearly talented enough. So then last summer, I recruited through this community and found the amazing team that I have today. I must say that I was blessed: everyone on the team has been an absolutely indispensable part of what we are today. We look out for each other; we bounce ideas off of each other; we specialize and learn from each other. 

This is why I firmly believe AntAlmanac’s biggest advantage is not any particular feature or design, but **the team**. 

Also fundamental to the AntAlmanac is our belief in **software maintenance**. Good software needs a whole team of people to maintain. Or else it stagnates and falls behind much like antplanner has. The fundamental problem at a college is that people graduate, forget, and move on. But we cannot let that happen to AntAlmanac. 

This is why we are now recruiting. 

We value commitment and hard work over any prior experience. Thus we welcome people of all levels and from all backgrounds. We need people who can code AND people capable of professional outreach and communications with our users (through Reddit, FB, email, Github), with the school (registrar, advisors, PAAs), and our partners (ACM, AppDev, Manifest, Product Club, MadeInUCI). 

If you think you are a good fit for our team and you want to add AntAlmanac to your resume, please fill out this form: [https://goo.gl/forms/iLT19rO1HhbQvBgC2](https://goo.gl/forms/iLT19rO1HhbQvBgC2).

I spoke about this encounter to my friend, and she said she's also run into this same guy at Starbucks on campus and at UTC. He creeps out a lot of girls by staring at them and trying to make conversation with them, so I'm posting this to let other girls know about this guy and to be wary around him. 

I didn't get his real name but we talked for roughly an hour. When I sat next to him I didn't think much of it, but after roughly 20 minutes, he started talking to me about life. At first I thought he was just trying for casual conversation, but I realized that he was assessing me as someone he could potentially give his ""Golden Arrow"" to, which he describes as his ability to be completely loyal, loving, and faithful to his perfect match. He kept saying he had 7 days to do this, but I'm not really sure what that means? I asked, but he wouldn't tell me. 

This guy was talking to me about how he was this amazing writer, a national psychologist and how he's trying to change the world by looking for this perfect girl. He also kept mentioning that there are a lot of people who follow him and keep an eye on him? At one point, he asked me if I was sent to watch him. I asked him to elaborate on this but he didn't give me a clear answer. 

He seems respectful enough to back off if you ask him to, but he definitely will approach you and make you uncomfortable if you talk to him. He gives out these weird note cards that say ""Believe in yourself (name)"" with some quote about beauty on the back, and he kept talking about himself and his dream to meet this perfect girl. What made really uncomfortable was the weird flirty comments he kept making? He said that my hair smelled nice, that I had a cute, pretty face with this ""nerd"" thing going on with my glasses, and making hypothetical scenarios if we were to date. I didn't really know what to say, so I just nodded uncomfortably along. 

Finally the conversation ended and he left, but I didn't feel safe in the Starbucks to study anymore, so I drove home. I called some of my friends to keep me company because I wanted to cry and was kind of traumatized by this situation. I found his Facebook afterwards, and he had wrote a post about our encounter. [This](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1064669350384857&amp;set=a.107644446087357&amp;type=3&amp;theater) is his Facebook page, you can scroll around to have a better visual on this guy, but he's a tall light-skinned guy with a neck tattoo, sleeve tattoos on both arms and has dark hair (I'm actually not too sure if that's the right link, I blocked him and Facebook has a policy on not letting people reblock again until 48 hours. His name is Lotus YogiSurfer Dama if you want to look him up, and he has another Facebook page called Surferr Dama). 

I just want to clarify that I didn't think anything of this guy when I sat down next to him, nor did I think anything of it when he started talking to me. It was around 20-30 minutes into our conversation when I started feeling off about him. I'm not accusing him for assaulting me or harassing me, but I was a bit traumatized after our encounter and apparently, I'm not the only one who's experienced this. I wanted to post this so other girls can be cautious around him if they see him; please be safe out there."

&amp;#x200B;

Just recently I was kicked from the Henry Samueli School of Engineering @ UCI as a first year. I had two consecutive quarters of 1.9 GPAs. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now some people might say ""oh just switch \*insert other major here\*"" but for me, that was impossible. I've been an engineering intern for two years(in high school), I design circuits, and do a lot of embedded development in my free time.  It's simply not in my best interest to switch to another major. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure how many people there are in my situation, but I'd like to explain that the academics weren't my largest challenge. I needed to take on a job to pay for food(I have the 100 swipes dining plan), and I got another engineering internship.  I ended up spending too much of my time on it, and didn't leave enough for school.  Another large issue I have is with my room mate. Now I've been living on couches for the last quarter, and it's mainly because I can't handle my room mate. He leaves food in the room, and it smells so bad, the smell goes into the common suite.  Living on couches has deteriorated my mental state for the last couple of months, and made it very difficult to focus on my studies.   I tried contacting middle earth housing, and I have been recommended to switch rooms, but I love the people in my dorm, and I'm very invested in them, and I haven't been able to find any other rooms in our dorm. 

&amp;#x200B;

These two things are the primary contributors to my academic performance(or lack there of). For those who experience things like this, be proactive, and don't try to fix things during the last segment of the quarter(like me), fix them as soon as they become problems. 

&amp;#x200B;

As of right now, I'm deciding between leaving the school, or becoming undeclared. I personally have no attachment to the school, and don't really care about prestige. But I'm leaving behind friends, a girlfriend, and possibly employment opportunities(it looks bad to potential employers if I left UCI due to academic issues). But as undeclared, I don't have the same access to engineering classes, and I need to maintain a GPA that I'm unsure I can keep up(never been super academic). So I'm in a bit of a dilema.  

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to appeal, but that process only works for 2nd and 3rd years. As of  right now I have no other options. 

&amp;#x200B;

P.S my birthday is tomorrow, and that's also the due date for becoming undeclared, which also kinda sucks. "

I sent my SIR to UCI over Berkeley and UCSB because I got regents, it’s close to home, I like the environment, and I saw myself succeeding academically when I did a campus tour. (plus I saw Cal as a potential risk at my chances for grad school. It’s too competitive for a stellar GPA since there’s serious grade deflation in stem). And I’m happy I chose Irvine in terms of academics, but when I think of these people I’m going to Irvine with from my hs, my excitement to attend in the fall is slowly diminishing. I just wanted to ask any current students or alumni: 

Did you also see a lot of your high school classmates at UCI with you? and if so, was it easy to avoid them? or avoid people you don’t like in general? and are dorms separated by majors?

Well, computers in general are not.

But in the spirit of letting all anteaters enjoy the AntAlmanac equally, we decided to put in the overtime over Spring Break, and we are proud to present you our latest feature: voice control, along with a handy assistant, Zotiana, who is now in the ranks of Siri and Cortana. You no longer need to use your hands! Just use your voice to plan and find your classes!

&amp;#x200B;

It’s easy to use Zotiana. All it takes is 3 simple steps:

1. Go to **AntAlmanac.com** on your mobile devices
2. Give it permission to use your microphone (if no prompt occurs you had already given permission before)
3. And just tell Zotiana what to do and she will do it for you!

For example, you can ask Zotiana:

* Hey Zotiana, could you please search for courses in the COMPSCI department?
* Hey Zotiana, could you please pull up the user, “bluephasebb”?
* Hey Zotiana, where is my next class?
* **Hey Zotiana, is the bus down?**

And there you go! As you look for your Spring quarter classes tomorrow, make sure to pull up AntAlmanac on your phones and ask Zotiana to guide you to your classes! 

*Zotiana’s natural language processing is still in beta and thus, a little busted. Try speeding up or slowing down your speech! And remember to go somewhere quiet and speak loudly.*

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For real now: **AntAlmanac is now mobile friendly!** We have integrated tabs so that you can finally see your course schedules on your phones. Clicking on courses on desktop also no longer deletes them, instead coming up with more info about your classes! Always remember to give us feedback on these new features!

ba06ma,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/ba06ma/joining_a_frat_if_youre_gay/,Joining a frat if you're gay,37,8,2019-04-05 20:16:54,"I was thinking about exploring greek life and seeing if any fraternity is a good fit, but I can't help but wonder if being gay complicates things.

I'm sure that attitudes vary between fraternities and within them, but I can't help but suspect that there's some sort of deeper complication despite the variability.

Thinking out loud for a bit, frats traditionally have an in-group culture that centers heavily on shared traits, namely masculinity and attraction for girls, and there's traditionally been a strong tendency towards hypermasculinity in the form of hazing, drinking, partying etc. with a resulting 'bro' culture wherein bonds are formed over shared exploits, including with girls, and helping one another to make mutual 'conquests'. Traditionally, there's an almost impenetrable heteronormativity that makes a queer frat brother almost categorically out of place.

I'd like to think that homophobia is a worst-case scenario, and I am happy to assume that at UCI, the hypermasculinity in frats is less prevalent, and that most fraternities and most frat brothers are tolerant. 
Even if this assumption is true, though, I wonder if there's a fundamental impossibility for a queer person to fit in with a group that is composed entirely of one's preferred sex, and whose members naturally bond over behaviors that spring from traditional masculinity, an unshared source. I wonder if there is a fundamental social complication in the possibility or fear that one of the frat brothers may be attracted to the others, or more generally that one of the frat brothers is able to be, and whether this erodes the possibility for the social fabric and unity - the defining characteristic of a fraternity - to truly include that person.

I'm aware that this seems to be irrational over-thinking, but it is a genuine concern, and I think that gay men especially tend to become especially sensitive to their relationships with straight guys, for fear of causing discomfort or even being rejected. It seems dramatic, but I think most queer people can attest to it.

What do you think? Are there fraternities that are explicitly or implicitly homophobic? If so, is it a general facet of frat culture? And if not, can queer people fit in meaningfully?

I am still pretty heavily closeted, and I suppose I could rush a fraternity and continue to straight-pass. But it would feel disingenuous and it wouldn't change the discomfort with any 'bro' culture. I'd just like to be able to be open and still enjoy a sense of brotherhood, and I'm not sure if that's possible."

also, it'd be a waste of time. you'd just be pushing school dates further.

Just to note, it could be possible to systematically open up the older dorms this way, but it took me 1.5 hours to create and execute a plan.

Why you might ask I would spend 1.5 hours to do such a thing? My friend was out of the dorm, and I had some of my stuff there, including all my clothes. I asked for his permission and got to crackin. 

Just so people know I don't have any intention to break into the dorms. Its a time consuming task, and can be easily repelled(just cover your handle with duck tape. In all honesty the doors are pretty safe, as other methods didn't work. 

It also only works in dorms with big gap under the bottom.

ASUCI Budget Analysis

I saw the post defending ASUCI and frankly I agree, but lets take a quick look at understanding why people feel this way with a lil quick peek at ASUCI's budget.

# Introduction:

As we all know, ASUCI has come under a lot of flak recently for how they have handled various events. Most notably are the popular events such as Shocktoberfest &amp; Summerlands. 

Allegedly, ASUCI budget is 2.5 million dollars. Annually us students pay $84 in “associated student fee” per school year, feel free to check your zotaccount to confirm. It is also available [here](http://reg.uci.edu/fees/2018-2019/undergrad.html). A more comprehensive breakdown of the fees can also be found [here](http://catalogue.uci.edu/informationforprospectivestudents/expensestuitionandfees/).

The associated student fee is the fee which funds ASUCI. 

* $54 of which goes to the Associated Students Fee - ASUCI
   * $1,350,000 in total
* $30 of which goes to the Associated Students Fee - ASUCI Student Resources &amp; Services.
   * $750,000 in total

Please note these fees are also the same for non-resident students. So worry not non-residents you pay the same!

Let us assume this fee is what funds ASUCI. Let us assume there are also 25,000 undergraduates at UCI. With some basic math, it appears ASUCI’s budget is 2.1 million dollars (84\*25000 = 2,100,000). 

Furthemore, it is important to understand the Budget Transparency Act ASUCI’s senate was looking to pass was failed.

# Budget Breakdown Via Office:

Now it is safe to assume ASUCI’s operating budget is approximately $2,100,000. Let us breakdown how this budget is allocated according to the [budget](https://www.asuci.uci.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/fy18-19-budget.pdf).

1. Office of the President:
   1. Total Expenses: 101,552.00
   2. Net Income: -99,052.00
2. Office of the Executive Vice President
   1. Total Expenses: 237,424.00
   2. Net Income: -237,424.00
3. Office of Academic Affairs
   1. Total Expenses: 91,367.00
   2. Net Income: -91,367.00
4. Office of Admin Affairs:
   1. Total Expense: 79,579.00
   2. Net income: -79,579.00
5. Office of the Vice President, Student Services Budget:
   1. Incoming/Profit (Ticket sales): 171,000
   2. Total Expense: 660,393.00
   3. Net Income: -489,393.00
6. Judicial Board:
   1. Total Expense: 7,202.00
   2. Net Income: -7,202.00
7. Student Advocacy General Budget:
   1. Total Expense: 6,372.00
   2. Net Income: -6,372.00
8. Senate Budget:
   1. Total Expense: 30,253.00
   2. Net income: -30,253.00
9. Elections Budget:
   1. Total Expense: 9,570.00
   2. Net income: -9,570.00

In sum, ASUCI spent $1,050,212.00 according to their budget. So. Where is the other half of our “student fees” going to. Before you say the ARC &amp; Student Center, we pay separate fees for those. (2.2mil for the ARC in case you were curious)

Now let us take a closer look at the 3 big spenders:

* Student Services: 
   * \~46.60% of the total budget.
* Vice President:
   * \~22.61% of the total budget.
* President:
   * \~9.43% of the total budget

In total approximately 78.64% of what ASUCI is spending is from these three offices.  Or approximately 39.33% of the $2,100,000 us as undergraduates are giving ASUCI from our student services fee.

Now, let us look more closely at the biggest office’s spending. We will take a look at the breakdown of expenses per office here with some of my comments. Again, feel free to look at the budget for yourself [here](https://www.asuci.uci.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/fy18-19-budget.pdf).

Student Services:

[https://i.imgur.com/N2S28CX.png](https://i.imgur.com/N2S28CX.png)

You may be looking at this and wonder what exactly you are looking at, rest assured I have a vague idea of what we are looking at too. 

Well, the two big spenders here are entertainment and facilities &amp; equipment rental. Now while simply listing the total expense of the category is sufficient for the purposes of ASUCI, it is not sufficient for an actual in-depth analysis. I would like to have seen a breakdown in which the budgetary descriptions are much more comprehensive.  

What are benefits? 

What is the stipend used for? Is this something the office just pockets?

What exactly are the program costs? Why isn’t there a breakdown per program? What constitutes a program?

I understand not everything can be released publicly like how much they spend to book artists and such. But regardless they don’t have to name the artists and can be general.

Remarkably, from ticket sales and advertising they are able to bring in $171,000 in profit. Well done! So there is an additional $171,000 ASUCI is taking from students to fund their events. In total this now brings the total budget to $2,271,000!!!!!! This is basically irrelevant but is interesting to know.

 

# More comprehensive?

Yes! We should be able to see more of where our money is going to specifically for people who are curious. 

For the sake of comparison I am going to use a sister UC, UCLA. How do they show their budget? Well, actually they have a little annual report which breakdowns where the budget is going to, which you can see for yourself [here](https://asucla.ucla.edu/v2/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ASUCLA_2017-18_Annual_Report.pdf). 

For example they have this page, which outlines the highlights of what ASUCLA was able to accomplish:

[https://i.imgur.com/oBkookt.png](https://i.imgur.com/oBkookt.png)

Where is ours ASUCI?

Ready for more?

Let us take a look at ASUCLA’s [own budget report](https://usac.ucla.edu/funding/sga/19-5-13.PDF). Their report is more comprehensive. In fact they breakdown their spending further than just listing the total cost per category. If you would kindly turn to page 244 of the report let us take a look at the budget report of the BioMedical Engineering Society (BMES) of UCLA. 

[https://i.imgur.com/hbgn80m.png](https://i.imgur.com/hbgn80m.png)

Here they breakdown per event where their money goes. In comparison, we do not. They breakdown their budget per event, which helps understand the cost it takes to put on their events. Feel free to look at other examples within the ASUCLA budget.

 

## Final Notes:

So far we have concretely established two things:

1. ASUCI has a budget of approximately $2,100,000 from fees from our tuition.
2. ASUCI in total spent $1,050,212.00 of the budget amongst its offices.

We can also say ASUCI’s budget report is garbage in comparison to that of ASUCLA. Furthermore, there is a lack communication in how the budget helps the community outside of the big events people attends. For example, if we take a look at ASUCLA’s annual report we can see what they have accomplished with bonus statistics of usage and general facts of the programs/events they have implemented. ASUCI's budget report pales in comparison to the report generated by ASUCLA. 

Alright this took me an hour, so it is definitely not something I put 100% of my effort into, hopefully this sparks conversation about the transparency of ASUCI. 

Why did we fail to pass the budget transparency vote?

In general there is a lack of transparency around ASUCI? For instance no where are club budgets and other student organizations mentioned in ASUCI’s own budget. You can even look at SFAC’s own reports [here](https://provost.uci.edu/student-fee-advisory-committee/).

In sum, \~40% of the $2,100,000 we pay ASUCI via our fees is shown in this budget. Maybe the other 60% just vanishes.

bmto55,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/bmto55/a_close_look_at_petrucis_business_plan_yes_they/,"A close look at petr.uci's business plan - Yes, they are profitable",209,44,2019-05-09 21:01:56,"For those of you who might still be out of the loop, petr.uci is the Instagram account for an online store that sells petr stickers, phone cases, mugs, and other merch. It goes against Petr's creator's intentions, in that Petr is supposed to be a wholesome gift to the student body of UCI, and most would agree that this online store is exploiting Petr for a cash grab. However, they constantly deny that they are making a profit and claim that it all goes to operating expenses. I have some ecommerce experience of my own, so I decided to size up their website and figure out the truth. Here are my findings for you all, in the form of a breakdown of their expenses.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hosting and Ecommerce Platform Fees:**  
This essentially boils down to two costs. Using the online tool BuiltWith, we can tell that WooCommerce is the platform that the store is built on. On their website they list the price of their service at [$4 a month](https://imgur.com/a/RtDsErx), which is pretty minimal. The second is what they pay for their domain. Their domain would be a pretty pricey one if it was a .com, but instead it's a .wtf which is pretty cheap. A WHOIS lookup shows Namecheap as the host, which estimates similar domains [at around $5 per year](https://imgur.com/a/aigx1Nj), which was confirmed to be the price by someone who asked petr.uci in a previous post.

This brings total hosting costs to a meager **$4.42 a month**, which essentially covers everything required to keep the store afloat (all the other services listed on BuiltWith were free). As you'll see later, all they'd need to do is sell about 4-5 stickers and they would already break even.  


**Product Costs:**  
Using a reverse image search of their product images I found that they use two services, Printful and Printify, to drop ship their items. For those unfamiliar with drop shipping, it's a hands off approach to stocking an ecommerce website where the storefront serves as a middleman between customers and vendors. No inventory is ever touched by the person operating the store, and everything is shipped directly from the manufacturers. This gives the store owners the advantage of not having to buy any products up front**,** meaning that there is **no startup expense due to buying inventory.** This rules out the possibility of them trying to cover their startup expenses, and the individual product costs can be determined precisely.

Using Printful and Printify to look up the products they are drop shipping, we can estimated the profit for their products. Here are a few examples:

**Phone cases:**

* Petr Undeclared phone case: [$21.40 including shipping on Printify, $25.00 on their site](https://imgur.com/a/93siWpD) = **$3.60 profit**
* Graduation Petr phone case: [$9.16 including shipping on Printify, $16.00 on their site](https://imgur.com/a/MKkbeTG) = **$6.84 profit**

**Sweatshirts:**

* American Petr Hooded Sweatshirt: [$20.75 plus about $5 shipping on Printful, $29.00 on their site](https://imgur.com/a/mu7H0jX) = **$4.25 profit**

**Mugs:**

* Cheerleader Petr Mug: [$13.84 with shipping on Printify, $15.97 on their site](https://imgur.com/a/rvdLJ5P) = **$2.13 profit**

**Stickers:**

Petr.uci actually divulged [what they're paying for stickers](https://imgur.com/a/yiUECjE) on their Instagram story. They claim that the stickers cost $1.58 plus $0.55 each to print and ship, and I found that they [use Printify to source.](https://imgur.com/a/49CncvO) Their pricing of $3 puts them at approximately **$1 profit per sticker** (which they outright said goes to the ""designer's time, website costs, and the time it takes to maintain all of this."" Sounds like profit to me). This obviously adds up over time considering Petr's popularity, and the thousands of people who participate in Petr culture.

Also, bundling shipping into the price of the stickers actually makes it worse for those who order multiple stickers (which I think would be a likely scenario). Shipping costs really only matter for the first sticker, since it essentially weighs nothing and adding another to the shipment would not affect the price. However, since shipping is bundled into the price, they make even more money when multiple Petrs are shipped in the same order since shipping is charged on each sticker regardless.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Despite what they claim, petr.uci is obviously out to make a profit. The numbers are plain and simple, yet they continuously lie about not making any money. Don't let them take advantage of a iconic and fun part of UCI culture, and keep Petr wholesome. Zot zot."

“Can you move?”
Like I never once had a convo w that person. It felt rude to deny moving seats so I had nicely moved because I was asked nicely.
But now I was literally demanded and because I was too tired to move today, 
I nicely said “Sorry, I’d like to be here”. 
But this person literally made a disgusting expression
and said 
“I mean... I always get these seats. Theres so many seats in front of you”
I dont understand. I sat here in this one seat every lecture too because I like the view of the lecture n the seat is located at a nice elevated area.
I dont get it but today I nicely denied it and made it clear that I do not want to move today. 
Later 10min into class I suppose her friend came late. He talked to her friend who asked me earlier,  and comes to me “Can you move one seat”
I kindly said no, and his reaction bothered me because it sorta made me feel like shit because i heard them saying “Why doesnt he move”
Lecture started. Everyone got comfortable in qtheir seats. I dont know what makes them think I should move for them every lecture I attend. I dont know if its because Im just nice but I had to move today again because I was forced into a situation where all I could say is “Sure”.
They had literally put their bags on top of my bag and asked me. And literally started to slide my bag to next desk already while they were asking me to move the 3rd time. Honestly baffled because by the time they asked my stuff had been moved one seat over. 
Honestly what a bitch."

The thing is: I borrowed a tripod and a recorder from the Multimedia resource center(MRC) last Wednesday to finish a group project. 

And the tripod they gave me was a broken one with missing pieces. Since I've never seen or used a tripod before, I couldn't tell that the tripod they gave me missed a part. I knew it was broken until I returned it.

I am very certain that I returned the tripod in the same shape as they gave me. But apparently, the manager won't listen to me, while kept repeating that their staff is very ""experienced"". Well, I am such an unfortunate guy, as always

And as now I have bought a new piece and turned that in (Thanks to the manager for not letting me paying the full bill), I just want to say that everyone who went to any resource center borrowing things should double check the things they gave you. Because apparently, they are not as experienced as they thought they are.

bmudbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/bmudbh/dear_petruci/,Dear Petr.Uci,81,23,2019-05-09 22:23:06,"Literally made a throwaway just to get this point across. To the admin of @petr.uci that insists there is no form of *constructive* criticism thrown your way, let's have a listen as to why the community detests your **business**, yes business, model.

&amp;#x200B;

You and I don't know each other. Clearly, you don't know Petr either, nor do you know what the community stands for, though you act in the name of ""community"". Your idea is flawed. But even more so, we know for a fact you'll still attract clientele and attention because, let's face it, the demand for Petrs without sentiment is the reason you came into business. Your clients will solely consist of people who want Petrs for the material good of it all. You won't get any die-hard Petr followers, though some customers will claim to be. You won't get anyone buying your products in the name of UCI subculture. You're just a shop for stickers. Own up to that, and about 50% of the backlash will be gone.

&amp;#x200B;

Petr itself is a community. A number of students have been with Petr since he started on Reddit, but since his move to Instagram, I can guarantee you that most of the original fans are no longer catching up to his drops. Most of us are stickers behind, and no one is throwing tantrums, because we get it. We **get** what Petr is for. We see the ingenuity and the love put into each riddle, each selfless creation, each number of hours Petr spends in planning, orchestrating, and attending drops. You think those complaining about not having a sticker should be heard? How about Petr? Poor fucker spends his own dime, stays 20-30 minutes after drops to take pictures and sign autographs, and he hides behind a mask. Those who love the community see that. We understand that Petr is not a public good -- some of us won't get the next sticker, and that's fine. It's not about the sticker for us. I have missed the last sticker by a handful of people, and with joy, stayed behind to chat with Petr, because I don't **care**. 

&amp;#x200B;

Your site strips away the care put into each drop. And your customers won't care. You'll get plenty of customers. But if they're happy with poorly-made, mass-distributed Petrs that have no real value to them aside from the measly 3 bucks paid, that's their prerogative. It's just a cheap knockoff. There's no value. So keep selling what you sell. Enjoy the few customers you do get. Just know, if someone feels so entitled to a sticker that they have to buy it to keep up, they probably wouldn't have valued the real Petrs much anyways."

Every time there’s a post that talks bad about uci’s concerts, there’s always people defending it.

I honestly believe our concerts are trash af. Shock is arguably the best concert we have and yet it’s mediocre at best. Other schools such as UCSD and UCR have way better concerts (UCR consistently having great concerts ie spring splash). They have multiple well known artists and it’s an actual concert type of thing unlike shock where you have to sit through watching something before the concert actually begins and we only have 3 artists for that...like seriously? UCR’s concerts are covered by their tuition so it’s literally free for their students to attend but we still have to pay out of pocket at UCI for tickets that are non refundable if the concert is cancelled mid way...why??? If YoU wAnt BeTteR aRtiSts ExPecT TuiTiOn tO go Up. You pay the same amount to go to any UC yet our concerts are still trash and we are still paying money for the tickets to see the artists so something doesn’t add up. And why don’t they release the lineups ahead of times? Bc “it’s a breach of contract”.  literally every other school releases the lineup well ahead of time; it sounds like our concerts are being put together last minute or we need better contract negotiators. Overall I think UCI is a great school but it’s the concerts I have a problem with so don’t tell me to transfer to another school if I don’t like the concerts here...I just think we can do much much MUCH better."

We’d like to announce our release of the iOS version of our mobile application, [ZotTrail](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1464719105?fbclid=IwAR2Nys9RHWSS-7pZMmb1I8OTr3YUbsa_chCNCsgoMaBgydpPPrBOt58aaNw). Features that are useful for the current enrollment period:

* ⚡ Receive blazing fast notifications when a class becomes available.
* 🕑 View course info in real-time.
* 📅 Add classes to weekly schedule.

**Roadmap (in comments)** **and** [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1464719105?fbclid=IwAR2Nys9RHWSS-7pZMmb1I8OTr3YUbsa_chCNCsgoMaBgydpPPrBOt58aaNw)

As a side note, for class notifications, we require students to sign into their UCI email using Google’s secure sign-in. This is so we can restrict the notifications to UCI students only, keeping it fast and fair. Every other feature can be used without signing in. :)

**Future (skip if you only care about the notifications promised in the title)**

We decided to make a small pivot thanks to the user feedback we received. One of our main focuses will now be on integrating UCI resources with the app so that we can make student life easier as well as ease the transition of incoming students. As of now, the app[ displays library times](https://imgur.com/a/0PRSFU5) so student can see if they’re open to study for finals. This feature will be the first of many. We also noticed there weren’t many resources available for students to get engaged with local UCI activities. For this reason, one of our next focuses is to integrate the ARC’s gym times as well as the daily activities going on throughout the day to give exposure to these clubs and events.

While our goal is to make ZotTrail an all-in-one app for UCI students, we will continue to support current features such as courses by adding RateMyProfessor scores and, of course, we’re currently working on allowing users to export their schedule to Google Calendar.

Although we don’t have all of these features in the current release, we wanted to hype them up anyways, because we’ll be working hard to release them ASAP (just needs a little more testing!). We decided to release early for the people who want to take advantage of our notification services. Please go to the website if you want to see our Roadmap (in comments) for future features.

Thank you for reading. Feel free to leave any questions below, or if you have any feedback for the app, use the built-in feedback form."

&amp;#x200B;

finals. i do think there needs to be some way test a students knowledge of the material, but to me a cumulative final seems archaic as fuck. let's say i had two midterms in a course. one at week 4 and one at week 7 or 8. youre telling me I get to AGAIN spend hours studying all of that material all over again, get tested on it AGAIN, on top of having to focus on material covered after the 2nd midterm (which is usually always the more difficult and rushed topics). to me that just seems ridiculous. on top of that...it seems like a game of luck to me. you have to hope the type of problems you studied are similar to what the professor may test on. for final exams, ive often had ones that are just extremely difficult no matter how much you studied. makes you feel like shit when you encounter these type of exams. ALSO, IS THERE NOT SOME THEORETICAL LIMIT ON HOW MUCH INFORMATION A HUMAN BRAIN CAN RETAIN IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME? imagine you finish week 10 and you now have a final monday, tuesday, wednesday, and friday of finals week. I have had this happen to me before and i find it so shitty that not only do you have to balance multiple subjects, you have to cover and review allll of the material of 10 weeks in this short amount of time. how is this fair? is it just me who thinks this way..?"

With that said, I haven’t seen one that goes in depth on how the experience was, so I felt like making one myself. As for why I’m doing this, it’s mainly because I just feel like there were so many horrible things about the course and I want to spread the word and see what others think. 

Now, let me preface this by saying that I am **not** writing this because I failed the class; I actually received an A in this course. That being said, this is not going to be the typical rant post where someone got a horrible grade and they want to rant about the grading. The fact that I am making this post after getting an A just goes to show already how disorganized and horrible this class was in every single aspect. Also, I can confirm that it was not just me who felt this way about the course. Basically everyone I knew felt very similar to how I am feeling here. I just want to share with people who were not in 122B, mainly. As you read, you might think I'm exaggerating sometimes, but I truly am not. I *wish* I was exaggerating; believe me. I can admit that I tend to work slower than others, so maybe other people had a bit of a better time. Nonetheless, let us begin.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TLDR**:
Professor Klefstad was the “Professor” but he did not really...teach. Instead, his undergraduate readers were teaching and grading us (yes, the readers, not the TAs), while Klefstad sat in the front of the room making jokes and asking questions as if he was a student himself. I am convinced that Klefstad actually barely knows anything about this course based on the questions he was asking. It is hysterical that someone so clueless is making a 6 figure salary as a “Professor” while the poor readers are teaching the course, making minimum wage. 

Students like myself who complete assignments on time essentially got punished. If you start an assignment early, you eventually have to redo it because requirements change at the last minute. If you submit on time, chances are the assignment gets postponed. In fact, an entire assignment got canceled (an assignment that I spent an entire weekend on). It was promised that students who completed the HW would get some sort of reward, but it ended up not happening. In fact, worse happened. All students got 5% boost to their grade for just **attempting** the canceled HW. So my weekend of work was for nothing. 

I ended up dropping all of my club and social life activities for this course. I did poorly in ICS 53 for this course. I slept at 6am for 3 weeks straight for this course. I had a maximum of 4 hours of sleep per day for this course.

If you decide to have a plan over a weekend, and I mean any weekend, you are completely screwed because homework assignments are due on weekends and the requirements keep changing until the Sunday due date. You are then graded based on those requirements that were just added on the weekend that the assignment was due. So, if you felt like going to a retreat on a weekend or something, tough luck!

Alright, that is all for the TLDR. I recommend reading below to know the whole experience, if you have some time on your hands. 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For people who are not aware of what this course is, CS 122B is an ICS project course where we build a full stack web application in 10 weeks. This past Spring 2019 was the first time that Professor Klefstad taught the course. For info on Klefstad, he’s infamous for being a funny, entertaining lecturer but not the greatest teacher because he doesn’t really teach in class; rather he gives very basic overviews and then expects us to learn the details on our own. I never had a problem with Klefstad despite his teaching style, so I was optimistic for this course. Boy, was I wrong.

This is how the course was structured: we have to complete a basic version of our app by week 8 to net a max grade of a B- in the class. To get an A, the last 2 weeks are dedicated for “excellence projects” which are basically additional assignments to build up our application. No midterm, no final, no tests. Seems nice and chill, right? Well, keep reading :)

From the first week, the course already felt strange. A typical lecture would be Klefstad giving a very short overview of the day’s content and then he’d bring his TA, Kelly, to teach us (well, he introduced Kelly as a TA, but Kelly is actually an undergraduate reader who’s job is to grade, not teach). So, there’s one problem. Klefstad isn’t even teaching; an undergraduate is. 

Typically, Kelly comes and walks through the day’s learning activity which was always a complete mess because he literally just wants us to type code along with him, and oftentimes the code he had on screen did not even match the code we had because he’d accidentally share us outdated versions. I am not going to blame Kelly too much on this though; the reason why it was such a mess is because the class was being made literally as the quarter went on. The day’s learning activity was made **that day**, usually filled with tons of errors/typos, or being outdated (as I mentioned above). So it was to be expected that we’d have a messy lecture. But this just leads into the grand question; **what is the Klefstad’s role in this class?** After 10 weeks of torture, I still do not know. He did not contribute whatsoever to this course aside from making little jokes in class and giving his little 15 minute overviews. In fact, whenever Kelly came up to teach, Klefstad would sit in the front, asking Kelly questions as if **he** is a student himself, and Kelly would answer and oftentimes laugh or get pissed, and for good reason. It’s just hysterical that Klefstad is so clueless on a course that he is supposed to be **teaching**.

On to homework assignments. We had 1 week to compete each homework assignment. I say 1 week, but in reality, it was like..maybe 3 days, if we’re lucky. This is because despite the homework being released 1 week before it is due, it was **never** finished yet. There were always typos, ambiguities, and contradictions. If you decided to start early like a good student, you would most definitely be wasting your time because 2 days later, the typos and contradictions would be fixed, which would cause you to have to redo several parts of your assignment. Also, the changes made to the homework document were not actually changed... **on the homework document**. Instead, the changes would be posted on Piazza, our class forum. If you decided to not go on Piazza… **you’re screwed**. If you had plans during the weekend...you’re screwed because the homework requirements were always finished around the Friday before the Sunday due date, and the homework is designed to take a week to finish. With that said, I had absolutely no free weekends this whole quarter and I even skipped meals and slept very short hours in order to finish these assignments on time. In fact, sometimes additional requirements would even be posted on the **day the homework is due** and you would lose points if you did not see those requirements.

The reason why having clear requirements is **so** important for this course is because we were graded based off automated tests. If we had any misspellings in our outputs, or just any tiny errors in general, we could potentially lose a ton of points and get an F on the assignment. With poorly written requirements, the homework assignments always had low grade averages after they were tested. Fortunately, the TAs and readers understood that the requirements were too vague, so they allowed us to fix our assignments by providing us the testing scripts. A new due date would be made (usually 1 extra day), and then we could eventually net a 100% on the assignments. The issue with this though is that there is no consistency. A homework assignment could be said to be due Sunday, but then it gets extended due to the requirements being too vague, so then we have to spend even more time fixing our programs to match the very specific automated tests. Then it becomes due like Tuesday or Wednesday, while our next week-long assignment is due the following Sunday. Don’t forget that we also have 2-3 other classes to worry about and life in general. But I guess Klefstad didn’t care about that; in fact Klefstad even GOT ANGRY in class saying things like “in real life jobs, requirements change, even the day before it is due, so these assignments are getting you ready for your future jobs”. Well, Klefstad, 122b is NOT my full time job. It is just 1 course out of my 4 course workload. Not to mention I have a part time job on campus and I **had** many club duties which I had to drop due to this course. But, it’s ok Klefstad, **this is real life,** right?

Now you have some clues on just how crazy the life cycle was for this course. But, believe it or not, it gets **worse**.

The situations I described above for homework was for Hw1-2. Hw3….now that is another beast. So, let us discuss. 

I wasn’t able to start HW3 on Thursday due to my other courses, and I had to fix HW2 due to the poor requirements. As I began working, I soon realized that it was an insanely difficult assignment. It’s a bit hard to go into details without having some heavy CS jargon. Putting it simply, I worked non stop from Friday night - Sunday night, sleeping maybe 5 hours in those 2 days. Fortunately it was extended to Monday, but even then I still worked until 11:55pm Monday night when it was due at 11:59pm. I barely ate anything that day and skipped all of my club meetings. I was absolutely drained, but I got the assignment in on time. 

Next day, it turns out that most of the class could not even get passed the first part of the assignment (there were 6 parts), and Kelly even realized that the assignment was so poorly written and too unfair for us to even do. He admitted that he wrote it a day before it was assigned and he was unable to code it himself to test if it is acceptable to release; he sort of just used his judgement, and unfortunately, the assignment was way too unnecessarily complicated. So, Kelly put a hold on HW3 and said that he will make a new, simpler HW3 for us to do. He said it would be done “soon”, and we would have **3 weeks** to do it so that we can have time to do it alongside HW4 and beyond. He promised at this point that our “old HW3” would count later as credit, so people who finished the assignment could get a reward.

Let’s just say that….this plan did not pull through at all; in fact, everything Kelly mentioned did not even happen. Our new HW3 was not assigned until much much later during the week that we had to do HW6. This week, we had to finish the new HW3 and HW6 by the following Sunday: we had 1 WEEK to do 2 homework assignments. 

I could not start HW3 until Thursday due to my other courses; basically a trend every week. I managed to finish this HW3 by Friday night. But... remember how Kelly said that this HW3 would be easier? It turned out that it not only was almost as hard as the old HW3, but it had even more typos. Lets just say that on Sunday, some people didn’t even start HW6 yet and it was DUE that day. People were still struggling on HW3. But...GET THIS: Kelly THEN mentioned on Piazza around Saturday/Sunday that we should not be focusing on HW3, and instead focus on HW6, and just do HW3….”later”. Cutting to the chase, HW3 ended up not being due until 3 weeks later. LOL! Meanwhile, people were losing sleep trying to do it on this week because Kelly told us in class that we had to do it, but then changed his mind 1 day before the due date HAHAHA. 

So now HW6 is due and finished, well not really. There were some errors involved with the grading causing a lot of people to get unexpected 0s. As this was getting fixed, HW6 was postponed, and then HW7 was assigned. 

So, this is probably a mess for you right now to read, so let me just summarize some things. I spent an entire weekend doing the original HW3, only for it to be canceled. Then I was told to redo HW3 at the same time as doing HW6, but then like a day before the new HW3 due date, I am told that HW3 actually isn’t due, and HW6 should be focused on. I was assuming that HW6 was going to get postponed instead, since you know...6 comes after 3. So I proceed to spend an entire day grinding out HW6, finishing it, only for THAT to get postponed too, eventually to 3 weeks later. 

You’re probably thinking, well I am done with HW3 and HW6, so I am chillin for 3 weeks right? Oh, no no no. That’s funny. There is no CHILL in 122b. 

HW7 had us design an entire frontend for our website. HW2-6 was the backend. I am someone who has never had experience with frontend whatsoever, so a lot of it was jibberish to me. Of course, we barely learned anything related to frontend in class; it’s simply impossible to teach it alongside backend in an adequate way. Frontend should be taught in its own 10 week long course. So, I had to search up tutorials to learn myself. At this point, I was sleeping at 6am every single day in order to deal with this class along with the workload from my other courses, my part time job, and life. My schedule was sleeping at 6am and waking up at 8:40am, always being late to my 9am work shift, and then finishing class at like 8pm to continue the all-night grind again. 

Obviously not only was I overwhelmed, but the whole class too; so much to the point where over 70 students were straight up failing, out of around 150 students. The staff had to make a decision here, and that decision was to allow all students to be able to submit ANY homework assignment by Friday of week 10 and get a chance of full credit. But, this only nets you a max of a B- in the course; you still need to do extra excellence projects too, which were assigned around week 9-10. 

Now, I am going to say this. At this point, I was extremely furious. I felt absolutely cheated. I wasted my entire quarter only to find out that ANYONE could turn in ANY assignment on Friday of week 10 and potentially get a similar grade to me. Not only this, but the original HW3, you know, the one that was supposed to count as an excellence project? It turned out that everyone in the course just got a 5% boost for that. As in, if you just **attempted** the original HW3, you got 5% boost to your grade, as like “part of the curve” as Kelly said. This means that all of the people who actually finished HW3 got no reward. To reiterate, I slept for 5 hours in the span of 2 days and ate basically dirt because I had no time to buy or cook food, so that I could be a *good* student and finish the original HW3 on time. But instead, I got the same credit as someone who gave up on part 1 out of 6. Also, I finished the **new** HW3, HW6, and HW7 all on time as well, but I got no reward for that either because other students could turn in those same assignments weeks after me and get the **same credit**. 

At this point, I was heated. I made a Piazza post addressing this only to get hit with “we will discuss this with the staff”, and then never getting a clear response. Students even tried asking Kelly in class about how unfair the grading is and he just blew up, shouting at us, as if it is our fault. He even raged so hard at one point that he threw his marker on the ground and stomped his feet in rage. Well, I’m sorry Kelly. It’s not like I’m paying money to have a good education or anything. Funny thing is he wants to be a lecturer in the future with that kind of attitude. Good luck with that. Meanwhile Klefstad’s just clueless this whole quarter, unaware of any of this chaos going on. 

The worst part is, there is still so much more to address, so many more horrible things. I wish I was exaggerating, and I wish I was making this up, but I truly am not. The class actually only gets worse from here; I am not joking. At this point I’m just being redundant if I go forward and explain the fiasco with HW7, so I’m just going to skip that. You get the picture. 

Some more things happened on finals week, with students receiving 0s on assignments they spent hours and hours on, etc etc. You get the drill; endless torture.

I was able to get the A in the end...but the experience to get this A...the sacrifice, the tears, the stress, my destroyed mental health, my destroyed physical health (couldn’t go to the gym and ate trash). Only thing I got from this is course is this depressing story to tell. 


**PS:** The one saving grace of this course was Yicong, one of the undergraduate readers. He truly was an amazing part of this course and I surely wouldn’t have been able to get through it without him. I’m too tired right now to give my full thoughts (after writing this novel above), but Yicong truly was a homie. He wrote the automated scripts for grading and was always willing to change them when students found even the tiniest errors. Like he wasn’t even obligated to give us testing scripts; that was a blessing. It sucks that despite this, he was constantly getting people complaining about grades for homework assignments that he didn’t even write. Some dude even trash talked him on Piazza... wtf man. Trash talk Klefstad, not Yicong, the one man who saved this course. Sigh. This class gives me a headache."

I loved it. The campus was beautiful and I really felt like if I were to become a student at UCI that I would have the opportunity to be truly diverse. I thought UCI was a whole lot nicer than UCD and UCSD. It just hit me when I went on the campus that maybe this was the right school for me.

I was supposed to attend Cal Poly SLO for Fall 2018. I backed out of my admissions during orientation because when I set my things down for my overnight orientation, and took a look at the campus and myself, I cried. I felt like I did not belong and this wasn’t the path for me. My parents took me home immediately telling me that although it is a lost opportunity for me not to attend a 4-year right away, they wanted me to be happy and find a school I really wanted to be at. I felt terrible about myself though. I graduated with the highest honors, and worked so hard in high school. It was so hard to get into the UC system, especially for anything biology related that I only got accepted to all the state schools and privates I applied for, but only UCSC and UCR with honors.

I’ve been working really hard so that I have the ability to get into possibly all the schools I apply for in the UC system, so I at least have more options in case things fall out. I currently have a 4.0 after finishing my first year of community college and I volunteer under a prestigious hospital where I have direct contact with patients. I really, really worked my ass off. 

I’m going to be applying for TAG this Fall and I had a hard time choosing whether I want to TAG UCD or UCI, but after visiting the campus and that they both had a great biology program, I decided that I want to TAG UCI. My tour guides were awesome and although I’m too introverted to show any emotions to people, especially when they made me say “zot zot zot” really loud, I was really emotional inside and found the college I wanted to attend. It was a long journey. I hope my TAG goes through since I’m completing all the requirements. Also the campus and location appealed to me more than the farm life. I’m also from NorCal so I want a change of scenery! 

I did feel a bit left out the group as one of the few transfers touring, but I’m glad I did take the tour.

I do have a few questions (I’m too shy to ask my tour guides). As a transfer, I’m going to have 0 experience with research compared to juniors who are my age and have been at UCI longer and have probably had more opportunities than me. How will this negatively impact me, and will I be able to recover from this delay in experience?

Also, I would love to rush an Asian sorority but I feel like it would be odd since I’m a junior and I think most people who rush are freshmen and sophomores? I’m just going off based what I see on social media. I feel like I won’t be as welcomed or won’t get a bid, but I’d still want to try. Is it possible for a junior to rush and get a bid? I’m also around the same age as the sophomores would be, since I was born a little later in the year but made the cut off.

If anyone can also tell me about their experience in the school of Biological sciences, please let me know! I would love to gain some perspective from students who are there. Anything I should know and any tips?"

Then some time in winter quarter we got dinner and she literally didn't talk to me for the entire meal. She then suggested how ""privileged"" I am since I don't qualify for FAFSA and don't have to work, but she has no idea about my private finances. Anyway, after that she would always ignore me. Several times I'd say hi and she said nothing. Then for my birthday I brought home a cake (that was very clearly for my birthday) and she still ignored me. I even put a present by her door for her birthday a week later, and she still did nothing. I felt like I was this clingy girl hopelessly pining for some hunky, rude guy or something.

They basically just want a letter from you explaining why you have a poor gpa (along with evidence of these circumstances), and how you are going to improve next quarter or if the circumstances have changed or how you have learned to cope with them. I know this process is super stressful and I would be happy to help anybody that is going through the same situation I did, because nobody should go through this alone and theres always hope to get your financial aid back. If any of you guys want to look at my appeal application just pm me your email and I could send to you along with other useful tips/resources/websites and answer to the best of my ability any questions you have."

I feel that i could do well if I had another opportunity in fall quarter since i started to adjust to UCI in spring quarter. but right now im in a tight spot where im sort of afraid of doing things right now. 

im scared to face my parents to say im going to cc for a year

i dont know what theyll say, and i dont know how ill react

i just know that todays my last day at UCI and i actually started enjoying school this quarter (i had 2 B and 1 A-) and grtting passing grades. i fucked up hard but i dont know what i want to do after this

im pressured n stressed from all this academic and my parents

As a freshman who will most likely be disqualified, what should i do ? I understand applying for cc then readmit to uci is a way but i honestly dont know if i could apply to cc still or if enrollment is closed. 

i just want to stay anteater"

For those who are not familiar with what a Lennon Wall is, it is a form of protest currently used in Hong Kong; serving as a place to leave notes of support, share art, and join in solidarity. We have created our wall in order to show our support for the protests. At our wall you can find information on the movement; such as why it is happening, the demands of the protesters, and general information you should know. We welcome all to come and post on the wall to show their support or to catch up, there are sticky notes provided. All we ask is that things are kept civil and polite because just like the protesters we hope to keep this peaceful.

Now I don’t know what to major in, I don’t know if I’m going to grad school, and I don’t know if I even will get a job. I know it’s only my second year but I just feel so lost..? I found myself not being interested in rlly anything and since I have to declare a major by the end of this school year then that means I have to take the required classes that I plan to major in but I don’t even know what to major in. Anyone else felt like this before and any advice? What steps did you take to find the major you love? If you were behind in units and classes, how did you manage to get through it?

This is for incoming freshmen in general, but a general word of advice to never ever buy books from the uci bookstore unless you literally have no other choice. The textbooks and access codes there are extravagantly marked up to the point where one textbook is basically a month's worth of rent. Instead, look for pdfs and/or other students selling their used books on facebook and other sites for less than half a new book. You will save THOUSANDS over the course of your UCI career by doing this.

A message from Chancellor Howard Gillman
Just in the last nine months I have had occasion to write to you about horrific acts of violence in Pittsburgh, Thousand Oaks, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, and San Diego. There have been many more opportunities to write. Just this year there have been 252 mass shootings in the United States, killing 281 people and wounding 1,025 others. In 32 cases three or more people were killed in a single episode. There is no other country anywhere in the world not at war that regularly suffers in this way.

This morning our community awoke to news of a third mass killing over the past week.

Let me begin by extending to the victims and their families our deepest condolences. To the members of the UCI community: if you need support, please know that UCI has resources for students, faculty and staff. You can get more information at these websites:

Campus Assistance Program for undergraduates and graduate students
Employee Assistance Program for faculty and staff
Also, please know that UCI is committed to keeping our campus safe and has emergency procedures in place for your protection.

We do not yet know whether the killers this past week have been conclusively linked to white nationalist domestic terrorism or whether they merely fall in the category of non-political mass killers of the sort we associate with Las Vegas or Thousand Oaks. Either way, we are not limited to condolences in our response. Let your voice be heard. Consider whether your advocacy or political engagement can help create a future where we do not assume that terrorism, violence, and hatred destroy so many lives. I also call again on our faculty to engage in more research and teaching on these issues, with support from the campus’s Confronting Extremism initiative.

At UCI you are part of a community that celebrates and values the diverse talents, backgrounds and cultures that create the rich mosaic of our country and university. As we confront the darkness let us rededicate ourselves to being a source of enlightenment for our nation and for the world, paving the way toward a more just and peaceful future, where hope trumps despair, understanding subdues ignorance, empathy overrides insensitivity, and respect conquers hate.

Fiat Lux,

Chancellor Howard Gillman

Last week, ZotCurve was released and almost everyone was ecstatic about it, so I wanted to add on to it by creating something else: [Zotisitcs](https://zotistics.pythonanywhere.com/). 

With the inspiration of [ZotCurve](https://zotcurve.github.io/), I made Zotistics to see the grade distributions of instructors, departments, classes, quarters, years, and any combination of them. You can view the grade distribution from Summer 2014 until Spring 2019 (I plan to update this regularly). You can view the grade distribution of one teacher since 2014 with all of their classes combined, or whatever you select. It's possible to view a single class' grade distribution, but you have to be more specific in the search.

Zotistics isn't meant to be like ZotCurve. It's meant to look at the total averages since the first available year, but it can be used like ZotCurve, but it's imo harder. So if you just want to look at a single class, I recommend using ZotCurve.

There are probably still bugs, so if you encounter one, please comment below or pm me so I can fix it.

I work for UCI Transportation. I've been seeing an influx of questions regarding parking at UCI from incoming freshman and transfers so I thought that I'd just make a post to put some of those questions to rest. 

First and foremost, the student Zone permit system is fairly simple, but also comes with some caveats that you should know to maximize your parking experience. 

Firstly, to pick up your student permit (S or P permit) from a UCI Transportation kiosk YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED YOUR STUDENT ID. We need the magnetic strip from your ID card in order to process the permit. We also need your face to be visible on your student ID so that we can make sure that the correct person is picking up the correct permit. We've had issues with look-a-likes stealing other peoples' permits in the past. So if your ID card does not have a distinguishable image of you on it, please bring some other form of ID so that we may cross reference them.

If you do not have your student ID yet, you can also pick up your permit from the second floor of the police department. That is where the UCI Transportation main office is located. Just provide your proof of purchase.

Secondly, over the weekdays, Zone permit holders can only park in unmarked stalls within their designated Zone from the times of 6:00 AM - 3:00 PM. After 3:00 PM you will be able to park in any unmarked stall in any of the Zones. After 5:00 PM, Zone permit holders will be able to park in any AR non-24 hour enforced (AR Reserved), preferred (P Stalls), or unmarked stall (or Compact Stalls) in any Zone.

These restrictions lift during the weekend. During the weekend you can park in any AR non-24 hour enforced, preferred, or unmarked stall in any Zone all day (6:00 AM - 11:59 PM).

Mind you, the Zone permit is not a 24 hour permit. They are only good for 6:00 AM - 11:59 PM but realistically we don't staff any enforcement attendants after 11:59 PM or before 6:00 AM but be wary, there are always exceptions. 

Preferred Zone permit holders cannot park in AR stalls before 5:00 PM either. Preferred can only park in preferred and unmarked stalls before 5:00 PM. Otherwise, the same rules apply as a regular S permit.

Should you lose or forget your Zone permit somewhere, you can pick up a ""Lost/Forgotten Permit"" as a replacement at any UCI Transportation kiosk. You can do this up to 4 times PER YEAR. Not per permit or quarter, but per year. The year resets June 30th. 

Otherwise, if you do not have a Zone permit, we offer a $13 daily general rate (yes the rates went up) for parking that's good from 6:00 AM - 11:59 PM. Hourly parking is $2/hr. If you're in a rush and want to find a parking stall quickly, you can buy an $18 VIP/AR pass that will allow you to park in AR Reserved stalls. If you don't want to pay the full rate, we have Pay-By-Space dispensers in most of the structures that offer $4/hr parking for those who want to park in any numbered stall.

If you don't want to pay $4/hr for parking, DO NOT PARK IN A NUMBERED STALL. Try to find another dispenser that offers $2/hr or one of our kiosks. They'll be able to help you. 

Dispensers take EXACT CHANGE and DO NOT give refunds (the kiosks do not require exact change but also do not give refunds). If you plan on paying with cash, make sure you have the correct amount. It is UCI Transportation policy in general that we do not provide any sort of refund. So if you try asking, we will more than likely deny you one.

General and hourly permits bought from dispensers and kiosks are good for any unmarked stalls across campus. They are not limited to a zone system. After 5:00 PM, they can also park in any AR non-24 hour enforced, preferred or unmarked stall.

Parking in EV stalls at UCI also requires a valid permit. Your car must be charging in those stalls in order to be able to park there and you have a 3 hour limit. After three hours, you must move your vehicle.

ALL PARKING ON THE UCI CAMPUS MUST BE PAID FOR. There are very few days in which there will be complementary parking. If you aren't sure, ask or buy a permit. If you really want to risk your vehicle getting towed, you can park at UTC (University Town Center). They're pretty good with towing though so I don't recomment that.

If you do decide to park overnight, you can buy an $18 overnight pass from a dispenser which will be good for 24 hours from the time of purchase.

Enforcement patrols are constant and random. Do not try to test the system and get away with it. They actually check permits and permit numbers so forging a permit is pretty bad idea (your car WILL get booted if a forged or stolen permit is found). 

Lastly, no, we DO NOT DRIVE THE BUSES. The Anteater Express is a program run by ASUCI, NOT UCI Transportation. If you'd like more information on that, contact the ASUCI help center or visit them at their main office by the Hill. 

I feel like that's most of it. If I left anything out, then please let me know. If you have any questions, please leave them down below. We're also hiring at UCI Transportation as well, so for anyone who wishes to work for a chill job on campus, go ahead and PM me for the details."

Either that or I had to withdraw from UCI, which is fucking stupid. 

Anyway, I worked my ass off during the summer and passed 51B, 51C, and 51LC. (Definitely don't recommend anyone to do it because learning two o.chem courses in five weeks each isn't fun lmao)

My official, passing grades were up on Sept. 19th but by then my classes dropped, including BIO100, a prerequisite to literally all of my upper divs. Basically, I can't finish my degree unless I get the class. The class has no waitlist and it is IMPOSSIBLE to find an open spot. I went to the BioSci counselors yesterday and they were SO HELPFUL when they basically told me to fuck off and keep checking WebReg. 

I get that they can't help every student and that they can't do anything with the WebReg system, but that's literally the last thing I wanted to hear and I'm so fucking tired of dealing with their shit I'm sorry.

d5r48a,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/d5r48a/older_anteaters_do_you_ever_get_kind_of_jealous/,Older Anteaters: Do you ever get kind of jealous of incoming freshmen?,85,27,2019-09-17 19:12:42,"I know this sounds kinda weird, but I started back in 2014 and graduated Fall 2018. I’m back for a graduate program as well. However, I can’t help but feel a little jealous of the newer students and how much better UCI seems than back when I started. Like the housing seems better with the Mesa Towers, the new Middle Earth Towers, and the new Plaza Verde. The dining halls also seem newer and better than when I was a freshmen. Even the new classroom buildings seem kind of lit. UTC also has developed a lot now that there’s target, some clothing stores, and dunkin donuts. Back as a freshmen, it was just a bunch of dance and yoga studios. Hell, I’m also jealous that the new incoming freshmen get to come in knowing that they had a low acceptance rate and that UCI is a “top college” -the acceptance rate back when I was a freshman was nearly 50% and UCI wasn’t even in the top 5 UCs. I feel like a lot of freshmen had UCI as one of their top choices, rather than the “I only came here because I was rejected by UCLA and UC Berekely” conversations I’d always hear. 

I love that I got to see UCI progress to what it is now, and will continue to see it progress as a grad student. However, I can’t help but feel a little jealous of incoming freshmen knowing they’ll probably have a better experience than I had as a freshmen. Does anybody else feel the same way?"
da4f29,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/da4f29/psa_to_uci_bicyclists/,PSA: To UCI bicyclists,84,18,2019-09-27 11:24:58,"This is for everyone who rides a bike around UCI, especially freshmen. Ride in the road, not on the sidewalk.

[Biking on the sidewalks is more dangerous than biking on roads.](https://mobikefed.org/2016/08/bicycling-sidewalks-not-safe-not-recommended) UCI is fairly well set up with bike lanes and similar options so you do not need to and should not be biking on the sidewalk. [So please bike in the road.](http://www.bike.cornell.edu/pdfs/Sidewalk_biking_FAQ.pdf)

I know Irvine drivers are not great, [especially on Campus](https://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/news/tn-dpt-me-uci-bicyclist-20190116-story.html), but if you are smart about when to use crosswalks from the bike lane and you keep an eye on cars, especially ones turning right out of streets, you are safer there than on a sidewalk.

I love biking around UCI and once you bike in the road you will start feeling more comfortable with it. But when I'm driving around and I see a biker in the bike lane cross traffic at a stop sign like a pedestrian, it peeves me. This is how you get hit. Be predictable, act like a vehicle, which you are.

Also quick shout out to everyone: bikers, skateboarders, walkers. Just keep an eye out for each other and you'll avoid accidents. If you're walking with your headphones on and your head down looking at your phone, you're not aware of your surroundings. 

Everyone stay alert, be in the place you belong, and we can keep UCI safe and fun to get around. Have a good year!"

Over two and a half years ago we created the Official r/UCI Discord Server. As the years have gone by many active users have come and gone, but we are always accepting new Anteaters. If you are interested in discussing classes, new, games, anime, or anything else, don't hesitate to join the server!

We are currently looking to start having activity nights. Whether that be games, group watching shows, and potentially meetups! All these events should generally be planned by our Community Organizers.

&amp;nbsp;

Going into each quarter we will post a survey to gauge interest for class channels. Classes with the most interest will get dedicated channels for people to discuss the class. We currently have a form in our #announcements channel if you would like to request a class.

&amp;nbsp;

We are also looking for people who might be interested in helping to organize potential activity nights and a role for potential new moderators (preferably new freshman or sophomores).

Is it worth it?,13,28,2019-09-28 18:12:10,"Newport Coast Pharmacy posted an unpaid internship position on UCI handshake. My friend applied and got the position. It has only been his first week, but all he has been doing is shredding paper, driving the company car to deliver medicine, storing medicine in inventory, and making tea for customers.

I know unpaid internships are generally a bad idea. They’re usually illegal and just a way for the company to get free labor. They also cheapen the market for that field. Why pay to hire a real worker when you can just get unpaid interns? Unpaid internships are only beneficial if you are really learning something. You should have a mentor that is teaching you relevant information that will be useful in your career.

With that being said, my friend says he isn’t learning anything, but he is hoping that if he stays there long enough, they will eventually teach him stuff. He spoke to another ex-intern who worked for a month, and quit because they weren’t learning anything.

My friend has been working 2-4 times a week, 5hr each shift. Not only is he not learning stuff (maybe yet) and not being paid, his grades might suffer at UCI as well.

Has anyone here interned at Newport Coast Pharmacy? I would like to hear your experiences and thoughts. 

If not, any opinion/advice would be appreciated :)"

My problem right now is I can't think of anything that I can add (don't really have anything to add). I'm an incoming freshman (bio), so I can't really speak about classes I'm taking, and don't have any hs extracurriculars I could transfer over for an application. Just based on Handshake I can't answer about half the questions.

Getting extracurriculars is going to be tough for me to do because of my mom's paranoia. I couldn't do any during high school ECs (couldn't stay after school) and currently she'd rather I take the bus home than stay in school 1-2 hours for her to pick me up after work. Personally I'd skip fall ECs anyway so that I can adjust, but, at least for this year, I know there's slim to none I'll be able to do any.

Was hoping to get an summer internship, but seems far fetched atm. For future internships/research/whatever though, what can I do to try to build some experience/skills to put forth? Any advice would be great.

You are basically forced into doing things in order to officially become a member, REMIND me is friendship the thing where you do what you’re told and you obey or where you are allowed to do what you choose, HMM

Friends in frats only stay friends if you choose to stay in the frat, once you leave it’s like over, WOW brotherhood this brotherhood that, oh you don’t like the price of friendship, OK BYEEE

Aren’t the frat friends just glorified drinking buddies, like do y’all actually know how to have fun beyond just alchohol and drugs, or is that not within your capacity

Your self worth is JUDGED, like friends don’t choose each other, friendship happens naturally, but somehow frat friends y’all are chosen based on your self worth and if they don’t like you, it’s kind of like they don’t think you have any worth, like after everything in the end you don’t get chosen, but you had fun with people in the frat, do y’all actually stay friends after the decision I don’t think so

Frats are essentially a gathering of toxic masculinity, OH BRO DUDE, do you see that Alpha Pi gurl, ID DO HER SO HARD, or basically just a bunch of shirtless douche guys laying out thinking they’re so hot

In the end of the day, frat people are not your friends, it’s basically a glorified version of paying for friends, I have no experience but like if you don’t have the rufht look, frats WILL not look your way, I tried approaching a guy from Kappa Sogma and he dead ass turned away cause apparently I’m not FIT enough to be a part of your elitist fake group

“Community Service”: do you honestly think of you DIDNT have to do community service as a Greek organization, Frats would, UMM no they don’t care squat about helping the world, just partying, and I honestly hate the fake love for it by them, do it sincerely or don’t do it at all

Additionally, the “friends” chose you to be their friend, one quick decision change and those buddies of yours, would never exist. I HATE HATE HATE friendships that were created out of decisions rather than the natural, this isn’t a job where your qualifications and experience is looked at, it’s literally a social elitist group.

Frats CREATE problems, because “brotherhood” trumps all rule, even when one of the brothers does something terrible, all the bro’s have to stand by him or else bye bye BEST FRIENDS.

Never join a frat, if you wanna party, do it yourself, if a bunch of glorified douche guys can do it, so can you, it’s just basically drinking and music and good friends those things are easy to get and TRULY you can have a better time around your good friends rather than a bunch of egotistical losers.

For this edition of UCI Test Kitchen, we'll be kicking off the weekend with ice cream sodas, including the beloved root beer float!

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

2-3 scoops of vanilla ice cream (use chocolate for the ice cream soda variant; Honeycakes station)

1/2 glass of root beer (root beer float; any soda fountain with a touchscreen)

1/4 glass sparkling water (ice cream soda; any soda fountain with a touchscreen)

1/4 glass milk (ice cream soda; various)

1/4 glass chocolate milk (ice cream soda; various)

Whipped cream (optional; Second Breakfast station)

&amp;#x200B;

**Steps:**

1a.) If making an ice cream soda, fill the glass about halfway with a mixture of sparkling water, milk, and chocolate milk, then mix until foamy

1b.) If making a root beer float, simply fill a glass halfway with root beer (with an optional added flavor of vanilla)

2.) Carefully transfer the ice cream from the bowl into the glass

3.) Top with whipped cream and any other toppings

&amp;#x200B;

Most everyone has had (and loves) root beer floats, but not as many people know of its lesser tasted version, the chocolate ice cream soda (pictured here). Both have their own signature flavor profile, so try out both with different toppings and soda-to-ice cream ratios and see which one you like best! Enjoy!

So I'm the type that has always struggled with math, and with severe social anxiety its hard for me to make it to lecture. When I do make it to lecture, I often get distracted or cannot keep up with the pace at which Pluta is moving at, and before long, I've already lost as to what's happening. To compensate for that, I've been developing a playlist of Youtube tutorials for Math 2B which has helped me greatly. It has allowed me to digest topics at my pace and able to rewind and see what I got right and wrong has allowed me to process what is needed for me.  Hopefully someone can find my playlist useful, much of the videos are from the Organic Chemistry Tutor. In the future, I will probably make more playlists to help with other classes as well, such as MGMT courses.

DM me if you want to be extra-involved and help run the club, because we definitely need people like you! (also don’t forget to join /r/YangforPresidentHQ)

Never heard of Andrew Yang? Put simply, he’s the Asian man running for president who wants to give every American adult $1000 a month. It sounds almost too good to be true, but it’s surprisingly the best solution to eliminate poverty and prepare Americans for the future as automation &amp; globalization ramp up. He is competing for the Democratic nomination in a highly-contested primary race, and is currently between 4th-6th place depending on what metrics you look at. His 21st-century platform consists of over 100 policies, including:

* The “Freedom Dividend”: universal basic income of $1000/month for every American adult
* Medicare-for-All
* Student loan debt forgiveness
* Federal legalization of marijuana https://twitter.com/AndrewYang/status/1170048318686318593
* Combating climate change
* Giving people property rights over their data
* Reducing cost of higher education
* Eliminating private prisons and reducing mass incarceration
* Much, much more at [https://www.yang2020.com/policies/](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/)

If that piqued your interest, sign up today or stop by the Yang 2020 booth on Ring Road on Thursday, October 17 to find out more. In the meantime, no one can convince you better than Andrew Yang himself, so listen to the first few minutes of his [Joe Rogan appearance](https://youtu.be/cTsEzmFamZ8) and hear why you deserve $1000 a month.

UCI Test Kitchen serves to help that problem,  creating new food ideas with ingredients found throughout the dining  hall stations.

For this edition of UCI Test Kitchen, we'll be showing off one of the fancier (and more complex) sides of what Brandywine has to offer with bruschetta, an Italian *antipasto* traditionally made with marinated tomatoes on grilled bread.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ingredients:**

2-4 slices of tomato (Ember station)

4 tablespoons olive oil (enough to get the tomatoes well coated; Farm Stand station)

2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar (about half the amount of olive oil you used; Farm Stand station)

1 teaspoon salt (just a pinch, various)

1-2 slices of bread (Second Breakfast station)

Cheese (optional topping; Farm Stand station)

&amp;#x200B;

**Steps:**

1.) Set your bread slice(s) to toast at the Second Breakfast station

2.) While the bread is toasting, pour the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and salt on top of the tomatoes in a bowl

3.) Slices up the tomatoes into very small cubes (this can be tricky, you can instead slices the tomatoes on a plate and then pour them into the oil-vinegar marinade, or just use already diced tomatoes if another station is serving them)

4.) Grab your toast, then pour a \*very\* small amount of olive oil on the toast and spread it

5.) Cut the toast in half, then ladle the marinated tomatoes onto the toast with a fork (this is to prevent too much marinade getting onto the toast and making it soggy)

6.) Top with shredded cheese if desired (white cheeses like parmesan works best\*)

&amp;#x200B;

While not being a true representation of bruschetta, with the lack of garlic and basil, the taste is amazing. This food may be new or unusual to some, but the cooking process is worth it for its deliciously acidic, salty, and summery flavor. Enjoy!

ddd5j5,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/ddd5j5/business_economics_faq/,Business Economics FAQ,28,7,2019-10-04 13:38:10,"Hey everyone!

We're the Undergraduate Business Association, a general business club open to all majors. Lately we've received a lot of questions about business econ, and seen quite a few on this sub too. We decided to compile some of the most frequently asked questions for future reference, since it can be surprisingly difficult to get a thorough answer for some of these. Let's get into it:

**What is the difference between business admin and business econ?**

Business econ (BE) has a much higher emphasis on economics than business admin (BA), and can generally be described as straight economics with a couple business topics mixed in. The BE coursework is about 75% econ and 25% business, while obviously the BA requirements are pretty much exclusively business courses. BE is slightly more math heavy and the general consensus is that it can be a little bit harder than BA, but it's still not too bad for most people. Also, BE is **not** technically part of the business school, and actually falls under the school of social sciences (important for major restrictions and academic advising).

**Should I transfer into business econ or business admin?**

BA is usually everyone's first choice, while BE is the backup. However, less than 10 people per *year* successfully transfer into BA, while BE is relatively easy to get. It is worth noting though that yes, **BE is a valid alternative for BA**, even if it is significantly different. We'll get into that in the next question.

**Does being a business econ major instead of a business admin major affect my career choices?**

For the most part, no. Job outcomes are about the same, most employers don't know the difference between the two majors or don't really care either way. You might get asked why you didn't ""choose"" business admin (even though that's usually everyone's first choice), but as long as you give a good answer about how you really enjoy the econ side of the business world you'll do fine. Either way though, internships are really important as both BA and BE majors in order to start a successful career after college.

**Will I still be able to network as a business econ major?**

Yes. You'll still be welcome in most if not all of the business organizations on campus, which is a great way to network and experience more about what the business world is. 

**Should I get a Merage school minor as a business econ major? I.e. management, accounting, or entrepreneurship**

It's a good idea. What most people don't know is that you don't actually have to apply for the minor in order to graduate with it; if you took the required classes then you get it regardless. Most of the time there are still some spots open when major restrictions lift on a business school class (also, upper div management courses that are online do not have major restrictions to begin with), so it's entirely possible to do. There's a lot of overlap in BE and BA minor classes as well, just make sure to take the business versions of courses whenever you can since often they fill requirements for both BE and the business minors (for example, MGMT 30A fills the accounting requirement for both while the econ version does not)

Because even though there should be a division of power between judicial, senate, executive and SAG something, they are all buddy-buddy and waste 2 something million dollars. I am kind of tired of seeing abuse of power. They are not even transparent and do not post meeting minutes for anything except senate (which honestly even those minites are useless how they are written). As someone in asuci, i am tired of people not doing work in positions for power and getting paid $8000+ from student money. Also maybe we can all run an anti-ASUCI referendum in spring elections so asuci would not have any funding (it is completely legal, so....)"
dqg99i,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/dqg99i/commuter_lounge_survey/,COMMUTER LOUNGE &amp; SURVEY,59,3,2019-11-01 22:49:28,"Hihi Commuter Friends :)

The Commuter Success Commission is going to be presenting an advocacy project of sorts soon. UCI has a reputation of being a ""commuter school"" yet it lacks the appropriate resources and community for commuters to thrive. We're hoping to get input and support from our fellow commuters on the idea of a Commuter Lounge. Our focus this year will be on curating this space and serving the commuter community.  We see a need for a resource like this for commuters to be able to store their belongs (commuter locker system), store their food (refrigerator check-in system-- cause no one wants to eat out multiple meals a day), bond with other commuters in a common area, etc.

UCSD already has a similar system of 7 commuter lounges with various amenities. We're trying to emulate this system in hopes that we can better support the Anteater community. 

If y'all could fill out this short survey, it'd really help us. 

I, myself, am a shy and quiet anteater just trying to get by and would have really loved having more commuter resources as a freshman. So, to all of you fellow shy anteaters, this is an opportunity for your voice to be heard. Also feel free to let us know what other things you think we can do to help improve your experience here at UCI. And if this is something you think UCI really needs, please share it with all of your commuter buddies &lt;3  Thank you so much for reading this far and good luck for the reminder of your midterms season!

**SURVEY LINK:** [**https://forms.gle/4onpvQyZHwmBhgjd7**](https://forms.gle/4onpvQyZHwmBhgjd7?fbclid=IwAR06dg8JR0ttywU-M5J1yxKiVLwJuIWjj_pn2cXb0fm5pqlF_oq6Nkt05dA) 

\[Note: The cutoff date for this survey will be Nov. 8th at 11:59PM as will be presenting our proposal Nov. 9th\]"

It’s 1am in the morning as I am writing post because I’ve been so stressed out and sad ever since I turned in my UC applications. I am a third year CC student and I applied to UCI, majoring in Biomedical Engineering so I just want to ask for advices/tips as well as the chance of me getting accepted. I currently have a UC transferable GPA of 3.49 so I think Im qualified for TAG? I also was an engineering intern at a medical company so i don’t know if that will increase my chance of getting accepted or not. The main reason why I’m stressed out is because I heard BME is quite competitive and Im fear for my life that my GPA will drop below a 3.4 (bc of physics and calc) by spring quarter. Another thing is that I have like 125 quarter units so I don’t know if that will ruin my chance or not.

I have some questions and some worries,198,101,2020-01-02 12:32:31,"Like the title says, I'm going to try to make a petition. With the power of the Internet, I'm sure that it can be spread very far. I'm not against professors giving students the option to purchase these programs and newest edition textbooks, but I am against forcing every single student in a class to pay 80-135 dollars to buy the newest edition textbooks that are 99% similar to their previous editions and programs like Connect that are not so useful that it warrants every single student to use it. I posted something yesterday so you can see the full details of what I'm trying to say and examples as well. I think I did pretty alright in trying to explain my case.

Now here is the problem. Schools rarely listen to their students. For example, the lack of labs or writing classes have been plaguing this school for a very long time with students complaining about it numerous times for numerous years. However, UCI can't get it fixed nor do they put in a lot of effort in trying to fix it. I'm sure that the united voice of thousands of students or even tens of thousands of students can make a difference, but I still have my worries.

I also have a question as to who I should be sending this petition to if we get enough signatures. Which office is the best office to send this to? Since this is a concern for every major not just a couple of specific ones, I am a bit stuck on this one. Should I send it to every dean for every school here? Is there a specific office that deals with textbook requirements?

Thank you for answering and/or just reading this. I will make a separate post when I finish making the petition. Be sure to sign it if you agree with my message!

The issue is not classes I’m doing way better than I thought but it’s just the social aspect of it all. I spend most days not even saying a word to people, my hall is so nice yet it’s gotten to the point where I feel so out of place or left out. I haven’t made any real friends and the expectations I had of college being fun and all that have let me down so bad. I see my roommates having fun and going out and all and it’s good to see that but I sometimes think about me and why I’m not like that and it baffles me. I could be pretty social it’s just that every time I get put into a new environment my bubble thickens and it takes so much time to pop. 

On top of that, I feel so out of place whenever I do the thing I mostly love, playing video games. I’m the only one in my dorm doing that while everyone else is studying and it just feels so wrong. I try to be as quiet as possible of course and I try to avoid playing video games for their sake but come on with no friends or anything to do? It gets soo boring it honestly drives me insane I feel like I’ve lost social braincells because of that. I forget to interact or even appear slightly interesting because of how dull my days are. 

I tried joining a club of my interest which is law and you had to pay to get in and I’ve never paid for a club and I just didn’t like the sound of that so I just didn’t even try. I tried joining this other club Helping Hearts or something and I checked their instagram out and I couldn’t even find a clear way to join so I just gave up. Then midterms and finals came in faster than I thought and I got caught up with studying as well as working for the Anteatery. 

I don’t know it just sucks and I’ve noticed this school neglects anything that is not CSI or all that bullshit. As a poli sci major I feel so out of place and it’s just so lame. Im going back tomorrow and I’m just so nervous and feeling out of it knowing I have to go through that again. 

I’m from Compton, CA and I miss my friends and the ghetto I feel like at this rate Ima end up hating my time there and sure i’ll try to get some clubs or something but I don’t know. To be honest is it just me or does it feel so weird when sometimes people act so nice out of no where? Like it just feels so fake, I guess im used to a different environment and because of that I feel so lost and out of place. Im just trying to get by this shitty school doing as Im told and living by the book. 

Anyways, that was my rant."

I went to try to take a Chinese Quiz at the designated location by my instructor. Upon arriving, I knocked on the door of the room where the test was to be held. It took multiple knocks before finally the door was unlocked by a student and I was let in. I quickly take a look at my surroundings and realize this isn't my class. Before I could move the ""instructor""(White Man) runs up to me and grabs me at the shoulder. I politely brush it off and tell him ""Not to touch me"". He then rudely asks something along the lines of ""What the f\*\*\* are you doing here"", I ask him politely if this was Chinese class or if he could direct me to the appropriate location. He says something along the lines of ""No, leave, get out Chink, are you blind?"". At this point, I'm pretty offended, but I restrain myself. I simply say ""Alright"" and as I leave, he says something like ""Wait, I got your Chinese Class right here"" he then points to a dark empty corner of the ground far away from him and says ""Go"". I remain silent and head towards the door and he yells from ""If you come in here again, I'm calling the cops"". I don't remember if he made any other remarks - a lot of comments about race that were too much to list ""Ching Chong"" and such and talking to me in a belittling, sarcastic manner. Fortunately, I was able to find someone who gave me directions to the appropriate building of my class.

I am a student interested in uci and its business majors, administration and economics, and I have a few questions. How good are the business programs at uci? Are there a lot of career fairs for business students? How are the opportunities for jobs? Is it possible to go into ib from this school? I know that business administration is under Paul Merage, why is business economics under a different school of social sciences? What is the difference between business administration and economics, and which is easier to get in with? Uci is the only uc other than ucb to have business administration so I’m wondering about that. Can anyone in either business major give their experiences about the school or any internships/jobs they have?

Thank you in advance."

So I got my decision back in March 20th that I had been waitlisted to UCI for being a physics major. UCI is without a doubt my dream school and I would absolutely commit there if I got in. I really want to send an email/LOCI but I heard that UCI doesn’t take any new information into consideration unless it is requested. I know I could file an appeal but I’m not sure if the info I can provide is enough to warrant an appeal. Other UC waitlists have the 7000 character box for new information and the option to include a letter of recommendation. What should I do? Any advice is very appreciated

My letter would include getting a 4.3 gpa for my first semester of senior year(my gpa when I submitted my application was lower), I got an A in AP Physics C Mechanics(which would help boost my application for physics), my marching band won regional championships for the 4th year in a row with me as one of the section leaders, I got a new job at a grocery store and I’m the only one in my family working as my mom and sister both lost their jobs in this pandemic."

It is my fault for leaving for home before finals week (just going for it when the situation was evolving was stupid in hindsight because with a new situation like this, the measures will only escalate), but logistically at this point in time I don't think I'll be able to go back to UCI, pack all my stuff, and leave on such short notice.

I want to stay on campus because I can be independent and focus and not stress about moving on short notice/getting rid of lots of things but my parents want me to leave if possible (It'll save on rent, but that comes out of my financial aid anyway). Anyone else put in a situation where they feel like they couldn't really move out?

EDIT: I do know the ACC email said you can cancel your lease up to Friday, March 27 (two days before you have to move out all your stuff). That's a lot better and I have no reason to believe they'll go ""JK if you didn't cancel by March 18 you're shit out of luck). I do know that many people are staying because their home is toxic or even abusive, but that isn't my situation. We don't have room for all my stuff, I don't have my own space, and home is much more stressful compared to being on my own. I guess I do have more time to think, at least."

\*\*I felt like there's a lot of information here so it warrants its own post but I can move it to the Megathread\*\*

1. **FRESH Basic Needs Hub**: In order to be extra cautious during this time, FRESH has decided to implement a temporary procedure to limit potential exposure to germs. We kindly ask that students only come to our space to use the emergency food and toiletry pantry or for their CalFresh appointment and are asking students not to congregate in our space before or after they use the pantry. Because of this, students will be asked to kindly wait outside underneath our rain-proof canopies until a member of our team provides you with an available basket. Thank you so much for understanding these updated procedures and please contact us at [fresh@uci.edu](mailto:fresh@uci.edu) if you have any questions or concerns.
2. **FRESH HUB HOURS (Finals Week &amp; Spring Break)** : 10 AM - 3 PM. ""FRESH will continue to support students during Spring Quarter! We are currently evaluating our options and we will update everyone regarding our Spring services and hours of operation once we coordinate the healthiest and safest procedures. Thank you for understanding!""
3. **Counseling Center**: As of right now the Counseling Center is functioning as normal, but they are also informing students that as information continues to be received it’s possible that their service may be disrupted. They are working hard to make sure that there are contingency plans in place if this should occur!
4. **Parking**: As we anticipate many requests for parking refunds, check our website in the coming days as we evaluate our current processes. If you possess an active permit &amp; wish to have it canceled, please return it to the Transportation office for a prorated refund on unused months, [follow them for more information! They tweeted this earlier](https://twitter.com/UCIParking?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)
5. **Student Center** will still be open 24/7 next week for Finals Week if you are still around and need to study for exams
6. The **ARC** will remain open. They are assessing whether or not to adjust hours for spring quarter, but have no plans at this point. They are in the process of adding this info to their homepage!
7. **UCI E-Sports**: In alignment with the campus' efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19, we are closing the arena to the public beginning today, Wednesday 3/11. We anticipate that we will remain closed through spring quarter and plan on re-opening in the summer. Updates to come
8. Information pertaining to **housing** and next steps will be emailed no later than March 12th

&amp;#x200B;

**MEETING WITH VICE CHANCELLOR AND VCSA STAFF**

1. The ASUCI execs and Vice Chancellor &amp; VCSA staff will be meeting tomorrow morning. If you have any questions concerning spring quarter or other logistics please email them to [internalvp@asuci.uci.edu](mailto:internalvp@asuci.uci.edu). You can also comment them here and I will forward them to her. Some examples questions that have already been asked are:

* ""For international students, we have to take at least 12 units of in-person class for our student visa, since we are changing it to online platform classes. Is it going to affect the status of our visas?""
* ""Will students be able to get reimbursed for certain on-campus fees? (Anteater express fee, student center fee, recreation center fee, etc)""
* ""Will there be any effect on tuition (especially for out of state tuition?""
* ""Will resources on campus still be open (like the shuttle buses?""
* ""Will commencement ceremonies be scheduled for a later time?""
* ""If the classes are online are there going to be scheduled times that we have to log on to canvas or do we just work on our own pace?""
* ""What will the school do to support students that are considered low income/struggle to make ends meet but do not have the ability to break their lease because they found that their current housing situation?""

They seem to be targeting UCI students who are not informed about the current ASUCI situations, and it also is a spread of misinformation to have uninformed voters vote for them. **If your club/organization has received this message, I encourage you to keep reading:**

**Their Platform Relies on the New Constitution (Completely Flawed)**

* If you looked at their platforms, they state that they will dedicate 1/3 of ASUCI's budget towards schools/organizations. However, it states that 60% will go towards clubs/orgs affiliated through an academic unit while 40% goes to executives to distribute to other clubs. Out of 600+ orgs on campus, barely 1/2 are affiliated to an academic unit, which means the distribution of funding is already unequal; there is also no system to ensure that academic unit administrators will distribute the funding equally.
* If the new ASUCI Constitution does not get voted on (which honestly shouldn't), then what are their alternatives to distributing funding to the clubs/organizations? They have not addressed that so far.

**The New Constitution (Which their Platforms Run On) is Completely Undemocratic**

* It makes it difficult for senators to be recalled due to the fact that it is not reflective of the voter turnouts for election. It requires 10% of UCI students to recall a senator (3,000 students), and in some cases like humanities, it will require more students than the number of humanity students to recall their senator. ***Why is it that recalling requires non-humanities students to recall a humanities senator when they aren't allowed to vote for a humanities senator in the first place?***
   * ***Makes it difficult for senators to be recalled:*** [*https://www.newuniversity.org/2020/04/06/the-new-constitution-will-make-it-impossible-to-recall-the-senate-dont-vote-for-it/*](https://www.newuniversity.org/2020/04/06/the-new-constitution-will-make-it-impossible-to-recall-the-senate-dont-vote-for-it/)

   * Removing executive positions for elections; will be appointed. Why is the Student Advocate General, a position that SHOULD be nonpartisan since they are a third-party ensuring that checks and balances are ensured in the student government?

**Fund the Clubs is Ran by RECALLED SENATORS**

* Why trust this slate in the first place if they have been recalled and found guilty of misconduct? Here are the articles to summarize their experiences in senate that have been controversial:

These statements have been made and sourced, and it's important for you all to read them or at least be aware of them.

Chancellor responded to inquires about reducing tuition for spring 2020 by basically saying that although some costs have been reduced others have increased and they will not be reducing out tuition or refunding any fees. I'm not a finacial analyst. But the federal Govt has just given UCI a stimulus package of 39,000,000$ and according to the article below, they are required to give us half of it as emergency aid.

I'm fucking sick about talking about FTC. But they just keep doing stuff, so to any students who have no idea what's going on, I apologize, but I'd strongly encourage you vote so we don't have to deal with people like this anymore.

In [a post](https://old.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/g1jz3a/anybody_else_get_an_email_from_fund_the_clubs/) regarding the email Engineering Senator Bryce Lindsey sent out last night, I saw a lot of comments saying his email is a violation of the ASUCI Elections Code. As much as I'd love for it to be true, the email breaks no elections code rules.

It does however violate another governing document: The ASUCI Code of Ethics. Many people said his email is an abuse of power, and he cannot use his platform to campaign for other candidates. Well, according to **Article 4, Section 5** of the ASUCI Code of Ethics: ""No officer of ASUCI, while acting in their capacity or in the course and scope of their employment, shall use the influence or prestige of their position or title as an employee or officer of ASUCI for or against any candidate for any elected office of ASUCI,"" where an officer is defined as ""...any... elected representative of a constituency as defined by the ASUCI Constitution."" 

The question now becomes: **""Is he campaigning for a candidate for any elected office of ASUCI?""**

I've already heard people argue that his email doesn't explicitly campaign for any candidates. But let's take a closer look at exactly what it is he sent. The final statement in this email is as follows (with bolding/capitalization/spelling copied exactly how he did it, but formatting cleaned up for your sake): ""I encourage you to **Vote Yes** on the **ASUCI Constitution** and for **Candidates who will Fund your Clubs!**

Sure, it is innocent enough. But I'm sure you're all familiar with the slate, **Fund the Clubs.** The same one that has 6 recalled senators on it, a trait they all share with Senator Lindsey. The same slate that has returning members from **Friends of Peter**, the controversial slate from last year that Bryce Lindsey happened to be a part of. The same slate that **made burner accounts to spread libel about their opponents** while consistently harassing those who oppose them.

Reading that last sentence from Bryce's email, you may have noticed the very last part: ""**Fund your Clubs**."" A phrase that is inherently impartial. But look at how it's punctuated and formatted. Both of the words ""Fund"" and ""Clubs"" are capitalized for some reason. I'm sure Bryce is a great guy. A very intelligent man who understands the rules of capitalization. Then again, he can't even format an email correctly. Regardless, you can't have a capitalized word in the middle of a sentence! Not for a common noun like ""clubs!!"" Even ""fund"" is capitalized incorrectly!

Of course, I'm sure Bryce is very familiar with exploiting capital to his advantage.

Surely, Bryce would never do this on accident. Which leaves one option: he capitalized them on purpose. But why? For name recognition, perhaps? Maybe to elicit some subconscious memories an uninformed voter might have about a Facebook post they saw the other day from a candidate running with the slate, Fund the Clubs. I can understand why someone might doubt the extent to which this violates the Code of Ethics. But consider how purposeful everything about it is. He didn't have to capitalize those words, nor bold them. He didn't even have to use the words ""fund"" and ""clubs."" He could've encouraged us to vote for candidates who ""seek to increase the monetary availability of our preferred registered campus organizations."" By encouraging us to vote for these candidates, who intend to ""raise the capital through which a collection of organized students working towards a collective goal can advance towards said goal,"" he's advocated for the people he continues to work with to this day. Using a privately owned mailing list, he's used the privileges of his office to campaign for a candidate (or in this case, 22 candidates) for multiple elected offices of ASUCI, something the ASUCI Code of Ethics prohibits.

While it remains a mystery, one thing is for certain. Bryce Lindsey used those specific words and those specific capital letters deliberately, knowing full well the associations they have to a slate he's got connections with. The phrase is even bolded for God's sake. There is no more subtlety with these people. They are pulling out all the stops because they know the student body is not on their side. I just didn't think they were capable of breaking the rules, especially when most of them have a boot so far down their throat, the soles start to wear out when they sit down.

I don't know much about the rules that he violated regarding Zotmail, so I'll leave those details to someone more informed in the comments.

tl;dr Bryce Lindsey's email is an abuse of power, according to the ASUCI Code of Ethics, considering he 1. used a private privilege of his office to 2. campaign for a slate that he's personally connected to, one that has a history of corruption and misappropriating funds. And section 5 of the Code of Ethics states he's subject to punitive measures."

Then they proceeded to not tell anyone. So ofc the elections comissioner used the old due date when making the website and setting everything up. When the bill was passed everything was already being made (meetings spaces being reserved, websites being worked on, etc). 

Now the Republicans are trying to impeach the comissioner for following the old due dates! Even tho they didn't even notify anyone of the fact that they snuck in language to change the due dates.

The ASUCI judicial board is currently holding a hearing (https://uci.zoom.us/j/94205459430) trying to impeach him. They know they're gonna be voted out so they're trying to deligitamize the elections

As expected, this has resulted in a lot of back and forth with Fund the Clubs becoming very defensive and in some cases spreading false information. [This post](https://old.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/g1cvbd/fund_the_clubs_spreading_misinformation/) does a great job of detailing the stuff that this slate has been promoting. But it goes beyond that.

Fund the Clubs has had to fall back on blatant lying on this platform in attempts to discredit other slates, namely Anteaters United, and they've done so using disgustingly obvious burner accounts.

**First, who has been posting these things?** 

Users u/Book_Knome and u/WestSideFoodCourt have been perpetuating lies about Anteaters United, and it is my understanding that these users are running with Fund the Clubs. u/WestSideFoodCourt posted [this meme](https://imgur.com/a/Z51a253) on r/UCI a day ago, coincidentally the same day the account was made. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/6JpF7an) is the same meme posted by Kevin Tran, a member of Fund the Clubs at the exact same time on Zotmeme.jpg, UCI's Facebook meme page. Obviously, this isn't entirely conclusive, as the meme is inherently impartial and does not take sides in the elections. However, later that day, u/WestSideFoodCourt made [this comment](https://imgur.com/a/2nljfkM) in support of FTC and speaking out against Anteaters United. Circumstantial evidence regarding the times these memes were posted in conjunction with each other points to Fund The Clubs making these burner accounts for this purpose.

**What have they said to slander Anteaters United?**

[This](https://imgur.com/a/LWARrRT) is a screenshot of a comment made by u/WestSideFoodCourt saying Anteaters United is corrupt and ""supported by a recalled ASUCI senator."" I personally find this one really funny, and incredibly embarrassing. **Fund the Clubs**, who u/WestSideFoodCourt has come out in support of in other comments, **actually has 6 members who are currently part of the Senate, and all six of them are part of the 23 senators who were recalled.** So his criticism of AU being ""supported"" by a recalled senator is really fucking hilarious considering he won't apply those same criticisms to the people he supports. I guess, for a recalled senator, just supporting a slate is corrupt, but actually being on one and trying to run again is just fine.

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/vPZeYfu) is a post by u/Book_Knome made yesterday claiming Anteaters United is anti-semitic. This is because AU was endorsed by the club, Students for Justice in Palestine. Obviously, this depends on what side of the argument you fall on, but to be for Palestine is not anti-semitic, it is anti-Zionist. Semitism has become a politicized term to the point that people think it only applies to Jewish people, when a semite is just someone who speaks a Semitic language like Hebrew, Arabic, etc. This is especially funny considering AU has a handful of Arab members. **So not only is calling AU anti-Semitic a lie, it's also completely historically inaccurate.**

tl;dr: In conclusion, members of FTC have been making burner accounts where they can safely spread lies about other slates, calling them anti-semitic and corrupt, when they are the slate run by 6 recalled senators and lying about how they plan to allocate funds to clubs."

The way it is written takes power away from the student body and gives it to the ASUCI Senate. Here's a summary of what I found:

Significant **Changes**:

|*Topic*|*Current Constitution*|*Proposed Constitution*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Recalling Elected Officials|Petition requiring 10% of the votes cast in the previous election (25% needed for Schoolbased Senators)|Petition requiring 10% of ALL UNDERGRADS (over 3,000 students, which is way more than usually vote in elections). The Recall election is then subject to approval by the Senate and a voter turnout of 75% of the previous election. In addition, the recalled senator can run for their seat in this recall election.|
|Starting a Fee Initiative (like the Womxn's Hub Fee)|Petition requiring 8% of the student body (\~2,400 students). It is then put to a vote and requires an affirmative vote of 60%.|Petition requiring 10% of the student body (\~3,000 students). It is then put to a vote and requires an affirmative vote of 66%.|
|Students Proposing/Repealing Legislation|Petition requiring 2% of all undergrads (600). A special election is then called and requires a 5% voter turnout (1,500 students). Additionally, any legislation passed or recalled by students cannot be changed for at least 1 year.|Petition requiring 5% of all undergrads (1,500). A special election is then called and requires 10% voter turnout (3,00 students, which is way more than usually vote in elections). However there is no 1 year restriction like the previous constitution, so any legislation added or repealed can immediately be changed back by the Senate.|

This section is hard to read on mobile, so here's a screenshot: [https://imgur.com/a/KvDeB4A](https://imgur.com/a/KvDeB4A)

**Added** Items:

* Give the Senate the authority to ""create additional procedures to the process of Direct Democracy."" (Article 12 Section 5). This means the Senate can make up their own rules without the student body input to potentially make it harder for students to participate in direct democracy such as proposing fee initiatives/legislation, recalling senators/legislation, etc.
* Added a new Senate seat for ""One Extension Student Senator."" Extension students don't pay student fees to ASUCI, so it doesn't make sense to add this Senate seat.
* Article 9 which requires 1/3 of the ASUCI budget go to student clubs. This comes out to about $750,000. 60% must go to school affiliated clubs, 40% goes to non-school affiliated clubs. This is the addition that the ""Fund the Clubs"" slate always talks about. It seems like this was just a distraction to get all of the other stuff added. There is no reason why this couldn't have just been an amendment added to the current constitution.

**Removed** Items:

* Removed Article 12 Section 5, which requires that ASUCI ""provides an online platform for initiating, signing, distributing, and otherwise administering the petitions"" like [petitions.asuci.uci.edu](https://petitions.asuci.uci.edu/). The new Constitution could let the Senate get rid of this site, making it hard for students to organize and recall senators and legislation.
* Removed the time requirement for initiating a special election of recalled officials. ""Within three days from receiving the signatures, the Elections Commission must validate them and call a special election if the requirements are met."" (Article 12 Section 4E). This means they could potentially delay any recall elections indefinitely.

There's probably more bad stuff that I missed. Feel free correct me on anything I didn't see!

Current Constitution: [https://www.asuci.uci.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/asuci\_constitution\_final.pdf](https://www.asuci.uci.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/asuci_constitution_final.pdf)

*Tldr*: The new Constitution makes it extremely hard for students to recall Senators, initiate/repeal legislation, or start fee initiatives. It allocated $750,000 for clubs, but this appears to be a distraction from all of the other horrible stuff in the Constitution. **Vote NO on the ASUCI Constitution**"

Because you're right. A lot of these people are incompetent. They have no idea what they're doing or what they're getting themselves into when they run.

But the referenda on the ballot are not people. They are real legislations that students can vote on, and you should be using your ability to vote to make a real, tangible difference. There are two major non-representative votes on the ballot.

The Womxn's Hub Resilience Referendum and the ASUCI Constitutional Reform. Even if you don't think ASUCI does anything, these two things are ALREADY on the ballot, and you can and should be voting on them.

You've probably heard this a million times, but the Womxn's Hub Resilience Referendum will charge students $2 a quarter to fund the Womxn's Hub, and 33% of the money raised will go back towards helping students who benefit from financial aid. In order to pass, the referendum needs a steep **20% voter turnout,** and right now we're barely scratching 6%. 

The ASUCI Constitutional Reform only needs **7%** to be considered, and if passed will be one of the biggest disasters in ASUCI history. It will take away student's rights to vote on certain offices and give the Senate an unprecedented amount of power. They also removed the entire section detailing direct democracy, relegating it to an incredibly vague subsection. Don't let them take the power away from the people. Use the power you have while you still have it.

I know ASUCI sucks, and you all want to see it dissolved. But there is change that *you* can make right now. No intervention from ASUCI necessary. Please don't be complacent. You all want to see change. If ASUCI isn't giving it to you, take matters into your own hands. Vote **yes on the Womxn's Hub Referendum** and **no on the ASUCI Constitutional Reform**."

Hey y'all. It's Monday of Week 3, so you can now vote in the ASUCI Elections. You will have until 5pm of this Friday to vote, but I recommend voting soon and spreading the word as much as possible. This election cycle is incredibly important, so please read up on the candidates and decide for yourself who you want to vote for.

In terms of referenda and reforms, vote NO on the ASUCI Constitutional Reform. The senators who drafted this are trying to take away the student's rights to vote on certain offices (like SAG, AAVP, and SSVP), and make it more difficult to get themselves removed from office while giving themselves more power to remove who they want out.

And vote YES on the Womxn's Hub Resilience Referendum. The Womxn's Hub has been on campus for 4 years, and has never had a stable home due to a heavy reliance of temporary funds. More than 80% of the money they receive is not guaranteed for even the next year. The W-Hub is the only major department on campus to not have multiple pro staff, mostly relying on the sole director of the program. The fee, if approved, will charge students $2 a quarter to fund the Womxn's Hub, and 33% of the money raised will be pooled back into financial aid for students who might not be able to afford fees like this.

Many college students are conveniently left out of this aid package among other select groups. Sadly if you are over 18, but also a dependent no stimulus check for you! Not even $500. Boohoo.

Another funny thing is, when filing for financial aid through fafsa you are considered a 
“dependent” if you are one of the following:

- over the age of 24
- married
- have dependents of your own (other than a spouse)
- an orphan
- active duty meme we of the US Military 

Tricky stuff here. Some of the terminology in such applications doesn’t help either. 

How screwed am I? Are we? I lost half of my hours at work because of this pandemic. I still have to pay next months rent. My credit cards are going to max out sooner or later. My parents are broke as sht... also kind of the reason I’ve been sustaining myself. Fun times."

&gt;ASUCI Elections and Engineering Senators' Updates  
Message from Engineering Undergraduate Student Affairs [zotmail@uci.edu](mailto:zotmail@uci.edu)  
Hello all,  
My name is Bryce Lindsey, and I represent engineering students alongside Ryan Salatti in UCI’s student government. Over the last two quarters, we have strived to serve engineering students where they are by supporting their projects, clubs and organizations. In doing so, we [secured](https://zotmail.oit.uci.edu/ClickMessage.aspx?LinkId=2b4589b0-6473-42e4-af32-2761ffafa671&amp;ZotMailId=JOSbu4SGC876L6ecl8PZlQ==):  
**$800,000** to renovate the machine and weld shop as well as improving FABWorks and ET 3rd floor wood tools  
&gt;  
&gt;**$88,200** to renovate and revitalize the Veterans Services Center  
&gt;  
&gt;**$35,000** to Engineering Student Council  
&gt;  
&gt;**$35,000** to the ICS Student Council   
&gt;  
&gt;**$250,000** to support the [Disability Services Center](https://zotmail.oit.uci.edu/ClickMessage.aspx?LinkId=12d177dc-b96f-4d41-a81a-dbfe6bcd4b0d&amp;ZotMailId=loGcum45M5x64Q5W6BZRGg==)  
&gt;  
&gt;We also [revised](https://zotmail.oit.uci.edu/ClickMessage.aspx?LinkId=1e3ae2c2-9bed-40ce-82e9-b2257cd7bcad&amp;ZotMailId=Bj0kQ1PEXTUvYsrBSaiRgA==) The Green Initiative Fund (TGIF) Bylaws to open up **$120,000+ each year** for green related engineering projects.  
To support Engineering Student Organisations (ESO’s) and the Engineering Student Council (ESC) for years to come, we [revised](https://zotmail.oit.uci.edu/ClickMessage.aspx?LinkId=178d2978-e196-452d-8e58-0dfdb597886f&amp;ZotMailId=pSnHmqiRxcpJfQKYAfV1AA==) the ASUCI Constitution and placed it on the ballot for the student body to adopt this week. Most importantly, the new Constitution will **mandate 1/3 of ASUCI funds go to Registered Campus Organizations** (RCO).   
This will secure **$750,000** each year for UCI clubs. The constitution further allocates 60% of this to school-based RCO’s, proportionally by the number of students in each school, and 40% to campus-based RCO’s. With engineering comprising 13.7% of the student body, Engineering Student Organizations and ESC will have **$60,000+** **each year**, as opposed to the current $20,000 available.  
But in order to receive the **$60,000+** **each year** to support engineering student orgs and ESC, the new ASUCI constitution must be adopted by the student body this week.  
Voting is online, April 13-17 at [vote.elections.uci.edu](https://zotmail.oit.uci.edu/ClickMessage.aspx?LinkId=469a26f6-92b2-4db7-be04-282686956415&amp;ZotMailId=IV7ljFY8Sh9tjpT+eT/Cng==)  
I encourage you to **Vote Yes** on the **ASUCI Constitution** and for **Candidates who will Fund your Clubs!**  
With service,  
Bryce Lindsey

Therefore that shit should not even be up for a vote. 

I'm thinking about staging some sort of protest/campaign for defunding ASUCI if it gets approved. The amount of work they do is fucking laughable for the $3 million they get each year, and the new constitution will remove the last bit of power the students currently have."

Each and every petition hit capacity meaning that a special election is in place. The thing is that the ASUCI senate must approve the timeline of the election. Essentially approve their own recall. So far the recall has not been approved yet by the senate and each and every legislation brought up has been stalled and nullified. These people are still getting paid with OUR student fees. I encourage all of you to petition the Judicial board to mandate the special election since it infringes our rights as students if they stall it."

I honestly want to cry. I know if I had an open note test AND 4 hours to complete it, I would be doing a lot better in the class. I think it’s so unfair. At the end of the day regardless of what professor you have, the class is the same. People in that class have a much higher advantage than my class. They have a higher chance of getting a good grade.

I am a Biological Sciences major in my 3rd year at UCI and after much thought I have decided I want to switch to a Computer Science major instead. I have found that I enjoy learning computer science far more than any of the previous subjects I have studied. I am a transfer student and I am currently at the end of my first year at UCI (Spring quarter). I have 138 units completed as of today and I have a \~3.3 gpa. The majority of my past coursework consists of biology, chemistry and some physics classes. I am taking my 1st two ICS courses currently (ICS 31 and ICS 6N in Spring quarter), I have spoken to an ICS counselor and she said it is going to be difficult to change majors. She added that the Bren School of ICS has a 120 unit limit restriction for students who want to switch into Computer Science, this if the excerpt from their website:

“Change of major criteria applies to students with 120 units or less...Students with more than 90 units may not be admitted to the major; they will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis provided they have made substantial progress in courses required for the major.”

Based on my conversation with the counselor, she said that I must first get the 120 unit restriction lifted and then I can submit an application for change of major. I tried submitting a petition for them to lift the restriction before this quarter began and they denied it immediately. After I finish my classes this quarter I plan to submit the petition again to have the restriction lifted (May have a higher chance of being accepted after I have taken the ICS courses). If this is lifted then I will need to take ICS 32 next quarter and submit the application for change of major after that class is completed(That too is not guaranteed to be accepted). 

At this point I am unsure of what to do as it seems I have several different options laid out ahead of me. I am unsure if the restriction will be lifted and if Bren School will accept my change of major request. I do **not** want to graduate with a degree in Biology, Bioinformatics or any related field. The two things I know for sure are that I want to graduate with a degree in Computer Science and that I do not want to waste any more time getting there. I am wondering how I could accomplish this in the **least** amount of time possible. I am open to switching schools (If need be) or also going back to community college to complete the prereq courses I need (Though I am not sure how that would work). What do you guys think about my plan? I would appreciate any help and thanks in advance."

&gt;I am a currently wrapping up my third-year at Saint Louis University SOM and will be applying to diagnostic radiology residency programs later this year. I graduated summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from UCI’s bio sci program in 2017. I had great scores during undergrad, so I did not take a gap year before applying to medical school. Therefore, my extracurriculars were somewhat limited, but I did do a moderate amount of research, shadowing, and volunteering while at UCI.

u/BioSigh

&gt;Hi! My name is Dennis and I'm currently a third year student at the Texas College of Osteopathic Medicine. I was a BioSci UCI alum in 2013 and spent quite a bit of time pursuing research in immunology until I published my paper and realized I wanted to do something else. Currently I'm finishing up my rotations (virtually d/t the pandemic) and preparing for my second set of boards. This past year I was on my institution's Admissions Committee so I might be able to offer some insight on how med school admissions work. I'm also currently applying to Internal Med programs this September!

**(I am still in the process of getting other alumni added to the thread, most people are especially busy with their work hours during this pandemic so please be patient)**

The Zoom Q&amp;A is still occurring for those who are interested, hosted by u/keevesnchives and a few of their classmates. The tentative date for that is currently **April 18th, Saturday at 2PM**. Questions that are longer in length or require more interaction should be reserved for then. Please PM u/keevesnchives for a link to the meeting and if you have any questions.

A few guidelines to follow:

\- Please keep your comments/questions relevant to the topic

\- Please read other comments before posting your own, duplicate questions will be removed

\- **Please be patient for answers as participants have their own outside work/studies/life to consider before taking out time for this thread. Answers may not come in for a few days after posting.**

We are thinking of doing a similar Q&amp;A threads for other popular majors such as CS or Engineering with more past UCI alumni. Let us know if you’re interested in that whether you’re a current student, or an alumnus willing to participate in a Q&amp;A thread.

I'm a third-year community college student and I'm planning to transfer to UCI for the fall, majoring in Biomedical Engineering. UCI sent out the first batch of acceptances yesterday and I did not receive anything so I'm starting to assume the worst-case scenario that I got denied from TAG and was placed in the general admission pool (this might not be true but I'm kind of a pessimist). After winter quarter grades, my UC-Transferable GPA increased to 3.52 from 3.49 (The GPA when I started applying during fall). For my EC's, I was an engineering intern at a small medical company over summer and I also volunteered at food banks. I believe that my UC essays are pretty solid and well-written also. Over the years, I definitely worked hard to improve and there's clearly an upward trend in my grades/GPA which I heard is also a good thing. I checked Transfer by majors and the admit GPA for BME last fall was 3.5-3.81 and I currently have a 3.49\~3.52 which is within the interval. I understand that it gets pretty repetitive when people ask if they have a chance or not but waiting for an answer during this lockdown is pretty tough since there's really nothing for me to do.

With so much going on in the world and for us in the hot spots of the protests such as LA, I just wish professors would be more understanding during this time. Last quarter there was a ton of support to cancel or make finals optional which helped tremendously. This quarter I had a professor who had class on Memorial Day.

A message from Chancellor Howard Gillman

Dear UCI Community,

To paraphrase Winston Churchill, we are nearing the end of the beginning. After an anxious two months of sheltering, our community is eager to fully experience the light of a new day.

At UCI, we’re ready for what’s next. Our Strategic Advisory Group, skillfully led by Interim Provost Hal Stern, has been in place for several weeks, mapping out the details related to our workforce, research, students (current and prospective), instruction (undergraduate and graduate), health (patient and public), technology, and business operations.

Their good work paved the way to a new chapter in the COVID-19 environment. Starting today, we will begin to share our plans for reengaging some campus operations, beginning the careful transition from remote work.

Not all of us will return to the campus at the same time or soon. On-site operations will resume at a gradual pace, with some areas ready for in-person operations before others. Some mission-critical areas that involve discrete locations and smaller numbers of people, such as some lab research, will likely resume first while many others may continue to work remotely for an extended period. We will do this with care, in phases, assessing as we go, building on lessons learned. You will be informed when your unit is prepared to begin a transition phase.

The phase-in decisions are being made with an abundance of thought and planning, with the health of our community at the forefront. Our guiding principles are as follows:

1. **Our primary concern is our people.** Plans and activities will incorporate precautions to help protect the health and safety of our faculty, students, staff, patients, research participants and visitors. We will create a process to accommodate those who believe they cannot return to an in-person work environment.

2. **We will follow public health directives.** This includes guidelines on physical distancing, large-group gatherings, masking, protective equipment and testing, as outlined by federal, state and local governments and our own public health experts.

3. **Transitions will be measured, careful, and flexible.** Decisions will be made based on thorough planning in light of prevailing and anticipated public health guidance, with a commitment to assessing the impact of each new step before proceeding to the next, and with a willingness to retreat to earlier phases if necessary.

4. **We will learn as we proceed and incorporate new techniques and technologies as they become available.** We are already learning lessons from existing campus activities, and new methods and discoveries are emerging rapidly. We will adjust our plans as new testing, tracing and therapies become available.

5. **Our standards of quality will not waver.** Whether our activities are remote or on-site, we will continue to provide a high-quality experience for our students, faculty, staff and community.

As for the fall quarter, here is what we know. Classes will start on schedule. Most classes will be offered remotely, either as the only option or a complement to in-person instruction. We are doing everything possible to prepare classrooms for in-person instruction, but it’s too early to determine which courses will be ready for traditional on-site learning. Deans and department chairs are working with our Office of Teaching and Learning to identify which classes can be prioritized for in-person instruction. It is likely that there will be a higher percentage of in-person graduate classes than undergraduate classes, given the nature of graduate instruction in most disciplines and the apartment-style nature of most on-campus graduate housing. Small studios and labs may be more possible than large lectures. Most importantly, all students enrolled in the fall will be able to begin or continue their courses of study. More information about our plans will be sent to students soon.

And here is what we don’t know about the fall. We’re still working on how many residents we are able to accommodate in student housing, especially in our large undergraduate dorms. We are committed to having as many students on campus as possible, but we need more time and information to plan a re-population of housing. Rooms with three or four residents probably will not be possible, but doubles may be acceptable, depending on dorm policies and safety regulations. We also don’t know how large gatherings – from sporting events and festivals to lectures and symposia – will be structured, but it’s safe to assume we will be following physical distancing protocols throughout the quarter. We are working with outside governing bodies, such as the NCAA and local health agencies, and our own public health experts for guidance in these areas. We will provide an update on our plans for housing and related matters by mid-June.

In the days and weeks ahead, you will begin hearing from specialized areas about the phased return to on-site operations. Deans, unit heads, supervisors and team leaders will inform individuals about specific, local plans when the time is right. Please also continue to visit our information hub at www.uci.edu/coronavirus for updates throughout the coming weeks.

I could not be more proud of the way our university has responded to this crisis. We did what was necessary to help protect ourselves and our community. But, the time has come to plan for, and imagine, a new day. Our UCI Health community is doing the same, as you can see from a rough-cut of this wonderful [What’s Next TV](https://vimeo.com/redbearfilms/review/416505686/d89cd00a15) spot running later this month. We are all about creating a [Brilliant Future](https://brilliantfuture.uci.edu) for ourselves and the world, and every journey begins with a few short steps.

With all best wishes to all of you, and your loved-ones, friends and neighbors. Stay safe. Be Well.

Of course, we’re not experts by any means but thought it would be beneficial to have college students connect with each other during these times using Slack.

We took a midterm over 2 weeks ago that was confusing and randomly formatted without instructions. For 1 of the questions, he even had a typo, but decided to give everyone credit for that problem. Other than that, the midterm had 5 other questions, 2 of which were given without any instructions.

After complaints from most of the class, the professor said the midterm would be graded leniently and decided to change the weight of it from 30% to 15%. The scores came back today and the class avg was 57.8% even after his ""lenient"" grading.

In addition to this, he has made it his purpose to make the quizzes more challenging, to the point where the avg. went from 8/10 (before the midterm) to 3.6/10 (after the midterm).

You would think that after writing such a terrible midterm, he would become more fair in terms of grading, but instead, he has made it worse with the quizzes.

On top of all of this, he simply cannot teach. He reads off the textbook and talks to himself during his lectures. He lacks confidence, and it effects his ability to teach, as he sounds like he doesn't believe in what he says.

I have talked to several of my classmates, and we all felt that the midterm and the direction of the class moving forward has been totally unfair. We prepared for that midterm expecting to be tested on all the concepts, instead we given randomly formatted questions.

I wanted to start a complaint to the dean/math dept but I don't know where to start. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks!

\*\*Edit:

I wanted to point this out so you guys can see how sensitive he is as a person. He has noticed that people are criticizing his teaching abilities on his rate my professor page, so he has began making his own posts. 

Here is a review that was posted before our scores even came out. They were several weeks behind in grading so how can this person feel ""fullfilled"" and ""rewarded."" Just look at the wording; it's so obvious that this is written by him/ someone associated with him.

""He gave us lots of thought provoking and challenging assignments. My hard work was rewarded, and I am feeling fulfilled. He is willing to help solving mathematical problems."" - Xin Dong, 2020, about himself. ([https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2461634](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2461634))

I am just truly disappointed in him. I feel like he is using his power at this point as a form of intimidation in response to all the backlash he is receiving for his teaching abilities and class structure."

A message from Chancellor Howard Gillman
Dear UCI Community,

To paraphrase Winston Churchill, we are nearing the end of the beginning. After an anxious two months of sheltering, our community is eager to fully experience the light of a new day.

At UCI, we’re ready for what’s next. Our Strategic Advisory Group, skillfully led by Interim Provost Hal Stern, has been in place for several weeks, mapping out the details related to our workforce, research, students (current and prospective), instruction (undergraduate and graduate), health (patient and public), technology, and business operations.

Their good work paved the way to a new chapter in the COVID-19 environment. Starting today, we will begin to share our plans for reengaging some campus operations, beginning the careful transition from remote work.

Not all of us will return to the campus at the same time or soon. On-site operations will resume at a gradual pace, with some areas ready for in-person operations before others. Some mission-critical areas that involve discrete locations and smaller numbers of people, such as some lab research, will likely resume first while many others may continue to work remotely for an extended period. We will do this with care, in phases, assessing as we go, building on lessons learned. You will be informed when your unit is prepared to begin a transition phase.

The phase-in decisions are being made with an abundance of thought and planning, with the health of our community at the forefront. Our guiding principles are as follows:

Our primary concern is our people. Plans and activities will incorporate precautions to help protect the health and safety of our faculty, students, staff, patients, research participants and visitors. We will create a process to accommodate those who believe they cannot return to an in-person work environment.
We will follow public health directives. This includes guidelines on physical distancing, large-group gatherings, masking, protective equipment and testing, as outlined by federal, state and local governments and our own public health experts.
Transitions will be measured, careful, and flexible. Decisions will be made based on thorough planning in light of prevailing and anticipated public health guidance, with a commitment to assessing the impact of each new step before proceeding to the next, and with a willingness to retreat to earlier phases if necessary.
We will learn as we proceed and incorporate new techniques and technologies as they become available. We are already learning lessons from existing campus activities, and new methods and discoveries are emerging rapidly. We will adjust our plans as new testing, tracing and therapies become available.
Our standards of quality will not waver. Whether our activities are remote or on-site, we will continue to provide a high-quality experience for our students, faculty, staff and community.
As for the fall quarter, here is what we know. Classes will start on schedule. Most classes will be offered remotely, either as the only option or a complement to in-person instruction. We are doing everything possible to prepare classrooms for in-person instruction, but it’s too early to determine which courses will be ready for traditional on-site learning. Deans and department chairs are working with our Office of Teaching and Learning to identify which classes can be prioritized for in-person instruction. It is likely that there will be a higher percentage of in-person graduate classes than undergraduate classes, given the nature of graduate instruction in most disciplines and the apartment-style nature of most on-campus graduate housing. Small studios and labs may be more possible than large lectures. Most importantly, all students enrolled in the fall will be able to begin or continue their courses of study. More information about our plans will be sent to students soon.

And here is what we don’t know about the fall. We’re still working on how many residents we are able to accommodate in student housing, especially in our large undergraduate dorms. We are committed to having as many students on campus as possible, but we need more time and information to plan a re-population of housing. Rooms with three or four residents probably will not be possible, but doubles may be acceptable, depending on dorm policies and safety regulations. We also don’t know how large gatherings – from sporting events and festivals to lectures and symposia – will be structured, but it’s safe to assume we will be following physical distancing protocols throughout the quarter. We are working with outside governing bodies, such as the NCAA and local health agencies, and our own public health experts for guidance in these areas. We will provide an update on our plans for housing and related matters by mid-June.

In the days and weeks ahead, you will begin hearing from specialized areas about the phased return to on-site operations. Deans, unit heads, supervisors and team leaders will inform individuals about specific, local plans when the time is right. Please also continue to visit our information hub at www.uci.edu/coronavirus for updates throughout the coming weeks.

I could not be more proud of the way our university has responded to this crisis. We did what was necessary to help protect ourselves and our community. But, the time has come to plan for, and imagine, a new day. Our UCI Health community is doing the same, as you can see from a rough-cut of this wonderful What’s Next TV spot running later this month. We are all about creating a Brilliant Future for ourselves and the world, and every journey begins with a few short steps.

With all best wishes to all of you, and your loved-ones, friends and neighbors. Stay safe. Be Well.

As we wrap up this school year, here is a small encouragement message to the current undeclared students out there.

I wanted to start off by saying that you should be proud of all the hard work you've accomplished in your first or second year here at UCI. All of you belong here and are more than capable of reaching your goals. I understand that many of you are currently taking prerequisites for an intended major or don't really know what to major in. I'm here to say that in the end, everything will work out. Don't let anyone (counselors) demotivate you or bring you down as you try to figure out what you want to major in. Make a plan of what classes you need and always keep up to date with the change of major prerequisites. I too was an undeclared student with a 2.2 GPA in the end of my first year. I had no idea what I wanted to major in and quite honestly, I thought my life was at stake. TLDR, it was not. I am now finishing up my third year as a computer science major (3.2 GPA). I look back on the struggles I had to go through like signing up for impacted classes and maintaining good grades and I know many of you are going through this. Keep on pushing, it'll all be worth it in the end. I believe in you guys. Zot zot zot!

If anyone wants to talk, you can always shoot me a private message!

Each day I go on, it always says they’re unavailable and always go in the middle of the day so I know they’re not closed.

Today I went on and I didn’t get the message that they weren’t available so I left a message asking for some guidance and about 30 seconds after I sent it it closed. So I had to start over, and the second time it couldn’t find me someone to talk to for over 20 min so it closed. I gave it some time and tried again but when I went on it gave me the message stating that no one was available.

I also called and left a couple voicemails today.

Both are similar costs.

UCI pros:

1. biggest uc of its size
2. better name, not sure if it matters too much
3. better food around from what I've read
4. better student life?

UCI cons:

1. got in for CompE, but want to switch to CS. Heard it could be difficult.

1. Guaranteed my major (CS)

3. practice rooms in dorms

UCR cons:

At the graduate level, planning is still underway to determine which courses will be in-person.

Tagline: IMPORTANT: Correction Email Regarding UCI Class Structure for Fall 2020

Dear Incoming Graduate Students,

First of all, I’d like to welcome you to UCI! Congratulations on your acceptance and your choice to come to UCI. Next, I want to offer you a sincere apology. We thought we had been sending you regular messages, updating you on the status of life here at UCI, and we recently learned that our software was misconfigured, and none of you were getting any of them! On the plus side, things change so fast in the COVID world, that we can now give you the latest information without the burden of any past confusion.

Speaking of confusion, it appears that some of you recently received an email from Vice Provost Michael Dennin indicating fall courses will be online. Please note that he was only referring to undergraduate courses. Graduate courses tend to be much smaller, and graduate students who live on campus live in very different housing than undergraduates.
So, what can you expect for fall?

Coursework: Approximately 30-40% of graduate courses in the fall will be offered in-person. The Registrar’s office is still in the process of updating its course catalogue for the new academic year, and we will let you know when that is updated and where you can go to see it. For those who may be unable to attend class in-person due to your own health challenges, inability to enter the country, and so on, faculty are committed to providing you a way to complete your coursework. Please work with your graduate program directors on your particular needs.

Other Activities on Campus: Graduate School is about so much more than coursework. You may have internships, networking, research, and other scholarly work as well as engage in clubs and other UCI organizations. Despite the impacts we have experienced, these activities are continuing. We switched all activities to virtual in March and beginning June 8 have launched a phased in-person restart to the rest. This includes a wide variety of things like the library, research labs, entrepreneurial resources, cultural and racial affinity groups, our recreation center for your own exercise, and our sports if you want to watch others exercise. UCI has a universal face covering policy, significant deployment of hand sanitizer and new cleaning regimens, as well as limited access to stairwells, elevators, and rooms. We will respond as a campus as the public health issues change, and we will keep you as informed as we are able.

Housing: Graduate students with housing guarantees are being offered leases now. If you are unable to make it to campus due to COVID or visa-related challenges, please work with housing to decline your spot. You will retain your guarantee. If you would prefer not to move in but are otherwise able you will not necessarily be able to retain your guarantee. Students without guarantees are on waitlists, and we need to move to provide them housing opportunities as well. You may also be asked to be sequestered in your apartment for a period upon arrival to campus. The protocols here are still being put in place. Please work with housing on your move in date and needs. Please visit housing.uci.edu or email housing@uci.edu for more information.
What if I have more questions?

In general, your graduate program advisor—usually a faculty member in your new department—is the best first person to go to with questions. Should have any for us centrally, though, please don’t be shy. You can email grad@uci.edu anytime for questions about life once you are here and gradapplicant@uci.edu for any questions about life before you arrive, getting paperwork to us, and so on.


Finally, please save the date for September 25 for a virtual graduate orientation. Most of the events will be recorded, and you can access them anytime, but some will be live. Also please be on the lookout for an email regarding another virtual town hall that we will be holding soon. This is meant to be a space where I and my panel of experts can address your specific questions and concerns. We hope to see you at both!

Best wishes for a safe arrival to campus. Welcome!

Dean Gillian

But they’re also saying it hasn’t been confirmed that they can cancel our leases. The form for the cancellation request is more of an interest form to cancel. Am I the only one who thought they already said we are able to cancel or did I misinterpret it earlier?

From ACC:

While UCI is planning on welcoming students back to on-campus housing for the 2020-21 year, we are working with the University to come to a decision on whether we are able to cancel leases for leaseholders who do not wish to return to campus.  We have been told that more information will be given by July 10, 2020, at which time we can confirm whether we can cancel your lease or not.  Leaseholders who wish to terminate their 2020-2021 lease agreement may now fill out an interest form to indicate their intent to cancel.  To begin that process, please complete the online form at the web address listed below.

Just want to post and say that if anyone is currently attending UCI or will be attending UCI and they need to **FULFILL** their Language Requirement because they *only took two years of Spanish Language at their high school* \- DO NOT ENROLL IN SPANISH AT UCI and waste one year worth of classes.

Enroll in ***Saddleback Community College for Spanish 2*** by providing a high school transcript and they will waive you out of Spanish 1 as long as you have taken two years of Spanish Language in High School. Saddleback will put you in ***Spanish 2 which is equivalent to UCI Spanish 1C***. Spanish 2 at Saddleback is online and it is easy. Spanish 2 at Saddleback Community College is offered every semester online.

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of my friends and I are taking Spanish 2 and it's just busywork, but not hard.

\- All work is submitted through Saddleback Canvas. For us, quizzes have unlimited attempts and unlimited time. Online Chapter Exams are 50 questions but, you have 90 minutes to complete. As long as you try on the assignments, the professor will give you a good grade. The professor we are taking this class with is Connie Kihyet.

&amp;#x200B;

It is an online class compared to UCI Spanish classes, which you have to attend every day (Mon-Fri) That's fufu. Don't waste time taking one whole year of Spanish at UCI, when you can take one class at Saddleback Community College and get the language requirement done in 6 to 8 weeks online. My friends and I  are currently enrolled in Spanish 2 and our counselors from the UCI Engineering/ICS department have approved and said that Spanish 2 covers the Spanish 1C Requirement for UCI. One of my friends from the Bio Sci and another from the Social Science Department said their counselors also approved Spanish 2 at Saddleback. **The class enrollment/registration costs a total of $260.00 for me.**

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the link to Saddleback CC Website:

[https://www.saddleback.edu/](https://www.saddleback.edu/)

&amp;#x200B;

***ADDITIONAL:***

If people are interested in enrolling for the future semester:

Visit the website\^ and look for enrollment and registration dates for future semesters, so you're not left behind. The Community College application for Saddleback is not long and it's mostly filling out personal information and educational information and it can be done in less than 15 minutes, just make sure you apply right away. Also, make sure to have high school transcripts with you so that you can either email them to the Spanish Department at Saddleback or drop them in person assuming the Saddleback Campus re-opens

&amp;#x200B;

***ADDITIONAL PT.2:***

If people do not want to take Spanish and they want to take another language like French. This option is available to them. HOWEVER, THE SAME RULES APPLY TO YOU GUYS! You need two years of French classes in High school which will waive you out of French 1 at Saddleback and you will be enrolled for **French 2** at Saddleback and this is equivalent to **UCI French 1C** and you are good to go!

NOTE: French 2 at Saddleback was not available this Summer (2020), but it is available for Fall 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hope everyone is doing well and Hope everyone is Safe!

I just graduated cum laude in bio sci, and I thought I’d compile a list of tips that helped me get through my four years successfully. Feel free to add on to these, or to AMA about my experience! 

*TL;DR:* basically the paragraph above lol 

1. Hit the ground running. Yes, the beginning of the quarter is fun and slow (compared to the other nine weeks), but that doesn’t make it any less important. GO TO CLASS starting day 1, and KEEP GOING TO CLASS for the rest of the quarter. Even if it’s online, hold yourself to a regular schedule because it’ll help you a lot.

2. Find your note-taking style and stick to it. If you prefer written notes, buy some notebooks and pens. If you prefer typing, have that doc ready. 

3. MAKE STUDY SHEETS FOR YOURSELF. The one thing that helped me the most was a many-step review process before exams: 

Take notes on my laptop during class

Re-take notes by hand by re-watching the lecture/ going through the slides and my typed notes (only if the professor didn’t post podcasts) 

Consolidate those notes onto a two-page review sheet the day before the exam 

^Basically, the more times you write out and think about the concepts, the easier it will be 

4. Don’t be afraid to ask for help. Ask your professors, your friends, the people older than you... anyone who has experience with the material. Also, ask people about professors because RMP isn’t always the best representation. 

5. Don’t stress about being on a timeline. Yes, most bio majors are premed/health and that creates an atmosphere of competition, but for your own sake don’t compare yourself with the people around you. Be proud of your accomplishments, take your career plans at your own pace, and allow yourself to move past the setbacks when they come up. 

6. Don’t slack off in the easy classes. 

7. Take every opportunity you can. If you hear about something cool, join it. If you see an application for a club/org, submit it. I’m applying for jobs now during my gap year and I am so thankful I took opportunities when they presented themselves. 

8. Learn some stats. And not just stats 7/8, learn how to use software like R or SPSS. There are so many entry-level research positions (which you might be looking at for your gap year) that require experience with one or more of these. Honestly Mauzy Melitz (notorious bio 100 professor) was a pain in many ways, but she did teach us R which is a great skill. She’s not teaching anymore so you’ll have to find some other way to learn it, possibly through Bio 199. 

9. Get involved in research. We’re a research university, and there are literally hundreds of opportunities for every field of interest. It doesn’t have to be bench research, it can be anything you want, so be sure to give research a try. It really expands your thinking and is great for your resume. 

10. Take great classes, which you’re also interested in! Here are my suggestions: 

E109 with Loudon (or any other good professor, idk if she’s still teaching) 

D103 with McGregor and Suetterlin 

N110 with either of the trios 

N165 with Brewer 

N170 with McEwan 

N173 with Yassa 

M118L with Brewer 

E112L with Aguilar Roca 

Like I said at the beginning, feel free to ask me anything and to add on to this!"

Since I was a first hand witness to this all this messed up stuff. I’m willing to go into details if anyone asks. This time I am not afraid to use names so that the real culprits are brought to light. 

Just know, all of you, the undergrads and incoming undergrads, PAY for these people to support you and your student initiative and advocacy stances. 

(Maybe even sign the petition to finally put an end to this dumb power play: https://petition.studentgov.uci.edu?)

—-Tea—

Last school year we had heavy amounts of cronyism, discrimination, and an extreme amounts of non-transparency with in ASUCI

Many students were unhappy with the student government last since they didn’t want to allow a student vote for the womxn hub referendum and after several horrible truths came to light (it’s spicy but idk it’s kinda long). 

So the student petitioned and successfully used direct democracy to call for the recall of senators (so a re-election).

As an abuse of power, senators were like nope. Then delayed and refused their re-election by finding a loophole and putting it in legislation limbo... twice.

Note that several events happened, people were hired without interviews, position applications would suddenly be open for less than the usual (a week), no more school-wide emails for open positions, and all of if was seen as okay because 1. We were in a “rush” 
2. We don’t have any “rules” saying how to hire so we can change it up if we want to.

-basically they were unethical as heck finding loopholes to make sure things went their way. At the cost of students belief and opportunity. 

Of course students and other branches were mad and called for transparency. There was a lot  anger on BOTH sides. (Student to Senators, senators to students)

In the as retaliation to the students call for transparency, last years senate decided to pass a 62 page bylaw which made passing any legislation, and even reverting any of their past messed up legislations take more than a month with a needed 100% approval from several unrelated branches (essentially making it impossible to pass things) While not even informing the public at least a day ahead about these changes. There were a lot more messed up things, and I’ll talk about it if it comes up.

To allow the new ASUCI to function and fix the past corruption, I would encourage anyone coming in or still going to UCI to read and sign these petitions!

I have a strong belief that if the purposely malicious legislation is repealed, then the ASUCI this year will represent the students far better than last years.

TDLR: Please repeal the legislation that they made as a result of questionable unethical means. Let the new Asuci represent you and get rid of old malicious stuff.

I was just kind of hoping to make this more transparent than buried in those Covid update emails...if i messed something up please let me know!

Yo! i made this post largely because i think the university is downplaying their covid problem.

First of all, these data are just based on me combing through the links on [https://uci.edu/coronavirus/updates/](https://uci.edu/coronavirus/updates/) and just tallying them up in excel (see ""Updates by Month"" on the side of that webpage). I seem to be missing 8 cases based on their tally of 59 (as of July 14th). Does anyone have access to a day by day count of cases? *I am in no way saying this is 100% accurate...it is informal and just the best i could do.* I do not work in public health.

Secondly, the university keeps pushing ahead (especially with graduate students) on re-opening more and more. I feel strongly that UCI is full of brilliant scientists and other academics. Im confused why, in the face of growing positive cases, we are talking about reopening more and more. I hear a lot of ""We are 100% committed to the safety of staff and students"". What a line...

Irvine's sheen of ""perfection"" extends to this awesome campus (also Palm Springs on Hulu was pretty fun if you got to watch that). However, it might be time to pay closer attention to the reality of this situation.

Originally I joined because of positive intentions - I wanted to make new friends, build network, new experiences, do community service, belong somewhere etc. Initially when I joined it was rly exciting and I was happy. The sorority that I picked was full of genuine girls and I was drawn to it.

I got my big but after the reveal she literally never tried, she was always busy and never made effort to be actually be a big or be my friend. When I became an active, things kind of went downhill. There was a group of 3 girls from my pledge class that I was close to, and I thought we were a good solid friend group. However 2 of the girls started to bother me a little, and they literally never put effort in my friendship, so I emotionally removed them. The remaining girl however, still talked to me through the summer and I used  to think that she was my only true friend from sorority. However over time she stopped talking to me much, never actually hung out and never made effort, still considers me a friend, but her actions didn't prove it. I started to feel alone and isolated. I didn't even get bday wishes from a single girl this year. I was casual friends with some girls but at the end of the day I didn't really have anyone to rely on.

So for fall recruitment I was excited to meet and recruit new girls so there'll be new faces. I began looking for a little, and I had 2 top choices that were pretty good. First girl we just instantly clicked and had things in common and I loved her, however she sucked at keeping touch or hanging out. It didn't happen. Second girl I hung out with multiple times, I was like an older mentor to her, we had a good bond and I was there for her emotionally. However she ended up getting someone else as a big, I think she wanted someone younger, idk. I felt so shitty. I didn't have my own circle and I spent most of the year watching other girls go out and hang out and study together all the time but I never got invited or included. It wasn't a matter of excluding me on purpose, it was just that I wasn't really part of their group.

I do have close friends in college, ones that I've made in other clubs or other places on campus. I was hoping for a positive sorority experience, but instead felt more isolated and alone. Maybe it is my fault, since I could've invested more into the friendships. Maybe I was just unlucky or chose the wrong sorority. Greek life at UCI is tight knit and diverse so I'm not saying every single girl goes through what I went through... In fact, the experience depends on every person and what they make out of it. Mine just happened to be a sad one.

I still haven't left the sorority though, and the reason is that I do have an appreciation for my organization. It is an old national organization with good values and good people. I'm staying for the networking opportunities and alumni network postgrad. But now I'm not so sure if staying is worth it :(

TL;DR I joined sorority for new people and experiences but ended up not feeling close to anyone. All my ""friends"" weren't true friends and I ended up being lonely and isolated"

LAs are not required to help students outside of class but I always enjoyed it so I figured I would try it out so I could also make a little extra pocket money.

To start, I'm going to skip the obvious ""think of your peers and community"" point, because if you're throwing a party, you probably don't really care whether or not your actions affect your community. I will drop [this](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/11/us/college-campus-outbreak-covid.html) though (use the UCI VPN to make an NYT account and view NYT articles, if you didn't already know. This particular article might be open to all, as I just realized I'm not on the VPN). There are several colleges who test regularly and require masks on-campus and all, but they're still having outbreaks that spread out of the campus community and into the general town community.

To the topic at hand now. Over Labor Day weekend, a group of Miami University students held a [presumably all-COVID house party](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/11/us/miami-university-student-party-covid-trnd/index.html). It seems like it'd fine, right? Everyone has COVID, thus no one is in danger. Except that might not be the case. I want to bring [viral load](https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/sars-cov-2-viral-load-and-the-severity-of-covid-19/) to your attention. Basically, there's preliminary evidence that suggests that the more virus you have in your system, the more severe your symptoms will be. There's also evidence to suggest this isn't the case: we need more analysis and data. [Evidence suggests that many who test positive using a PCR test (what we'll be using at UCI) have very little virus in them](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html). Could this be why people are asymptomatic? I'm not sure. Since we don't test enough people and focus testing on people with symptoms, we'll probably never know. And if you do develop symptoms, you probably won't die. But the [potential side effects](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-long-term-effects/art-20490351) read out like a TV prescription medicine ad: permanent/long-lasting heart, liver, brain (!), lung, kidney damage. Do you want to take that chance?

In short, if you're not going to be considerate of the people in your community, be selfish and protect yourself.

EDIT: With regards to the house party article: ""The police report indicates that the sixth person identified himself as a student who had moved in with his parents and was visiting for the  weekend."" Take this stuff seriously, people. We don't know all the context, BUT IT DOESN'T matter. Even *if* the student's parents had COVID before, [immunity doesn't last forever](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-long-does-immunity-last-after-covid-19-what-we-know) and lingers for varying amounts of time: we have even confirmed that one can be re-infected with [our own stateside reinfection case](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-reinfection-case-confirmed-us.html)."

Hear me out, I keep seeing activism posts on a lot of stories on instagram which is awesome but then there are some people who post stuff like “All cops are bastards” and “if you’re not going to protests, you’re the oppressor” and while I can vaguely understand the sentiment, i feel it’s very harsh to say that without understanding people’s circumstances. These people, in my opinion, are privileged to even say something like that without thinking about people who can’t afford expensive covid treatments or have family problems/ members who are of old age or other problems in their lives that are more important to deal with such as housing/food insecurity etc.

Being a liberal myself, I feel that some people are overdoing it to an extent that they’re coming off as very intolerant and aggressive. The language they use is meant to hurt people and not to stimulate intellectually stimulating conversations. What I have seen in my friends, who can be very ignorant at times, is that they don’t really know much about the economic and political repercussions of what they’re saying rather they’re just saying it to virtue signal. For example, some people were saying during the rapid attention to BLM that burning buildings and supermarkets is the right thing to do and peaceful protests are useless or saying that the police needs to be abolished but when asking them how we’re going to deal with that and what the plan is moving forward, they don’t have an answer. 

Don’t get me wrong, a lot of people are willing to listen to the other point of view, are willing to have a proper discussion and are actually informed about the matter they’re talking about but then there are a lot of people who don’t necessarily want to learn or have a conversation, don’t have any facts, and want to create more divide ( which is what the politicians want you to do btw). What upsets me is the lack of information people have compared to the big ideas they’re throwing around.

At the end of the day, I have respect for most of them as well since what they’re doing makes sense to me but I don’t appreciate HOW they’re doing it. Thank you for reading all my stuff, If you want to reply to me, you’re more than welcome to. I’m willing to get more input on this and maybe understand the other side as well!"

This week I got hired by an IT company and am now a an IT technician with tons of growth potential work from home and will learn a ton about servers and info structures. But I’ve also gotten an offer from a government agency (can’t speak on this) as well. 

What I’m trying to say is that your degree is not necessarily only to work in a certain field, your options are limitless if you apply yourself. I highly recommend using UCIs resume workshop as well. 

A degree really does say something about you. 
And of course having UCI attached to it is a plus.

I was undeclared my first two years (had no clue what to do smh) and finally made the switch to Computer Science this past summer. It would be greatly appreciated if anyone could give any advice on what classes to take next quarter? I assume my class schedule would be really weird going forward from now. What I mean by this is that I am barely taking ICS33 this quarter, so I know for sure I need to take 45C next quarter. But other than that, I don't really have a clue. 

I'm done with all my other G.E.s so all that's left for me to take are basically CS / Informatics upper div classes. But the thing is, I only know Python since I'm just barely finishing up the ICS30 series this quarter, and I get the sense that that's going to make upper divs really tough for me.

Current Classes: ics33, ics51, ics139w, inf43

Prospective Classes for winter: ics45c, ??? , ??? , ???

Any advice is greatly appreciated! I'm thinking of Information as my specialization (not set on that tho)"

Many of us are trying to take classes online too while juggling research, TA and everything else related to COVID so we know how it feels to be exhausted as students right now. 

The class I TA for has added a lot more prep work and set up onto TAs than normal and it has been really time consuming and draining. On top of dealing with a death in the family and also taking my own classes online, it's been a tough quarter.  However, I feel like I need to get up and be enthusiastic when teaching because of my position and I know some of my students are probably dealing with worse. I totally feel you guys when classes pose an unreasonable challenge amongst all of this. It's a weird in-between of wishing things could be easier for all of us and needing to enforce the requirements of a class...not sure if my other fellow TAs feel this way but I wanted to put what I felt out there."

It would appear that they took the liberty of scraping the LinkedIn profiles of UCI alumni (along with alumni from other universities) to populate profiles on their social media network (which looks to be utter garbage). Once they have your profile data, they then email you telling you to login to claim your profile.

While this feels like a privacy issue, I don't believe it is – it is legal to scrape public LinkedIn data and in many cases that is not a bad thing. Rather the issue, in my view, is one of autonomy  – I did not sign up nor do I have any interest in being affiliated with Alumni Alliances. That they have generated a digital representation of my identity *without my knowledge or permission* and then attempted to *coerce* me into joining their platform so I can maintain control over my digital identity is abusive. I'm left with two unpalatable options; either I sign up and engage with their 'service' against my will or I have a digital identity floating around that may be out of date, inaccurate, and unauthorized by me that could have untoward consequences. So now, to my questions:

\- Has anyone else received emails from Alumni Alliances?

\- Has anyone 'claimed' their account?

\- Are their any individuals with legal expertise in this space who can provide some indication as to whether this is legal or not and whether it is grounds for a class action – could this be a false light?

I have attempted to contact them requesting that they remove all data related to me. Will report back if I hear anything."

l6igs6,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/l6igs6/ics_ics33_moss_and_the_office_of_academic/,"ICS, ICS-33, MOSS, and the Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct",54,56,2021-01-27 16:09:04,"**Earlier today** a student in my ICS-33 course posted a question about how to deal with a charge of academic misconduct. It was mostly a respectful post, asking for help in understanding the issues. I spent about an hour writing a response, less to that student (who I have been emailing since the issue arose), but mostly to other UCI students, especially those in ICS who might take my course in the future. 

After I posted my response, the student then immediately removed their post and my response. I'm not sure why: there was nothing objectionable in the original post or my response. While I cannot obtain the student's original post on redditt, I have obtained my response, which I have posted below.  I have not changed my response, which sometimes refers, but only obliquely to the student's post.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm the professor; I've been in contact with the student by many emails; I have offered to meet with the student (before I read this reddit post), although I don't believe the student will supply any more useful evidence in the meeting: evidence that I and OAISC would find useful to evaluate that case.

I'm replying here not to the student, but to other students who might go through my course (or other courses in ICS), so they can better understand the tools we use in ICS to detect cheating. Also, it is a chance for students to ""look into how a faculty member thinks about things"" which is sometimes enlightening to students.

I'll listen to what students have to say about how they worked on the program, see their communications, let them explain their programs, and hear about their ethical and moral belief systems, but little of that is evidence. The evidence in this case is that I ran MOSS, a program that measures structural similarities between programs (ignoring issues of variable names, formatting, and other things students often change to ""make a copied program LOOK different""). I ran MOSS on the five parts of Programming Assignment #1. It is true that I specify what functions must be written. Students might think then, that all solutions must therefore look pretty much the same; but they are wrong. The functions are complicated and there is tremendous variation in the structure of student solutions. OAISC is well versed in reading MOSS output, because a large percentage of ICS cases submitted to them are based on MOSS.

In this case, MOSS matched the poster's 5 solutions, at a high level of similarity ( a couple of standard deviations above the mean), against all 5 programs submitted by a student from Winter 2020. Based on a decade of my use of MOSS, with thousands of students and tens of thousands of programs, it is pretty much game over at this point for me: that evidence is overwhelming. But, my protocol is to look even further. MOSS points me at similar programs: out of the 1,500 submitted this quarter and the 10s of thousands in my database; I could never look at all of them in detail, but when MOSS tells me which to look at, I can examine them under a micrscope). When I examine them, I use my own cognitive power to find further ""anomalies"" of a kind that MOSS doesn't find, but I've been finding for 43 years -predating MOSS by decades. The gold standard for an OAISC case is MOSS + anomalies. I don't want to expose all my techniques here, but for one example, a program was supposed to recognize and process the user entering the string ""done"". When I scrutinized the code, I realized that both programs included the string ""done,"" (ending in a comma) instead. The string was not incorrect -in how it was used- but it was strange, and the simpler string sufficed. So I used grep (google it) and found that in my database of about 3,000 programs solving this problem only these two had that string. There are other examples that I won't get into here; I've spent hours analyzing the 5 pairs of programs MOSS identified and found many such anomalies.

When I contacted the student, I said I was investigating a possible case of academic misconduct. Generally, I don't lay out all the details, because I want to give the student a chance to admit to cheating -if they did- and show remorse before they know all the gory details of the case; I do so because OAISC specifically asks me whether a student has accepted responsibility, and I like to be able to say ""yes, without even know all the evidence"". The student said they did not cheat, so I showed them the MOSS output and asked them to explain just a few of the anomalies. My interpretation of the student's response was, ""it was just an unlucky coincidence"". Occam's razor says when choosing between two competing theories, choose the simplest. In this case a simpler explanation is that the student based their program off someone else's work.

Can I prove it: can I prove that the Winter 2020 student gave their code to the other student or posted the code somewhere where the other student found it? Probably no, but I'll petition OIT through OAISC to check the student's emails; I know from doing this in the past that such a search is not likely to turn up a ""smoking gun"". Students have many less traceable ways to communicate. OAISC doesn't require such proof, if the other evidence is strong enough.

A few loose ends UCI students should know.

Dropping a course doesn't stop the OAISC process. Generally the first offense is treated as a learning experience, and the University sanction is equivalent to a warning (but in egregious cases of cheating, by students with advanced standing, it can be immediately suspension); but a second offense is likely to be penalized with a suspension from UCI for one or more quarters.

The faculty member can decide how to deal with grading a student who commits academic misconduct. I took a recent survey of instructors teaching lower-division ICS courses and the penalties ranged from a 0 on the assignment to immediately receiving an F in the course. Instructors decide their own policies, which they must publish: know what the policy is for every course you take.

Generally, information kept by OAISC is private, not accessible by anyone outside UCI (I state this information with the hope that knowing it doesn't embolden students). When the student shared issues about immigration status I wrote Brittany Kim (an Associate Director of Academic Integrity). Here was my question and her answer.

"" Can the US government immigration service access OAISC records? "". Her response was "" No, they cannot. But if they have consent from the student they can have the student pull their disciplinary record from our office or have them self-report out. ""

I've now almost reached the end of a very long response. I didn't expect to write so much publicly this morning, but I will take this student's prompt as a opportunity to explain a process most students won't experience at UCI, with the hope that knowledge of the process might dissuade students from committing academic misconduct. But truth be told, I spent an hour this morning very selfishly, because if I can stop one student from cheating in my course, I can save myself hours in the future (the typical amount of time it takes to communicate with a student and report a case to OAISC).

Last year, ICS reported 300 cases to OAISC: the most of any school at UCI (followed closely by Physical Sciences: together we account for about 22% of UCI students and 70% of the cases reported to OAISC).

Does that mean our students are more dishonest than students in other schools? No, not by a long shot. It does mean we care about academic integrity and have tools to monitor it. We certainly don't catch everyone who cheats. But, we owe (by spending lots of our own time) the fairest playing field we can provide to the students in our classes who don't cheat."

***FAQ:***

**What are the on-campus housing options?**

The direct on-campus dorms are Mesa Court/Middle Earth (Towers). The other options are Arroyo Vista and the ACC apartments.

**I would like to live in a dorm, how would I do so?**

Direct on-campus dorms are usually exclusive to freshmen and a few sophomore and juniors, for everyone else the other on-campus options are either Arroyo Vista or the ACC apartments.

**What is ACC?**

ACC is an apartment company that has partnerships with universities such as UCI to help build on-campus housing for students. The five ACC apartments at UCI are Vista del Campo, Vista del Campo Norte, Camino del Sol, Puerta del Sol, and Plaza Verde. The apartments are considered of decent quality and many students enjoy their amenities.

**When do applications open?**

Housing applications for 2021-2022 open January 20th.

**How do I apply?**

For dorms/Arroyo Vista: [http://my.housing.uci.edu/gateway](http://my.housing.uci.edu/gateway) (Unsure if this works)

For ACC apartments you have to apply on their respective websites: [https://housing.uci.edu/acc/](https://housing.uci.edu/acc/)

**I would like to house with my friends, how can I do so?**

If you and your friends receive a spot in the same dorm/apartment community you can request to be put together on the given form.

**Will I receive financial aid for living in one of the ACC apartments?**

Yes, the ACC apartments are considered as on-campus housing and you will receive aid.

**What dorm/ACC apartment is the best/what should I pick?**

I’ll post a few relevant past comments near the bottom of the thread detailing past comments of experiences from living in their respective ACC apartments, and others are encouraged to comment their own relevant past experiences. I would refrain from looking too much into online Google/Yelp reviews for the ACC apartments.

**How much does \_\_\_\_\_\_ housing cost?**

Each of the dorm/apartment options have different room/floor plans with different pricings for each.

**The ACC apartments/Arroyo Vista seem far from the main campus buildings, will I really have to walk that distance?**

UCI has a free shuttle dedicated for students that runs along all the on-campus housing options throughout the entire campus called the Anteater Express. The shuttles visit all stops every 3-7 minutes to pickup students.

**Should I get a dining hall meal plan?**

Generally, unless you are living in one of the dorms you should refrain from buying a meal plan as it's commonly not considered worth it at their prices. You can however still eat at the dining halls by begging a resident of a dorm to swipe you in for free/for a small charge.

**I wanna bring my car, where can I park?**

It depends on where you're planning to live, ex: Plaza Verde has its own parking structure while Camino del Sol requires you to park at the ARC parking structure.

**What other options are there?**

There are many off campus options such as UTC apartments which are potentially cheaper than on-campus options. We also have the Anteater Housing Network which has both on-campus and off-campus options to choose from.

**Please refrain from starting new housing related threads and instead refer to this thread/the comment section below. If you have previously dormed on campus or lived in an ACC apartment, you are encouraged to give your opinion of the place and state what you liked/disliked about living there to help other students. (Students who have lived in off-campus housing such as UTC are also welcome!)**

I’ll help kickstart the thread off with a recent comments containing relevant information that you may find useful when considering the options.

&gt;General Rankings:- Camino: Probably the best on campus apartments so far, debatably tied with Plaza Verde assuming that Plaza has fixed all of their issues. They have grills placed next to every apartment and inside personal laundries. They're the most expensive apartment community next to Plaza, some rooms have gigabit speeds but a majority of them only have 100 up/down.- Plaza: The newest on campus apartments here, the architecture and design of the lobby is beautiful. They had a lot of sewage and shower issues early on the Fall quarter (2019-2020), but I believe most of the problems have been fixed. Gigabit speeds on all the rooms and a 5 minute walk to Albertsons.- VDCN: Probably one of the most wanted on-campus apartments, it has the best ratio of price to room quality, not much to say as its decent.- Puerta: The closest to campus, I believe this is the smallest apartment community. Albertsons is right across the street so its very accessible for groceries, small issue is you have to cross the street every time you want to get to campus quick to get to the fast shuttle.- VDC: The farthest away from campus, it’s a secluded area that you normally wouldn’t go to. That being said, the room quality is similar to VDCN and at its price its still a solid bet.- Arroyo: The shittiest of the bunch, you get what you pay for here. Its very cheap but it’s not that great. Next to the frat houses so there’ll be a lot of loud parties near the night and they have a bad ants problem last time I heard.

From [u/may0910](https://www.reddit.com/u/may0910/):

&gt;I love Camino! At Camino you have your own single room and you can have a private bathroom or share a bathroom with your floormate. It is very expensive around $1000+ so if you're willing to spend a lot definitely live in Camino! I also lived in VDC Norte which is less expensive around $700 and i shared a room with someone where we had our own bathroom. It was fine except make sure the person you share your room with is compatible with you!!

From [u/hungryant3ater](https://www.reddit.com/u/hungryant3ater/):

&gt;I lived in VDCN last year and I loved it! I had the 2 bed 2 bath floor plan w/ an indoor laundry. The indoor laundry was really convenient because otherwise I would’ve had to go down 3 flights of stairs to get laundry done LOL, but it does raise the price. The apartment is pretty small, but it’s not too bad. I never had an issue w noise or robbery. And I lived really close to the graduate area where they have a lot of tables and study rooms so that was also a plus!The room came furnished with cable and wifi and up to $70 of electricity a month. If you exceed that amount, you just pay the difference. The room was in ok condition, and it had a big closet mirror. I had my own bathroom and it was decent. Also, once buses start running again, it’s really easy to get to campus bc of the N line, A/C line, and even the M line.The only cons I can think of are that it was pretty hard to move in all my belongings cuz I had to pass through these long ass hallways just to get to my apartment and that my apartment was $1000+, but you kinda get what you pay for. Hope this gives you some perspective!"

I got a B+ in ICS31 last quarter, so it’s not like I want to change majors because I’m doing bad. I just find coding to be tedious, stressful, and time consuming, especially for the projects. I don’t have the patience for work like that. I find the lectures to be very uninteresting to me, and I’m typically finding myself not retaining any of the information taught. I dread having to do any assignments for my classes. 

On the other hand, my parents are telling me I should stay as a CS major. They think that finding jobs as a Business Econ major would be more difficult than a CS major. This is what worries me as well. I’m worried I won’t be able to get a solid and secure job as opposed to if I had a CS degree.

I’m in need of some advice as to whether or not I should change majors. How is CS similar and different to Business Econ? I also would like to know my job options as a Business Econ major. I’m not exactly a people person, so I would really prefer an office job isolated from people. If not, I am also open to other majors recommendations.

I’m having a really hard time taking notes for her class. She doesn’t record her lectures and I heavily HEAVILY rewatch lectures to add onto my notes and just aid my retention of knowledge. I can record the audio on my phone but it doesn’t feel the same as an official Yuja/Zoom video. I feel like her slides and commentary are vague or disorganized, and she talks at a fast pace which makes me miss some things. I did decent on her first quiz but I was thrown off at a few of the questions that were asked since they weren’t really defined on the slides and it makes me really nervous to continue taking this course, especially since there’s only one midterm and one final that are a heavy weight on the grades. The textbook is required but she doesn’t state what sections to read. to be fair, she specified what chapters are covered each week but it’s rlly obvious that we don’t go over everything in the chapter and I feel like I have to fish for information all the time. I wish there were study/reading guides and I really really hope she’s considering practice exam problems/examples :(

I’m curious about the experience other ppl had if they took this course with other professors, or how ppl are currently holding up in this class and if y’all have any study tips/guides. I’ve considered dropping it since I’m currently taking 18 units and anatomy + cell bio already have me on a tight schedule daily but I’m holding off on the idea bc Im really interested in the course material and I hope that I’m just psyching myself out and I’ll eventually realize that this class isn’t too bad :,)"

Students of the Class of 2021 (myself included) are struggling to get the classes they need to graduate. Given the lack of response to this issue, I saw fit to make sure you were personally aware.

There is a horrible drought of project courses available this coming quarter, and for CS students who were not able to snag one in previous quarters due to student overpopulation, this is fatal. I was only able to enroll in a single project course for Spring 2021 - and as you're well aware, we need two total to graduate. CS 117, the only one of these I personally could get, is now full before even the entire graduating class got a chance to sign up.

My specialization is in Algorithms, and yet I was unable to sign up for the one project course in that field (CS 165) before its paltry 100 virtual seats were filled. I was also unable to sign up for CS 145, because the remaining open lab sections are major restricted to CSE. These classes were inaccessible as of Tuesday night, and especially by my enrollment window of 9:30AM. By the law of large numbers, my experience today was not unique.

I plead with you to not only add sections of these project courses, but prioritize enrollment by specialization and notify us directly rather than with a surprise drop. If more sections are added without that precaution, the surprise will be that the newly added sections are also immediately full of students scrambling to get something, anything, even if they don't truly want the class.

If you don't do something very soon, you're going to have a lot of disgruntled would-be-graduates on your hands.

Thank you for your consideration,

Cassi Leo"

I am a senior graduating in Spring 2021. During Week 6, I suffered a pretty serious injury that left me on bedrest for the past three weeks. I was immobile for the first two weeks, to the point where I was shitting in an adult diaper. Since I was in so much pain, I had to take really strong prescription painkillers that made me super loopy and drowsy. I obviously had to push back all my assignments and midterms because I was in no shape to take them. All of my professors have been extremely supportive of me, for which I am extremely grateful for. 

I am trying to get back on my foot now. I really am trying, but I can’t get seem to anything done. I had a panic attack yesterday just thinking about all the things I had to do, and spent the entirety of the day trying to pacify myself. I know deep down everything is going to be okay eventually, but this whole pandemic situation is really messing with my overall health. 

I am a straight A student. I have been working part time jobs to support myself throughout undergrad. I have received multiple merit-based scholarships. I will be graduating early, with two degrees and an honors distinction. I was accepted to a fully funded Ph.D. Program and will begin next Fall. So yes, I am your typical “successful” student. But I am still human, who is suffering just as much as anyone else. 

I have been noticing a lot of posts by fellow anteaters who seem to be really struggling lately. And I felt like a total bitch for not admitting that I am going through the same thing. Everyone in the UCI community is struggling right now, whether you are a student, faculty, admin staff, employee, etc.. I just wanted to put it out there that you are not alone.

The email says:


Dear students,

Given the continued current virtual environment and the challenges associated with it, the School of Social Sciences Undergraduate Student Affairs Office has decided to revise the process for change of grade.

Pass/Not Pass - WINTER 2021: 
PLEASE NOTE: For WINTER QUARTER 2021 ONLY, there will be no limit on how many P/NP (Pass/Not Pass) units in which you may enroll (in a traditional quarter, students may only enroll in an average of four units of P/NP per quarter). 

UPDATED INFORMATION: Additionally, requests to change to or from Pass/Not Pass will be considered thru 5:00pm Friday of Week 10 (the deadline was previously Week 6). MAJOR-required courses and courses to be used for the School's Math requirement must be taken for a letter grade. Any course you have previously taken for a letter grade and are repeating this quarter must also be taken for a letter grade. 

It is important when making the decision to take a course P/NP or for a letter grade that you keep in mind the following:
To receive a ""P"" (Pass) and get credit/units, you must earn a grade equivalent to a ""C"" or better. However, if a course is taken for a letter grade, the minimum grade needed for credit would be at least a ""D-"" in most courses.This is especially important to note for graduating students who are trying to fulfill their unit requirements to graduate.You will need to weigh the risk of taking a course P/NP and not receiving any credit if you earn the equivalent to a C- grade or lower.
If you are planning to change your major or add a double major, you will be responsible for adhering to the corresponding School’s P/NP policy.
Lower-division writing courses must be completed with a grade of ""C"" or better (or a ""P"" if taking the coursefor P/NP). If you are taking an upper-division writing course in your major, you must take the course for a letter grade. 
If you are retaking a course that was originally for a LETTER GRADE, you must retake the course for a LETTER GRADE ONLY - there are no exceptions.
We recommend that you see how you are doing in the courses throughout the quarter. You have until 5 PM on Friday of Week 10 to submit a request to change the grade option of a non-major course. (Grade option changes will not be considered after that time – there are no exceptions.)

You will need to submit an enrollment exception request throughStudent Accessto request any changes. You may also find more information about P/NP on the Registrar Office’s FAQ page. 

If you have any questions about this policy, please emailme.

Sincerely,

Helen Morgan, Director

The Atmel Programmer is \~$100 vs a Raspberry Pi, which if you buy the Zero W, will be just $10. You'll still need to buy the GPIO headers and some Dupont Wires (Google them), but it will be a lot cheaper. After CS 145 is done, you can still work on the RPI as a fully fledged computer, where the programmer... just sits there.

I kind of found it a waste that after the quarter is over, my guide will just rot in Piazza, never to be used again. So I decided to make this post in order to help future students.

Note: It's not a step by step guide. I can try to help you, but you will likely need to figure out some things on your own. It might be easier to do this on Linux, though I haven't tried it on Windows, Mac, or Windows Subsystem For Linux.

Guide:

One of the TA's mentioned that it's possible to use raspberry pi as a programmer. Here's the link:

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 1:

If you are programming your microcontroller with the raspberry pi and get: \`avrdude: AVR device not responding\`, first check your connections. If it's still not working, make sure the microcontroller is not using the 5V power supply and is instead using the raspberry pi's 3.3V pin. This is because the raspberry pi's GPIO pins can only go up to a max of 3.3V, which is not enough to register as a 1 with a 5V power supply

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 2:

In the first link ([adafruit.com](https://adafruit.com)), it talks about avrdude\_gpio.conf and how you have to add what GPIO pins you are using. Know that the GPIO pins that you input is not the same as the PIN number itself!

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my Makefile as well:

`default: build upload clean` 

`build:` 

`avr-gcc -Wall -Os -mmcu=atmega32 -o main.elf *.c` 

`upload:` 

`sudo avrdude -p atmega32 -C ~/avrdude_gpio.conf -c pi_1 -v -U flash:w:main.elf:e` 

`clean:` 

`rm main.elf`

`overclock:`

`sudo avrdude -p atmega32 -C ~/avrdude_gpio.conf -c pi_1 -v -U lfuse:w:0xff:m -U hfuse:w:0x99:m`

`defaultClock:`

`sudo avrdude -p atmega32 -C ~/avrdude_gpio.conf -c pi_1 -v -U lfuse:w:0xe1:m -U hfuse:w:0x99:m`

`disabledJTAGPlusOverclock:`

`sudo avrdude -p atmega32 -C ~/avrdude_gpio.conf -c pi_1 -v -U lfuse:w:0xff:m -U hfuse:w:0xd9:m`

`disabledJTAGPlusDefaultClock:`

`sudo avrdude -p atmega32 -C ~/avrdude_gpio.conf -c pi_1 -v -U lfuse:w:0xe1:m -U hfuse:w:0xd9:m`

&amp;#x200B;

Just drop it into your directory which has all the C files that you want to upload and it should work if you follow the adafruit link above. Make sure you have avr-gcc, avrdude, and avr-libc installed!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm on pace to only need 7 units next quarter to graduate.

I have done everything right. Never failed a class, always jumped on Webreg as soon as it would let me for the last four years. And yet I still can't get the class I need because it filled up before my enrollment window that opens *tomorrow at nine thirty AM*. CS 165 is full and 162 just might be by the time I get a chance to try for it, leaving me with no path to graduate with my specialization; maybe not at all if the other project courses also fill up. And they just might, because some classes that were supposed to be offered in Spring just, uh, **aren't** for some reason.

What the fuck was I supposed to do here? Who are these apparently thousands of people who have more right to take a class I need for my specialization than I do? How am I still nowhere near the front of the line when this is the last time I'm standing in it?

This university is a disaster. I was always told I'd be able to get the classes I want when I became a senior, and it looks like they were lying the whole time. Thanks a lot, UCI."

Now I’m halfway through Winter quarter and ACC has emailed me that I needed to submit a request to them to continue living here. 

This is really stressing me out because it seems really unfair I have to request for part time to begin with, and I already signed a lease so it’s also unfair that I might lose my housing halfway through the quarter?

I know this sounds weird but ever since high school (Like 3 Years Ago) I've been really trying to figure out the direction I want to take for my future career. I've finally settled on a major and minor I want to pursue, but I don't know many people who decided to take the career path I've decided to try and take. I guess my question is if it's okay to email one of my Professors and ask for some advice and what they did to become as successful as they are in the major they chose. I know it's a dumb question, but it definitely would help me out a ton to get advice from people who are as successful as they are. Thank you for any responses!

I got actual helpful replies and got 1 comment that I must admit really bothered me because it was so insensitive in my opinion considering the timing and sensitivity of the topic at hand. I can’t remember the user that commented it because I blocked them but it rose quiet an important issue;

Why is it to easy to be unkind over the internet? Behind that keyboard and that post and that comment and that profile is a real human being whom you know nothing about and what they’re experiencing. 

Why was it so easy and so accessible for that user to look at someone’s post about their illness and their fear of dying and concern over school and have their first instinctbe skepticism over whether or not they’re actually sick or sick enough, whether or not they’re seeking attention, and whether or not they’re ultimately lying? 

It’s not wrong to look at posts like that and think okay this doesn’t sound likely, but to willingly take time out of your day to hurt someone else is so deliberately cruel and I just don’t understand why something like that that can really be detrimental to someone, anyone holding on to their last straw has been so normalized.

I expected more from UCI students to be honest and I can’t help but feel disappointed and frankly hurt at that comment. Still. And I’m still sick and I wish they knew how terribly their undermining of my claims of ill health was misplaced and again, cruel"

I am currently a second year chemistry major trying to pick up a double major in psychological sciences. But I still have no clue what I am going to do with my life. I don’t like school, but I’m in it because i am forced to so I am not planning to attend graduate school willingly. 
The only reason why I chose chemistry was because I did good in it in high school and I understood it, so when doing college apps I had no idea what I was looking for or what I wanted but I knew I was somewhat good at chemistry. 2 years in I regret my decision every single day, and search the web for hours trying to look for a career with a chem degree. But really, nothing interests me. I tried switching majors, but again nothing interests, and I truly feel im not good at anything else but chemistry at this point. Also, the only reason I’m trying to pick up psci is to have a back up plan of some sort, but I obviously still don’t know what to do with it. 
I planned on transferring out and look for something that interested me in some other school, but I never found something that I truly felt was meant for me, until recently. I have a deep love for animals, but veterinary school did not catch my attention since I have no interest in being a doctor. Of course I found other careers that also specialize in some animal interaction or care, but I feel it is too late now to transfer out since it’d happen until my senior year. I do not want to be in school for more years than necessary, and worse stand back and watch how I wasted 3 years of my life in school for nothing (also I wouldn’t be able to afford school on my own once I run out of financial aid lol). 
Anyways tho, who knows what’ll be of me in the future, but I have a feeling it’ll be unhappy and full of regrets. Thanks for listening!"

Long story short, I graduated high school in 2014 and right after I went to a CC and I took my same lazy habits of HS with me and I did really poorly. Only classes I did good in were in programming classes which I actually enjoyed.

Anyway eventually in 2015 I stopped going because I didn't feel the motivation and just honestly didn't want to go to college at that time in my life. Throughout my time off, I kept up my programming and what not and was a freelancer.

In Summer of 2019, I had this random thought of not wanting to regret not getting my degree and I had found this new motivation to actually try and finish up my CC courses and transfer.

Since coming back I've had Bs and As, my last two semesters were 4.0s finishing up GE and transfer requirements. I've taken most if not all CS classes at my CC and gotten As in all of them if that matters.

But because of my initial poor grades in 2014 after HS, my cumulative GPA is around 3.38 right now. (still have about 2 semesters left or so)

I know that's low considering other's who apply with 3.8+.

I suppose I was wondering, does UC admissions take into account of cases like mine where I left school and then came back years later with new found motivation and did well?"

I've got an admit to the Master in Computer Science(MCS, not MS CS) program at UC Irvine. I wanted to connect with people who have already graduated/currently studying in the program. Some questions I want to ask:

1. Does the program cost a lot more than traditional masters programs? I understand that the tuition amounts to \~50k USD not including accommodation and other miscellaneous expenses. I just want to make sure that the amount is not high enough in comparison to the returns from available job opportunities that I end up taking a huge financial burden.
2. What is your review of the courses offered, and which courses do you like the most? I wish to study distributed systems, operating systems, and machine learning, so please let me know about your experience with these courses.
3. I understand getting job opportunities is more of a numbers game, and people have to apply via referrals, LinkedIn, and connections, but do recruiters differentiate between a MCS and a MS CS graduate?
4. Any things that you want a prospective Anteater to know before he joins campus?

But I am really gonna fail all 3 of my classes, does this mean Im gonna be put on Academic Probation? Will the classes that I have registered for be gone? I'm genuinely stumped on what to do. I know my parents are gonna be unreliably disappointed in me, there's nothing I can do about it. I wasted a lot of money by basically doing nothing all quarter/not being able to even start due to my having anxiety attacks pretty much every day for the past 3 months, but I got over it. I am not saying I don't feel bad, or not ashamed of how much I failed, but I can't do anything now but move forward. I feel like total and I hate my life so much rn, but I just don't want to think bout it, and move froward. I know when I am gonna be taking these classes again, but how is AP going to affect it?

TLDR: I am definitely gonna be on AP now right? What is the process of that like? How bad is it really, is it gonna show up on my transcript that I was on AP? Is AP just saying if you don't do well next quarter your gonna be kicked out? Anyone know how to deal with Anxiety?"

If a website stores them in plain text and lets them be stolen by someone else, then they will try to use them to access other sites, like your social media, banking sites, etc. 

How can you create strong passwords?

One way is to create a few that are customized to the site, start with a couple of words that don’t make sense:  

Method 1

Sciencemarshmallow -&gt; 5cI3ncemAr5ma110w -&gt; 5cI3ncemAr5ma110w2\*\_

Then you can add another character or characters to individualize it for an specific site:

5cI3ncemAr5ma110w2\*\_i   for Instagram for example.

Method 2

Another way would be to use just random characters without any meaning for each account, but having a secure way to remember them.

If a new site asks for a password I can blindly type WCFRgw#EFTGCFSsrhs$32 and  save a note to myself with the site name. The point of this is to avoid someone remembering such a long string, but have it available to copy paste it when is necessary 

Method 3

Use a password manager. If you prefer to pay a little to avoid having to deal with this, by all means.

I stick to methods 1 and 2, and so far so good."

Let's just say that my personal life is pretty much in tatters, and the education that I thought was engaging just a few months ago now seems completely distant to me. We are nearing the end of the quarter, and one of my courses has a professor who encourages students to reach out to him with any questions yet is not responding to any of my emails. The final is a 20 page paper and I am completely lost, and I just feel so hopeless because my mind is so terribly fogged up and focusing is really difficult. I admit, shamefully, that never before have I felt such derision for a professor and deep frustration at myself.

I'm really sorry if this kind of post is not allowed, I just feel like I'm going to be unable to pass any of my classes at this rate, and I don't know who to talk to. My parents shrug it off as me just being tired and they tell me to just rest my eyes for a bit. But I'm not physically tired and I don't know what to do.

* How big are the single dorms? I know that Middle Earth's single dorms are around 30 square feet larger than Mesa's, but I have also heard that the layouts vary depending on the hall phase. Can anyone describe to me how it was living in one? I am thinking of bringing small furniture (i.e. small bookshelves).
* If anyone knows, what halls are the ""Guild""/Interest in Video Games and Interest in Performing Arts themed residences located in? Even though I am living in a single, I would like to socialize and at least meet new people without the stressors of a roommate. Do those halls have singles or would I be placed in a General Interest hall?

o0v0u8,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/o0v0u8/a_warning_about_sage_corps_a_potentially/,"A warning about Sage Corps, a potentially predatory internship company",115,19,2021-06-15 19:52:22,"I wish I had known what I was getting into with Sage Corps. I’m a student in debt, and I lost $2000.

Sage Corps is an internship placement company that asks “top students” to pay thousands of dollars to do an unpaid internship. But I’m warning you that they are a potentially predatory company. If you really were a top student, why would you need to pay someone to do an unpaid internship?

First, Sage Corps hunts students down through their emails to university departments, asking them to spam their students. My university, unfortunately, did not foresee that I would become the company’s prey.

Their application process traps students. The interviewer only asked me a few behavioral questions, so there was no formal screening process—their claim of sending “top students” is shady. After the interview, I was asked to sign a binding contract and pay a $1000 initial deposit. But I had to sign this contract months before they placed me with a company. Little did I know that Sage Corps would later use the binding contract to extort $2000 from me.

During the two months following the contract signing, they helped me edit my resume—a service worth $5 on Fiverr.com—and gave me access to this “career accelerator program,” a compilation of around $100 worth of Udemy courses. The only thing I paid for with real value was the housing, provided through Sage Corps by a third-party, at $3000. 

But something unexpected happened related to COVID-19. When I asked Sage Corps if I needed a visa for my internship, they said I needed a CPT. So, I saw my university counselor, but he told me that since I was an international student who did his first year online and not in-person, I could not get CPT authorization. Sage Corps—despite knowing that I am a first-year international student doing online school—did not check beforehand whether I was eligible for the internship. Nothing on their website, unlike other companies detailing internship requirements, mentioned the need for a CPT. 

I informed Sage Corps I was not authorized to do an internship. They scheduled a call for me with the company’s CEO. He suggested I enter the US as a tourist to do the unpaid internship, pay for travel to and one-night stay in Canada after the internship, and return to the US to activate my F1 visa. Does this proposition, from a professional international internship company, sound legitimate?  

And the CEO failed to be reasonable and understanding throughout. When I asked for a refund because of circumstances that made it impossible to do the internship, he blamed me. He blamed me for circumstances caused by COVID-19. He even refused to give a refund minus Sage Corps’s incurred costs. 

I tried to reason with him through email, again and again. I let him know that my parents had to take loans to finance my education, so him taking thousands of dollars—for no mistake of my own—was a gunshot wound. 

More unreasonable was that he told me he had given us, this summer’s cohort, the wrong contract to sign. I was bound to a contract for a remote internship, which cost $2000. I never wanted to do a remote internship, and I made that clear from the start. 

So, even though he admitted the contract was a mistake, he said I had to do the online internship program or that he could only refund me $2000. He made me liable for his mistake, and he even tried to gaslight me. He said I failed to sign the new in-person-internship contract unlike the other students—but he never sent me this contract—and was obligated to pay $6800. He said he was making an “exception” to his policy by giving me $2000 of $4000 back. 

When I pleaded for at least the $3000 housing payment, he said Sage Corps has incurred costs like the resume editing and learning modules that have “already been activated and paid for.” 

But that was a lie. After refunding me $2000, he deactivated the learning modules. He could reverse the arrangement with Udemy all along. 

I’m a student in debt, and Sage Corps and its CEO tried to manipulate me to work without authorization, tried to gaslight me into thinking I’m to blame for COVID-19 circumstances, and bullied and lied to me. This is how a predator would behave: hunting me down, trapping me, deceiving and wounding me, and taking my money. 

Today, I’m $2000 more in debt because of Sage Corps. 

I hope my post will save you from Sage Corps and similar unethical companies and prevent you from making the same mistake I did: selling myself short and paying thousands for work. 

You can easily get an unpaid internship for free through Handshake at [joinhandshake.com](https://joinhandshake.com/) or LinkedIn."

TL;DR - I left on a plane flight for home, I left my keys with my boyfriend to watch my cat (a registered ESA). The key was left in the apartment and I had to argue with a supervisor about letting him into the apartment to at least pick up the cat so she wouldn’t starve. The supervisor literally told me to let the cat starve, and only after crying and begging him did he finally suggest that my bf grab the cat and nothing else. I also go into more detail on the yelp page for Plaza Verde if anyone is interested in knowing which supervisor it is.


The story - I left my key with my boyfriend to watch my cat while I was out of state for 5 days to visit family. He left the key inside while driving me to the airport and I got on my flight. After I get off my flight a couple hours later, my boyfriend was texting me panicking that he left the key inside the apartment. I called the front desk to get a replacement and explained my situation. 

The supervisor spoke down to me. He was very condescending and cold. He told me that under no circumstances can my boyfriend enter the apartment. I understand the policy, however I was explaining to him that I would be out of state for 5 days and my emotional support animal is inside the apartment. Know what he said? He said he couldn’t do anything and that the cat would just have to starve. I literally froze. I was so taken by this response… surely this dude could at least understand why it’s so important for someone to watch the apartment with my cat? I would be happy to provide a digital verification of my identity, like a video chat with my ID, a written letter from me and my guarantor, anything. But instead this man straight up tells me to let my cat starve.

It was absolutely devastating to have this kind of interaction with a supervisor, and there was nothing I could do because he said I had to be there in person but I was 10 hours away. Best case scenario is I book the next flight in a couple days and find my cat dead. This is an emotional support animal! She’s registered through UCI and ACC, so it baffles me why there seems to be no policies for situations with animals. 

I had to scream, beg and cry with this man FOR AN HOUR after I got off my flight before he begrudgingly suggested my boyfriend enter the apartment to only grab the cat and nothing else. Obviously that’s what we did since there was no other option.

If you’re curious about who the supervisor is, I left a yelp review for Plaza Verde."

As a warning, this post is also going to be very ranty and sloppy.

My problem really comes from my parents. I'm an only child to conservative Asian parents. I love them, but they're controlling in a lot of my social aspects (you can almost call it too loving?). Even as a kid, they'd hardly ever let me go to birthday parties at my friend's house or have skype calls with my friends. Even today, I hardly ever discord/skype call my friend and instead text because my parents don't like the idea of me having friends/friends who don't talk about school 24/7. If I do, they listen in and then criticize me about whatever we're talking about. They always talk down about Americans (including other Asians) and how no friend is worth anything here and won't do you any good. A lot about the stereotype that Americans hate their families after they turn 18 and all they do is get divorces and spend a lot of money. They do this in good faith and genuinely don't believe it's wrong. Anyone with stubborn conservative (asian) parents will know that trying to explain a concept like privacy or stereotyping is impossible.

I'll just admit that I'm pretty socially awkward. I don't blame this (entirely) on my parents and how they raised me, but I want to be put in an environment where I can better meet and see people like a dorm, join clubs, go out to eat with others, etc. Through highschool, I used honors/AP classes as well as my commute to school as an excuse to why I couldn't hang out or why I didn't go to dances/other events, but I don't want to do that anymore. I realize I can commute to uni and do all those things if I really wanted too, but that's what I thought in high school too. Instead of adding more on my plate, I want to make it easier for myself by just dorming.

My parents don't want me to dorm and say that it'll ""break"" me. Break meaning that I'll forget about my parents, flunk out of school, always be out with friends, and ruin my life and they've had friends whose children have done that. They also say that they need someone home because I'm an only child and they'd be lonely. That's heart warming and all, but I won't be at home forever and I honestly think it's selfish that they're holding me back from new experiences, being a whole person, etc (yes, I know. first world issues). I know a lot of people myself who just stay at home, play video games, have few friends, don't go out a lot etc and a lot of them are totally fine with who they are and what they want, but that's not me and I don't want to be like them. I've tried telling them to this, but now they're crying thinking I'm ""broken"" and I'm genuinely frustrated and surprised at how hard they're taking it because it isn't about them.

Just to add more details, I'd only dorm for a year so I can get used to school, be less stressed, make friends easier, join clubs/orgs easier, etc. I'm also trying to change majors and in STEM so I only have more to worry about while balancing classes and trying to find a job. If I did commute, it wouldn't be impossibly long (19/20 miles), but I think it'd be much more difficult to make friends. Now I feel like a shit son, but also someone who can't win.

Basically, I could add so much more to this post. It's basically something I should talk with a therapist instead, but idk."

I'll be applying as an Cognitive Science major and I want to go into UI/UX design or maybe front end dev  after graduation.

So my question is, how hard would it be to minor in Informatics once I get into UCI via TAG? From my research it seems like ICS 31 is the hardest class to get into and because of that, is the reason why people find it difficult to major or minor in anything in the Donald Bren School of ICS.

My high school included a lot of CSU classes, so I have a CSU transcript from high school. If you look at the classes, they're pretty basic and you might guess they'd transfer anywhere. Things like bio classes, Spanish classes, etc. 

However, on [Assist.org](https://Assist.org) there doesn't seem to be an articulation agreement between my CSU and my CC (regarding how CSU classes would transfer to the CC) and there's no articulation agreement between the CSU and UCI.

So, my basic questions are 

(1) Who decides what counts for IGETC (specifically whether the CSU credits count)? Is it the CC? Is it UCI after I apply?

(2) Who decides whether my credits (particularly the 26 CSU credits from high school) are UC transferable credits? Can my CC tell me? Or is it UCI after I apply?

My concern, of course, is somehow the CSU courses won't count, and I won't have my 60 UC transferable credits and won't get TAG. From high school I have 26 CSU credits, 18+ AP credits, and 4 UC credits from a summer program. So with that plus the 30 I plan to take at my CC this year, I should have plenty, but I'd like to find out for sure. 

Here's what I already did to try to find my own answer:  


* Assist -- no help, because the lack of articulation agreements. 
* The UCI website doesn't have anything I could find. 
* My CC website says it will only review my transcripts from other colleges if I'm graduating with a CC degree (which I wasn't planning to do... but should I be doing that maybe? Is it the CC or UCI who will decide about the CSU credits? UCI right? But the CC will decide about some of them if they certify me for IGETC right? This gets confusing.)
* And UC-TAP will let me put in my CSU classes, but it doesn't seem to have a mechanism to evaluate them. So how can I know? At what point will those be evaluated?
* This spring I made an online 15-minute appointment with a UC counselor (through UC-TAP I think), specifically to ask if these CSU classes could be evaluated please, so I'd know if they would be UC transferable, and that person told me ""no"" (no? how do I find out then? the person couldn't tell me).

I just need a clearer understanding of how the CSU credits from high school work, so I can be sure I'm meeting all the TAG requirements. Thanks so much for your help and for reading a long post!"

Now, from what I’ve understood before in the past, when you waitlist both a lecture and a discussion, your position on the discussion waitlist determines how far you are from getting into the class. However, I noticed that when I waitlisted both classes, I had a waitlist position on both the lecture course (position was #3) and the discussion course (position was #5). About a week ago, I received a notification from web reg that the lecture course was added to my schedule, but didn’t receive anything about the discussion being added.

Specifically, i’ve realized how unfair that there’s NINE random groups. obviously it makes SO much harder to even get classes you want/ need.

i’m in group 9 and like it’s giving me so much anxiety and discouragement knowing as a biological sciences major that i won’t get good classes. and freshman year is supposed to make you feel adjusted and comfortable yet i know being last is a MAJOR disadvantage for my group 9 or even groups in general. 

sorry in advance if this sounds childish to complain about. ofc i am super happy and blessed that i got in, but obv picking classes can be a big deal. i just hope people understand where i’m coming from about these split groups. like it started mid july and my date to pick is august 10:/

Although I know that college is different from high school, I just want to say that my brother's high school already had 2 confirmed cases of COVID on their 2nd day of school. Even though UCI is going to have everyone get a vaccine, the Delta variant can still spread to ppl with vaccines. Who knows while the Delta variant is spreading, Lambda might get more serious and I believe there is a Gamma variant as well so that might screw things up.

Failure to comply with the COVID-19 Vaccine Policy will also [result in a loss of campus privileges](https://zotmail.oit.uci.edu/ClickMessage.aspx?LinkId=6ce75531-7f2f-4818-a2cc-a71fe4fd1c86&amp;ZotMailId=KNkXX2THyRUFyj1XmhnViA==) including, but not limited to, loss of access to the UCI’s WiFi system, a registration hold on your records for Winter 2022, and a referral for disciplinary action.

**Start Submitting the Daily Symptom Check-ins:** Respond to the [Daily Symptom Check](https://zotmail.oit.uci.edu/ClickMessage.aspx?LinkId=3836ce25-7a39-4106-aa91-686bd8c13a43&amp;ZotMailId=f2JbDnodeTbZ64pM5kFkfQ==) email or [install the ‘Now-Mobile’ app](https://zotmail.oit.uci.edu/ClickMessage.aspx?LinkId=a30610f8-9b22-4f7d-afd3-683ecfea2606&amp;ZotMailId=4gXzDXhpmc7t65joLmLTFA==) on your smartphone. These daily checks will continue during the fall quarter and are required for all students regardless of vaccination status. 

**ZotPass Basics:** Starting in the Fall, your [ZotPass](https://zotmail.oit.uci.edu/ClickMessage.aspx?LinkId=1fa10c7a-918c-4def-921b-a8b0d94ed93f&amp;ZotMailId=gBYfojA8g0FtcupDAuvQXg==) status will take into consideration your vaccination status, among other factors, and could impact your mobility on campus. UCI students will be required to show their ZotPass to gain access to some campus locations, including dining commons and the Anteater Recreation Center. It tracks compliance with University Policies around COVID-19 prevention, including completion of the Daily Symptom Check, Vaccine Policy compliance, and COVID-19 testing requirements. More information on the ZotPass will be sent out prior to the start of Fall 2021.

# If you are a graduate student:

**COVID-19 Testing:** All students, regardless of vaccination status, who moved in to Graduate and Family Housing on or before September 6, are required to obtain a COVID-19 test at the UCI Student Center on one of the following dates: Sept 7, 8, 9 and 10, and Sept 13 and 14. Schedule your test on the [Student Health Portal](https://zotmail.oit.uci.edu/ClickMessage.aspx?LinkId=eab3ccc8-5836-41f7-8e1a-9ba358dd38f1&amp;ZotMailId=luk26IgYiQ6D7zgRe+vTeA==). All students moving in after September 7th should schedule a test within 48 hours of their arrival. 

**SEQUESTRATION requirement for unvaccinated students on arrival to campus:** Residents who are not fully vaccinated for COVID-19 (including contract holders who do not upload their vaccination record to the [UCI Student Health Porta](https://zotmail.oit.uci.edu/ClickMessage.aspx?LinkId=20b688f5-76b5-4abf-b79b-7604e4923224&amp;ZotMailId=X9TbQ+OGi+XCr6Evj7ho2Q==)l) will be required to sequester in their unit for a minimum of seven days after move-in or until they receive two negative on-campus COVID-19 tests. They will need to test within 48 hours of arrival and receive two negative COVID tests with the second being no less than five days after the first. 

# If you need to be vaccinated still:

if you are currently in the area, the **Student Health Center has vaccines available**. To make a vaccine appointment, call SHC’s appointment line at 949-824-5304. If you start your two dose vaccine series now, due to required spacing of the doses, you will not be able to complete both doses prior to the September 6, 2021 compliance deadline, but please upload your first dose documentation to the Student Health portal. Doing so will satisfy this initial compliance requirement, but to be in full compliance you must upload your second dose documentation as soon as you are able to receive it.

# Recap:

* For those who have complied with the COVID-19 Vaccine Policy, Housing assignments for the Residence Halls and Arroyo Vista are scheduled to be emailed on the evening of September 7th.
* Housing assignments **will NOT be sent to students who are out of compliance with the COVID-19 Vaccine Policy**. (Your housing contract is still secure, but you will not get your assignment until you comply with the COVID-19 Vaccine Policy.)
* Move-in information will be available on the [Housing Website](https://zotmail.oit.uci.edu/ClickMessage.aspx?LinkId=7477f0b4-306b-47c2-8201-761ab3e0223d&amp;ZotMailId=u8/BoUp+DDmSbLilu6lf2Q==) beginning on September 1st, including Community Guides and general information about preparing for move-in and Move-in Day procedures.
* [Face-coverings](https://zotmail.oit.uci.edu/ClickMessage.aspx?LinkId=34935564-4478-48c6-b20e-bb30f248d541&amp;ZotMailId=Ecq2M1rsgLMkqJs2TkMbJg==) will be required at move-in and throughout fall quarter in indoor spaces. 
* Starting in the Fall, your [ZotPass](https://zotmail.oit.uci.edu/ClickMessage.aspx?LinkId=1fa10c7a-918c-4def-921b-a8b0d94ed93f&amp;ZotMailId=gBYfojA8g0FtcupDAuvQXg==) status will take into consideration your vaccination status, among other factors, and could impact your mobility on campus."

As you might know now, roommate assignments are out. I had a panic attack after seeing that the group of friends I was going to call roommates was replaced by names of people I have never met. 

We are set on the  2 Bed - 2 Bath Shared A apartment. We made our decision a little over 2 months ago. As an incoming transfer, this is very disappointing and honestly, scary. I have gotten to know my 3 roommates over the past 2 months and being able to communicate with them and bond, I was super excited to room with these guys.

We have been coordinating for the past month on what exactly we're bringing to the apartment so we don't have to spend more money on something if someone already has it and is willing to share. As well as dividing up things to buy that are necessary for the apartment like a shower curtain and a shower rug.

A couple of us weren't planning on bringing any extra help since we agreed we were all going to help each other bring the other's stuff in when we arrive at PV. It was perfect!

My move-in date is tomorrow and I'm freaking out because I didn't think this would happen.

Sorry for the rant everyone, but how do 4 people who agreed to room together on the Room Sync app 2 months ago for our 4-person apartment get separated?

2 of my roomies were able to stay together but the other 2 people with them are randoms and one of those roomies moves in today. My other roomie and I were each separated into different apartments with 3 other random people.

Has this happened before? Does anyone know if this can be fixed? I feel like crying. :(

Sorry to anyone else who is disappointed by their assignments, I know how you feel. I hope there is a solution to all this.

Thank you for reading."

I am a new transfer student and will be commuting to campus. Now that I have seen the syllabi for my classes I noticed that I have a mandatory online class 10 minutes before a mandatory in person class. I live over 30 minutes away so I will have to be one campus when I am doing my live online class. In the live online course we are put into small group discussions so I won’t be able to sit in a library since I will be talking. Does anyone know if there is a good place to go or should I just do the class while in my car? Thanks so much!

I am an incoming transfer student who is currently living in Plaza Verde. I brought my car with me and plan to get a pass to park here in the PV and ECPS structure, however, I'm not super sure about the parking situation for the campus itself.

Being a drama major, my classes happen on the other side of campus, so my question is, where would I be able to safely park for my classes? 

I can't buy a parking permit to park in the Mesa Structure for instance because I'm living in PV. So, I was thinking about parking in the lot of the Taco Bell in University Center? The spots say there's parking for up to 2 hours.

I would also have no issues taking the Anteater Express to save on gas. It seems like either the M line or V line would be best. What line would you suggest I take?

23 minutes of walking definitely isn't a bad idea either! I'm just not sure how up I am for that haha!

Well, today (morning of 9/18) I checked my financial aid on a whim and found out that they are not offering *any* of the $5000 subsidized loan anymore, only the *full* $7500  unsubsidized (which I have not accepted yet).  

Before this change, I had already done everything to accept my loans, including accepting my aid on the uci website and done all the MPN stuff on [fafsa.gov](https://fafsa.gov). I'm not dropped from my fall classes, so I don't think I have to accept my aid again after the change.

But my primary concern is this. I uploaded the PDF of my lease agreement like just now, but with the lockdown I know there's no way it will be checked and my living situation changed on the day of fall disbursement (9/20). What will most likely happen is that my living situation will be corrected, but by that time loans will already have been disbursed. 

If the loan offer changes back to subsidized + unsubsidized (most likely after loan disbursement) will I be able to accept and receive those loans? Or, because it is past the disbursement date, will I not receive the subsidized + unsubsidized loans for fall, but I will for winter + spring? Or will I not receive those loans for the whole year unless I accept the full $7500 unsubsidized loans now?

• All buses are full or near capacity due to a lack of staff. While some lines (one or two?) have been added in recent weeks, staffing remains critically low. 

• As of a few weeks ago, only 30 out of the 90 drivers required for full service capacity have been hired. 

• Drivers have been expected to take on the work of three people (which is not possible due to space limitations in each bus), and as a result, have been the subjects of passengers’ anger and frustration when buses are too full to operate normally and service all riders. 

• Drivers are only being paid $18 - $22 an hour. Some might say this is a lot compared to the minimum wage of $14, but in my opinion, BOTH are far too low for the cost of living in Irvine. Especially for bus drivers, who are expected to be drug tested, have a pristine driving record, and a Class B or C license to boot. The job seems, to me, harder and more stressful than working in retail or fast food—especially given the current circumstances… and at least in fast food jobs, you’re given tips and free food in many cases. Imagine driving a bus full of 40-50 people knowing that not many of them are pleased about being squeezed into a bus like sardines, and being expected to handle all sorts of complaints and abuse from students who are angry they can’t leverage a campus service they pay for via fees. 

• On that last point — whatever happened to COVID-19 guidelines? Aren’t we all supposed to be masking indoors (even when it doesn’t make sense, such as when students are doing close-combat sports such as Brazilian jiu-jitsu)? Why is it OK for 40+ students to be packing onto a single bus, with hardly enough room to breathe, when UCI pretends to be super strict on COVID in other instances? To me, the buses act as the veins of the UCI campus, bringing students from far and wide to their classes. If someone with COVID steps on the Anteater Express, they’re exposing the virus to far more students than necessary due to overcrowding. Then, those students depart the bus and potentially expose more students in their classes. Rinse and repeat with every single bus that passes through campus. Why let such a critical point falter with regards to COVID safety? 

• Finally, UCI doesn’t have any issues opening its pursestrings for executive staff. While it might be argued that the best of the best deserve to be paid in accordance with their skills, Gillman is pulling in $562,256 a year in base salary—not to mention all of the benefits, including free housing, he gets as a senior member of the executive staff. For comparison, someone working part time (20hrs/week) at the “competitive” wages offered by the Anteater Express would make $18,720 annually… just enough to cover rent on a tiny studio, if you got lucky enough to find one for $1500/mo. 

So, what’s my point here? In a word, I think now is a great time for the 30 student drivers of the Anteater Express to band together and strike. 

It doesn’t have to be forever, or even for more than a week; even a few days of completely halted services would be enough to spook UCI. It’s been too long since this university (which, to me, resembles a corporation more than anything) was reminded that its workers are living, breathing people who aren’t happy letting themselves be pushed around for scarce above minimum wage driving in unsafe, overcrowded buses during a pandemic. 

What I would demand, at the very least, if I were a worker on the Anteater Express today:

1. Minimum wage of $25 an hour for student drivers to account for the skill the job requires, as well as the stress it entails;

2. Expanded hiring efforts at *whatever price point is necessary* to recruit drivers who already have their Class C licenses. This will ease up the shortage of buses for the time being until more student drivers can be trained and onboarded at more enticing wages;

3. Stricter guidelines on what a “full bus” means during a pandemic—hint for UCI: the answer is not “as many people as can physically fit inside”;

4. Additional benefits to attract talent, including potential housing stipends/reductions, free meals at university dining halls, etc. 

I understand that it’s very unlikely for a strike to actually go through, and that if it did, many students would become even angrier at drivers for “ruining students’ ability to get to class”. 

But I ask you: Is it better to put up with the conditions you’re seeing today—overcrowded buses, long wait times, bus drivers who are stressed out, not as happy as they could be, and trying their best not to burn out given the demands currently being placed on their shoulders—for who knows how long, or is it better to go without public transportation for a few days to allow the people who keep the Anteater Express running to express their discontent with the way UCI is treating them?

I can’t make the decision for anyone here, but I urge you to consider the points I’ve laid out in this post, especially if you are a driver for the Anteater Express. It is deeply upsetting to me that UCI is taking such extreme advantage of students who are just trying to get by and help students who aren’t able to secure housing within walking distance of UCI, and it worries me that a lack of consequences (ie, a strike) will inform UCI’s hiring decisions going forward. 

If nobody makes serious, lasting damage to their bottom line (making money at any cost to students), nothing will change.

Thank you for reading. I welcome feedback and comments from the community and from drivers themselves.

- $950/mo (includes utilities)

- Available starting Dec 1

- Part of a 4 bd house

- Furnished

- Shared bathroom (with one other person who's very clean)

- Access to kitchen, backyard, living room, etc.

- Driveway parking

- Very quiet

- About 30 minute commute to UCI

I currently have about 98 units, and I'm a little worried that they won't accept my application for change of major, because it states that ""Students with more than 60 units will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and may not be admitted to the major."" or ""Students with more than 90 units will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and may not be admitted to the major."".

I feel that this is because people feel like they have a right to criticize something where no voice and/or personality is attached to it. 

This leads me to an important point: stand out so much to the admissions officers that they feel like rejecting you is equivalent to shooting your friend. 

Don’t be afraid to be informal and use parentheses and such. In fact, your essays should read like this post.

I'm graduating this quarter so this final (other than commencement) is the last thing I'll be doing at UCI. This feeling is different than the one I felt when graduating high school because back then I knew that at UCI I would still be under the wings of my parents, doing the same thing (studying), and not worrying about much other than getting good grades, extracurriculars (internships, clubs, etc.), and having fun. 

But now that I'm graduating from UCI, I know that I'm not going to be under the wings of my parents since I'm moving to another state for the job I acquired. I'll be paying my own bills and making my own choices. I'll be living alone for the first time in my life and it's a bit scary knowing this. 

I didn't have the best time at UCI. I came as a freshman in 2019 and during Spring Quarter (I believe), COVID took over and I was at home for more than a year. So I only got to fully experience UCI for a year and even when in-person I felt inactive. I wasn't very active in clubs nor was I able to meet anyone that I could call a true friend. However, I'm still glad I came here because just the career center alone made me feel more confident in my future, and while not all, there were definitely professors that were really great and loved what they were doing which made me love being in their class. 

Well, I just wanted to say this out loud somewhere so thanks for reading. For everyone doing their finals, good luck to you all and I know that all of you will do exceptionally!"

And if they do so and it conflicts with other prescheduled events (finals, plane flight home, etc.)?

Edit: been hearing that some professors made there finals available through a Google Form and others have just emailed the final to them to take. Again, it is purely dependent on the professor and their resourcefulness"

After some nasty tumbles from the transition to online learning because of Covid-19, I've spent the last year desperately fighting to meet the normal progress requirements, and I. AM. SO. TIRED. OF. IT. Why is it so rigid? 

I'm in Junior year. Chem 51B is a corequisite for Bio 98 and Chem51lb, so I HAVE to pass chem 51A if I want any chance to complete the org chem and bio series to meet normal progress requirements to stay in this major. 

There's nothing I can really do now except hope that whatever bs I put on those papers and the curve (if any) gets me over the c- line.

&amp;#x200B;

If there's any consolation for me, it's that most (if not all) of the courses that I've taken for Bio Sci will transfer over in some way to my backup option for a major: Earth System Sciences."
