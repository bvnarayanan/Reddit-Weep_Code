I would hope that most people at Tech understand the devastating impact this will have on those affected not being able to visit family abroad because they will be denied re-entry in to the US, or cannot continue to study/work at Tech because they are unable to gain entry in the country.  This is a dark and sad time in the history of our nation as the current administration has just enacted the most racist act in recent memory.  It's important to note that not a single terrorist attack on US soil since 9/11 was carried out by someone from abroad.  Every attack was carried out by radicalized US citizens already here.  If you supported Trump, then I hope you feel deeply ashamed and understand that this country was founded on the principles of liberty and freedom for ALL.  I for one will continue to support anyone seeking refuge in our nation and resist the continued hatred and institutional racism that has taken hold at the White House.

Edit: I would also like anyone on this subreddit that is from one of the nations that is affected or is a practicing Muslim to know this:  You are appreciated and valuable to us.  Do not let the hatred and bigotry of a few cause you to feel afraid or unwanted.  Hang in there and things will get better if we have hope.  If you cannot return home and need a place to live while you study, I will open my doors and do everything I can to ensure you have the same access to life and liberty as everyone else."

During the semester break, I was informed of the sudden and tragic death of an undergraduate student, Alexander Prinzi. This has been devastating news to the Georgia Tech community. Alex’s family shared that he passed away in a snorkeling accident while on vacation in Jamaica. For members of the School Electrical and Computer Engineering, for faculty who had Alex enrolled in their classes, the brothers of Sigma Phi Epsilon and for all who knew him personally, the shock and grief are particularly acute.
  
Georgia Tech is committed to providing resources for the mental, emotional, and physical well-being of our entire campus community. Please remember that multiple services and resources in support of the community during this time of loss and grief:

• The Georgia Tech Counseling Center (http://www.counseling.gatech.edu) is staffed by psychologists and mental health counselors. They offer brief, confidential counseling and crisis intervention services to students. The Counseling Center also offers an after-hours on-call counselor to speak and consult with students in crisis. In addition, they sponsor a series of workshops for managing stress.

• Stamps Health Services (http://health.gatech.edu/services/Pages/Psychiatry.aspx) is open to students and their spouses. Students interested in scheduling an appointment may call 404-894-2585 or visit the second floor of the Stamps Health Services Building.

• Division of Student Life and the Office of the Vice President and Dean of Students has a referral option if you are concerned about a student (http://www.studentlife.gatech.edu).

• The Employee Assistance Program provides free consultations for all benefits-eligible employees and their families (hwb.gatech.edu/eap).

• The Georgia Crisis &amp; Access Line (1-800-715-4225) is staffed with professional social workers and counselors 24 hours per day, every day, to assist those with urgent and emergency needs. www.mygcal.com.

 
It is our hope that anyone who needs these services will be able to take full advantage of them. At times like these, we are reminded of the importance of coming together in support, understanding, and care for one another.

I wanted you to see the message from the University System of Georgia (USG) below, and reassure everyone that we here at Georgia Tech are closely monitoring the situation. In addition to the information in the message below, we will soon send a message to all F and J visa students and scholars with additional information regarding any questions they might have.

Regards,

BP

Dear presidents,

Recent regulatory and policy changes impacting international travel and visa holders will likely result in questions among our students, faculty and staff.  Specifically, the President recently issued an Executive Order that limits nationals from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen from entering the country for 90 days, and places additional restrictions on individuals seeking entry pursuant to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. The U.S. Department of State has issued the following notice at https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en.html regarding the President’s Executive Order, and we will continue to closely monitor for any additional updates and guidance from federal officials.

As you know, the safety and well being of our campus communities is our university system's top priority, and it is important that we remain in close communication as new information and direction from the State Department becomes available in the coming days.
 
Our System Office will coordinate closely with your international education offices, which will continue to serve as the primary point of contact for your campus communities. Please advise your international students, staff, and faculty to consult with your international education office for any individual guidance, as they would with travel- or study-abroad related concerns and questions.
 
Tammy Rosner, Director of International Education, will continue to be the System Office's point of contact for any questions your international education offices may have through the spring semester. Ms. Rosner can be contacted by email at tammy.rosner@usg.edu or by phone at 470-218-1744.
 
Meanwhile, we will continue to assess the impact on our students, staff, and/or faculty, and to provide you with updated information and assistance.

From play-calling to a horribly timed sack, but I'm here with irrefutable evidence for why the Falcons lost.

Exhibit A:
https://twitter.com/UGAfootballLive/status/820485854191882240

Here, we have Jacob Eason, QB of u(sic)ga at the Falcons-Seahawks match-up in the NFC Divisional Round. Notice the Seahawks shirt. Now we can chalk that up to him being from Washington but...

Exhibit B:
https://twitter.com/DudeYouCrazy/status/823285214550065153

Yes, that's the same Jacob Eason in a Packers jersey. This picture was taken at the NFC Championship victory of the Falcons over the Packers. It turns out Eason isn't so good at being victorious in Georgia. He's managed to cheer for both losing sides against the Falcons. And then...

Exhibit C:

https://twitter.com/skinnyqb10/status/823304160007352320

Eason bends the knee, however in an unfortunate case for the Falcons, this brings a jinx on the team. As we all know, the Falcons go on to lose after embarrassing Brady and Belichick in the 1st half of the Super Bowl.

Based on the evidence above, I believe the dwags have no choice but to dismiss Eason from uga so as to allow the Falcons to continue their reign. "

The owner of this scooter is violating this law from the viewpoint of any reasonable person. It is clearly disturbing the peace of every resident of GT West Campus and the adjacent Home Park Community.

I drove to campus in the afternoon hoping to stop by my lab for a few hours. I knew that there is a game so chace of parking is slim but I thought maybe I will try my luck at the visitor parking outside of W2. I was told by an PTS employee to pay $20 or turn around. I didn't know that he wanted me to make a U-turn on Ferst Drive so I told him I will make a U-turn in the lot (because there are lots of cars on Ferst Dr and I don't want to block them pulling the U-turn). As I pulled into the lot he freaked out, started yelling like I just robbed him and had his guys stop me on the road, asked me to back out onto Ferst Drive and leave. Geez, what a big deal? You think I would sneak in and leave my car here? Well I live close enough to campus so I went home and change to my scooter, which is what I usually use to get to work. No big deal right?
*******************

I ride a scooter to campus on a daily basis and hold a motorcycle parking permit which gives me access to park at any motorcycle parking areas. As far as I know there isn't any zoning for motorcycle permits and the PTS email last week didn't mention anything about motorcycle permits.

So I attempted to park on my usual spot outside of student center deck (outside of W2 garage) but was refused entrance by a different PTS employee/contractor. I explained to him that I hold a motorcycle permit which is separate from annual auto/carpool permit and was not mentioned in the email notice from PTS nor is it inside the W2 parking garage. I can even see from a distance that the motorcycle parking area is vacant. The person radioed someone inquiring whether motorcycles permit holders should be excluded from this parking area because he ""does not know"" and was told no. 

I then asked him where can I find alternative parking for my scooter because there is no mentioning of parking arrangements/guidelines specifically for motorcycles from the PTS email, and I was refused entrance to my usual parking areas (CRC deck and Ferst Dr outside student center). The person then told me ""I don't know. I am not with Georgia Tech. You should know the campus better than me"". I laughed at his response because he was wearing a GT shirt and told him that I he should radio PTS and give me some directions since the email contained no information regarding motorcycles. At that time the previous PTS employee who was yelling at me when I drove my car appeared and personally identified me as ""the same guys in the red car right""? and told me ""you are not going to park here today"" and shouted ""Go"". This is when I felt that he was personally targeting me and is treating me like someone who wants to ""cheat"" him out of paying for parking and cause him trouble. I just wanted to park a few hours for god sake is this kind of treatment really necessary?

I can understand that a campus event will cause some level of inconvenience for regular PTS customers, but I cannot fathom the utter lack of competence and respect demonstrated by these PTS employees/contractors. Not only was I unable to use the service for which I paid, I also did not receive any useful information on alternative arrangements and I was practically shunned away. I do not wish to engage in the discussion on whether the practice of using parking infrastructures paid by our parking and transportation fees and permit fees (https://pts.gatech.edu/where-do-pts-dollars-go) for monetary gain is ethical, but at least offer us who are inconvenienced by this practice some respect and help, and a more informative email notice for motorcycle permit holders, instead of ""I don't know where you can park. Pay or leave"" type of response that leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.

Now here comes the million dollar question - **Is PTS literally Hitler?**"

Also working part time to pay college plus doing 16 credits. with all of this together i kinda started to loose it. And lately im having weird ideas while waiting for the train at marta and looking down from high buildings. Im kinda scared of myself.  I believe i might also have ptsd (might not need a doctor diagnosis...). How well is the counseling ceter at GT? I saw too many posts saying that they dont help and it gets worse with the.  Also their gt page mentioned that i have to fill 40 minutes worth of papers.. also is it free if not (sorry for asking) how much per session? Thank you.. Have a great saturday



UPDATE: I visited the counseling center today, the paperwork was fine. They asked questions they had to. I got contacted by a counselor after I finished my paperwork. We talked for an hour. He told me that my situation is way over their head and advised me to go talk to the stamps psychiatry (to perscribe me medicine) and also gave a list of outside counselors. At this point I'm not sure what to do. I feel physical pain. Probably will go to the stamps psychiatry to talk more. I did not experience something like this before.

63iekv,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/63iekv/what_to_do_if_a_tornado_hits/,What to do if a tornado hits,116,18,2017-04-04 18:05:44,"As someone who has literally been hit by a tornado and grew up in Alabama, I realized during the tornado scare last Fall that many people didn't know what to do. Where I grew up, we had tornado drills in school (similar to how people from CA have earthquake drills), so I always just assumed these things were a given.

I thought I'd write up a few quick pointers of advice, in case we find ourselves in this situation again tomorrow. If you don't know this stuff by heart, it's never a bad idea to catch up. You never know when it could save a life.

* When to panic

**Don't panic now**, as we just have a forecast suggesting there could be a threat tomorrow. It could be the real deal, or it could be a bust like Monday.

Get a weather app that can show you a radar map. On the day of, you can watch the map to get an idea of what is coming. Green is light rain, yellow and red is the stronger stuff. Note that red on the radar does not mean tornado, many times it is just heavy rain with increased wind.

Ideally your app will also show National Weather Service (NWS) watches and warnings, either in a list or on the map.

* Throughout the day

If the conditions are ripe for a tornado to touch down, the NWS will issue a **tornado watch**. In my app, this appears as a yellow box on the map. A watch doesn't mean imminent danger, but if you fall under a watch, it's a good idea to either get inside or stay close to a sturdy building you could get to quickly if necessary.

* If a tornado touches down

If a tornado touches down, the NWS will issue a **tornado warning** in the surrounding area. This is when sirens will go off throughout the city and GTENS will likely be activated. My app shows this as a red box on the map.

If you fall under a tornado warning, stop and go to a safe place immediately. This means, for starters, inside a sturdy building. Most campus buildings and residence halls are sturdy, with concrete walls and steel frames. Less sturdy would be some houses in home park, smaller greek houses, etc.

Once inside, **get away from windows**, i.e. don't stand in the Klaus atrium and gaze. Go to the lowest floor, and innermost room you can find. Grab a textbook or something to cover your head in case the building gets hit.

* If a tornado hits you

Obviously you'll know if this applies to you, as it will be very loud. Crouch down as low as possible and try to cover your head if possible.

**If you're outdoors or in a car**, get out and find a ditch or the lowest point on the ground you can, then lay down as flat as possible and cover your head.

Just because the rumbling stops does not mean you're in the clear. The center of the tornado can be very calm. Wait an extra few minutes and check a map before emerging to inspect.

My last tornado encounter: April 27, 2011. It passed through Birmingham right as I was getting ready to go to school. We lost roughly 25 trees on my lot, one of which fell on my car. Some of my classmates lost a lot more. The storm later went on to hit University of Alabama and killed 44 people. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QBsc_IXg8U)"

I have never been so categorically blind-sighted by any class than this, and frankly I am reluctant and embarrassed with myself to even be making this post- I have reached out to the professor and to TA's (and the CS Help desk), but it's been an experience not unlike trying to lead a horse to water, that just will not drink. Having never had basic programming experience I can understand the concepts covered in class and usually understand the clicker questions presented in class, but I seize-up and spend hours on even the most basic homework tasks, going nowhere. I've been spending at least two to three hours per day for the past two weeks trying book exercises and looking up Youtube tutorials trying to learn independently, because I genuinely do not want to mooch off of others. I am infuriated with myself that I continue to NOT understand this- I am afraid that if I do not seek some form of tutorship, that I may have a mental breakdown.

I’ve run out of HOPE credits, had to prolong my graduation (CS 1371 is the single requirement I need to graduate as an undergrad- I've taken it before and had to withdraw for the same problem I'm currently having), my apartment lease, and couldn’t partake in an internship this summer largely because of this lingering class requirement. I feel even worse that I have been accepted to my engineering school’s Masters Program here at Tech and am set to start in Fall of this year, have an outstanding GPA and can speak three languages, but this festering incompatibility I’ve had has gotten under my skin to a degree that I feel frustrated, and ashamed, and that I am a fraud. I REALLY want to understand and overcome this problem and am not digging for pity points or for someone to mooch off of; so any advice would be greatly appreciated, as I know that this class has been extremely easy for some, and debilitating for others such as myself."

This law will allow individuals with a valid Georgia Weapons Carry License (GWL) to carry a concealed handgun onto campus with the following prohibited areas:

* Buildings or property used for athletic sporting events; 
* Student housing, including but not limited to dormitories, fraternity and sorority houses; 
* Any preschool or childcare space; 
* Any room or space being used for classes related to a college and career academy or other specialized school; 
* Any room or space used for classes in which high school students are enrolled through a dual enrollment program, including, but not limited to, classes related to the “Move on When Ready Act”; 
* Any faculty, staff, or administrative offices or rooms where disciplinary proceedings are conducted.

We're here with Students for Concealed Carry (SCC), an nationwide organization that supports the implementation of legal campus carry for concealed handgun license holders.  A little about us:

Robert Eagar, Southeast Regional Director of SCC and an Assistant State Director for Georgia:  I founded Georgia Tech's chaper of SCC back in 2012 and have been on the ground every year campus carry legislation has been filed in the state legislature.  I got out in 2013, so I've handed off the reigns of the campus organization.

Ja'Quan Taylor, Campus Leader:  I spend much of my time recruiting new members and educating students on their 2nd Amendment rights. I also serve as the President of the Georgia Tech Marksmanship Club which promotes firearms safety, discussion, and fun outside of the political spectrum. 

Now that you know who we are, we're here to answer any questions you might have about HB 280 and campus carry!  Remember, we're not lawyers, so please consult an attorney regarding any legal advice for carrying on campus.

-Just finished my third year. 2.91 GPA.

-No zell, hope, other scholarships, subsidized loans, or help from parents.

-50k in debt with 6.5% interest rate.

-Changed majors 3 times (Biomed, Econ, NRE) and trying to change to ME since Westinghouse went bottom up. The school requires a 3.0 to switch.

-My grades are inflated by a 4.0, 19 credit semester in Econ. I've also dropped a ton of classes.

-I'll be in school for at least two more full years, more if this summer doesn't go well. Being a seventh year (kill me) is a possibility if I can't change to ME.

-Taking 3 summer courses (Diff EQ, Dynamics, Circuit), Dynamics is going well but I failed the first tests in the other two. My math midterm is 40% of my grade and I failed. 

 - This was all this week, and I vomited an hour ago thinking about the ramifications.

-Diff EQ is a prereq for every single course I'm registered for next semester.

**Personal Situation:** 

-Complete social isolation, which explains why I'm asking this here.

- BTW socializing won't help. I have regular, severe panic attacks that are not related to socializing but have made people see me as a freak. 

-I'm wrapped up in my head almost all day, usually suffocating in negative thoughts.

-No idea what I would do. I'm taking forever to make it through college, too unstable to deal with people, and I've failed at manual labor twice before.

-No substance or alcohol use. Used to be on medication but I started wanting to kill myself.

-I am not using campus services anymore. The last three years I've not found them helpful.

**Conclusion**
After reevaluating my goals and situation in life I have started to consider dropping out. This is to avoid debt and to stop wrecking my psyche. In a sense, I am defeated. Above are some details you might find pertinent. I'm not expecting much. But Thank You

&gt; Georgia Tech has announced its intent to enter into contract negotiations to purchase Canvas by Instructure as the Institute’s new learning management system (LMS).
&gt; 
&gt; Selection of Canvas is the result of a campus-wide, explorative study to replace T-Square. Started in fall 2015, the selection process was driven by a Faculty Steering Committee and involved faculty, students, and staff. The next step in the process is to complete contract negotiations to secure the purchase of the software and services before we begin implementation and migration.
&gt; 
&gt; A small group of faculty will begin using Canvas in fall semester 2017 in preparation for a general campus release. Migration of course content is expected to begin in January 2018 (Spring Semester 2018) and continue through the beginning of Spring Semester 2019.

I read on NCAA.com that the average D1 soccer budget per year is $178,000 with the largest being $450,000.  GT, although it does not have the largest athletic budget, should still be able to finance this cost considering our athletic expenses are roughly 60 Million per year. We are paying Paul Hewitt more money per year to NOT coach our basketball team than it is to run and finance a soccer team. 

Secondly the vast amount of international students we have here who may not care about American football would take a more active interest in soccer and might show up to games. The market for soccer in Atlanta is big. Just look at all the sold out Atlanta United games. If Tech's soccer team could get even get a quarter of the fans who show up for ATL UTD we would be top 10 in attendance.

Thirdly the south (other than Clemson) has a defecit of D1 soccer teams. If Tech can create their program before some other teams in the South such as Bama, Auburn, u(sic)ga, we will get an edge in recruiting all the local young talent.

Finally, Tech would be part of the ACC, which is one of the best conferences for soccer. Clemson, Virginia, Wake forest, Lousiville, and North Carolina all have top caliber programs. 

I really hope in the coming years that Tech considers creating a D1 program for soccer and I as an alum would love to go out and watch some games. "

A job that could have been done with cardboard and a marker.


I'm completely convinced at this point, that most of the benefit of faset is directed towards the leaders themselves, and not the incoming freshmen. Over the summer, these leaders travel in a flock. They walk around our campus doing weird things, taking pictures of each other in the campus that they've lived in for years. They have such cultural, ethnic, and behavioral diversity to the point where you can speculate that individuals were ONLY picked for the illusion of inclusion. I guess these cult-like actions are kind of like how sororities act. Minus the diversity, of course.


They have all these coordinated songs, jingles, and dances that nobody really likes (except for some leaders of course). Incoming freshman are too awkward to say anything about it, they just go along with it. ""Haha. Yes my faset leader. That is.. cool.."" It's like that slightly uncomfortable feeling you get when you're hanging out with people who are very close and have many inside jokes you just don't get. Except in this case they're trying to impress you: ""Hi there kids listen to this chant we have, you like it, no?No?? We'll repeat it anyways. Stay there and watch."" The only people who say they enjoyed faset are leaders themselves.


There are few beneficial aspects I remember about faset, one being the ECE-specific presentation with faculty. Certainly nothing from faset leaders. They couldn't help anybody register for classes, without a doubt. Too busy choreographing acts that personified T-Square.


Slightly /s but also not really. Change my view..?

Edit: when I said ""...diversity"" I wasn't being sarcastic and saying they're all the same. I think it's one of the most diverse / unique sets of people.

please help me if I should stay with gatech. I am currently a CS student. Before changing my major to CS at the age of 24, I had no CS back ground. 

I enjoy coding, though till now I have not had any app written by my own. I am not fast-pace learner, but I am a logical person and can understand most of things if I work hard on it (my background is mechanical engineering).

But in gatech I always feel myself incompetent. I always feel I am the only one that does not understand a thing while everyone in class knows what they need to do. People around me seems to be able to finish a homework with little effort, while I always have to have either TAs or my friends help me with (trust me, I write my own code). Eventually it developed into anxiety and withdrawal, to the point that every test, quiz, or when doing homework I feel hard to breath and coming to me a great fear covering the whole body that makes me unable to think straight. 

I am not a traditional student but still manage to do full time (12 credits hours). I spend 3 hrs/day of commuting. I work 10 hrs/week. I live with my mom who is 40% disabled and I am the only child living with her. I just feel Gatech program is so vigorous that students like me hardly fit in. I have pressures of taking care my mom, of working and finding loans to feed myself, of staying in school from dawn to midnight to do group homework and worrying about leaving my mom at home alone (she got depression, too). 

The last semester is the worst semester in my education. I took cs1332, cs2110, math3012 at the same time because I am a transfer student and I ran out all buffering classes. I could not even sleep even after I finished and submitted the homework. I totally abandoned my mom. I managed to pull 2 B's on cs1332 and math3012 and an A's on cs2110, of course with the help of my friends and group study. 

Should I stay at Tech? I know it is one of the best school. But I feel like my mentality reached the breaking point. After that semester I was out of school for 1 year, take a $9/hr job and work 70 hrs/week and still feel happy. Now facing the possibility of going back Tech again just makes the nightmare come back to me again. I heard things get harder for CS now at Tech.

P/S: I find it is hard to group study at Tech. People at Tech tends to be very independent. In my group we are all transfer student from a same school, and we have the rule that if one member is slower than the rest, we will stay and help that person until he/she finish his/her homework. But at other classes Tech students they don't treat me like that. Once they find out that I a little bit behind, they just completely ignored me."

6s43ep,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/6s43ep/psa_dont_buy_a_meal_plan_if_youre_going_to_live/,PSA: Don't buy a meal plan if you're going to live on west.,115,53,2017-08-07 00:41:42,"Because 'da woods' is going to be closed for the upcoming semester, the only place to spend meal swipes on west campus will be the new West Village.

Each swipe at the West Village gets you $8 worth of food exactly - anything more than that comes out of pocket.

Let's do some math.

The best bang-for-your-buck meal plan is the Meal Pass 336, with 336 swipes for $2,420, plus $200 in dining dollars and $50 in buzz funds. This means you're paying $1,990 for those 336 swipes.

Assuming you use literally every swipe (spoiler: you won't), each meal comes out to around $5.92. The break-even point for this plan - that is, how many swipes you have to use in order to reach exactly $8 per meal - is 249 swipes. There are 115 days from the start of the term until the last final exam, so you're looking at an average of 2.16 swipes per day including weekends and Thanksgiving break.

TL;DR SO FAR: On the meal plan with the best value, you have to use at least 2 swipes per day every day in order to break even on a meal plan if they eat only at West Village and spend literally all $8 of their allocation.

If you're a freshman living in a Freshman Experience dorm, you're SOL because you are required to purchase a meal plan. Sorry.

Now let's do the same math, but with dining points.

If you buy $2,000 dining points instead of a meal plan, you will earn a 10% bonus on those points and receive a total of $2,200 to spend at any location on Tech campus that accepts dining points. This includes West Village, the dining halls, any restaurant in the student center, the food trucks, Starbucks in the CULC, the Biotech Quad and the College of Computing.

If you were to spend exactly $8 per meal for every meal, you would be able to purchase 275 meals at almost any food location on campus. This number gets even better if you don't spend $8 per meal, but that's not exactly a fair comparison.

**DISREGARDING ALL OF THAT NONSENSE ABOVE**

THIS is the most important point: if you buy a meal plan for the semester, every single swipe you do not use is wasted money. The swipes will expire and you will have essentially made a tax-free donation to GT Dining Services. If you don't spend exactly $8 every time you use a swipe in West Village, you will lose money.

*If you are living on west, West Village is the only nearby option to spend swipes.* Combine that with the above and you are essentially guaranteed to waste money if you buy a meal plan.

Just buy dining dollars. As a bonus, you can buy some groceries from Westside Market with them in a pinch. They've got basically the same stock as a convenience store."

In addition, all but one of the team members have already graduated, and this last member is on his final semester at GT.  I'm heavily interested in forming a Hyperloop team again that will actually build a pod this time and hopefully compete at the third Hyperloop competition (given that SpaceX holds one).

For those who have no idea what the heck a Hyperloop is, here's the rundown:  It's Elon Musk's concept of a high speed ""train"" that consists of a pod levitating inside a tube with very low air pressure.  This allows the pod to travel at speeds that are just under the speed of sound.  Ideally, the system would be cheaper than a high-speed MagLev train, specifically California's proposed high-speed rail.  Through engineering, this has been proven to be a possible reality, as the startup Hyperloop One has already developed a pod capable of reaching very high speeds on a test track.  

SpaceX has held multiple competitions between college teams that engineer and develop their own Hyperloop pods and race them on test tracks that SpaceX provides.  Georgia Tech lacks one of these teams, which is surprising considering the fact that we are one of the top engineering schools in the world.  It becomes even more surprising when you look at the fact that other top and non-top engineering schools have these teams, such as Michigan, Purdue, MIT, Auburn, Maryland, UC Berkeley, Wash U, USC, and many more.  We should have our own piece of this pie and make a name for ourselves in this new technological endeavor!

You are a disgrace to this school, this city, and this country. You are violent animals using a tragic death as an excuse to act like such. You're voices are not being heard, only your stupidity. 

Of course, everyone has a right to voice whatever opinion they may have, but do not turn our campus into a battleground for your senseless war on order.

What happened was a tragedy, and GTPD responded in the best way they could. It has since been revealed that the victim has called the police reporting that they had a gun with them as well. GTPD was incredibly tolerant, gave the person ample time to disarm themselves, comply with police, and end the situation calmly. This did not happen unfortunately, and instead they continued to walk towards an officer, knife in hand, and reportedly with a gun.

DEAR GTPD: These protest do not voice the opinion of your school. We respect you and appreciate everything you do for us each and every day. The other night, one of your officers was presented with a nearly unimaginable situation. We understand the events that occurred and the unfathomable decision that had to be made.

I angrily stomped back to my dorm ready to tell them to fuck off.  I thought about jumping into traffic on the way.  Or slitting my wrists as soon as they left.  And instead of being met with the accusations and cruelty I expected, I was met with three of the kindest men I have ever met.  They asked if I was okay. They asked if I didn't want to be alone.  And they asked what they could do.  I am here today because of this moment.  Knowing they were there, knowing that I could go to sleep with three strangers wanting me to be alive in the morning--this made all of the difference.  I have graduated.  I am so happy.

While Scout was a victim of their mental illness, they were not a victim of the events that led to their death. Scout committed suicide via cop, which meant creating a situation where the cop was forced to shoot. If the cop didn't take the shot then, Scout would have continued to approach and presumably stab the officer. Just visualize the world where that happened instead of the officer taking the shot that he did.



Given the way these events played out, why is it that Scout is the face of PSA's demands? That the new LGBTQIA+ club room is named in their honor? Scout may have been a victim of their mental illness, but the way they went out was not the way of a victim. It makes me uncomfortable that we're going to pretend that Scout was wholly innocent that night.



Suicide obviously isn't a light topic, but as a suicide survivor myself, this whole situation is incredibly uncomfortable. We're glorifying the actions of a student that forced another to take their life, destroying the lives of two people in the process. I'm not trying to say that the officer suffered equally to Scout, but Scout's actions were selfish. Scout unfairly turned another human being into a villain, drove their Antifa comrades to attack other officers just a couple nights later, and the saddest thing is that Scout took something away from every single person that their life may have touched. Scout caused so much pain to their own friends and family by unfairly taking their own life.



Suicide is not something to be glorified, it is a tragedy. Maybe it's easy for me to distance myself from Scout's death since I didn't know them. Maybe I don't understand the struggles of LGBTQIA+ people because I'm a straight white male. Maybe I don't understand mental illness because my own is worthless due to my privilege. Despite all of this, I implore the Georgia Tech community to take a hard look at who Scout was on that night and choose to not honor the person that almost stabbed a police officer and then posthumously incited a riot. Instead honor the Scout that was a community leader, a mentor, and a friend. Honor Scout's memory by not creating a divide between those who are part of the LGBTQIA+ community and those who aren't. Please work to build bridges between those who don't quite understand each other yet.

Georgia Tech has gained national attention as a result of this incident, and while today’s communications technologies provide us with almost instantaneous coverage, we must rely on professional investigation and evaluation, and not draw conclusions too quickly. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) is currently investigating the incident and reviewing all of the circumstances surrounding Scout’s death. Details will be revealed by the GBI as they become available.

For now, we are focusing on mourning the loss and remembering Scout’s many contributions to the Georgia Tech community over the past four years. Last night’s vigil at the Campanile that was coordinated by the Pride Alliance and the Progressive Student Alliance was attended by almost 500 community members including Scout’s family. Unfortunately, they were also joined by several dozen others intent on creating a disturbance and inciting violence. We believe many of them were not part of our Georgia Tech community, but rather outside agitators intent on disrupting the event. They certainly did not honor Scout’s memory nor represent our values by doing so.

Rest assured that our campus community is responding to these recent events in a positive and constructive manner, in spite of the many challenges they represent. I am grateful for our students, faculty, staff, campus leaders, and for our campus police. The response by our students to last night’s events is particularly heartwarming – they were on Facebook and Twitter through the night trying to find ways to show support and to say this is not who we are. 

In closing, I want to convey to you how proud I am of the Georgia Tech community. I know the true character of our community and am confident that we can work together to address our challenges and heal.

Let’s do it the Georgia Tech way. We are, after all, One Georgia Tech.

You’ve got inflammatory stories like the one in the NY Post trying to cast GTPD as a bunch of bigoted assassins, which anyone who’s interacted with them knows is untrue. Not to mention that depicting Scout Schultz as a martyr in such a high-profile incident will only encourage similar suicide attempts by others on campus (suicide clusters are a well-documented phenomena). I guarantee you that there are people in our community right now who are taking this all in and have been pushed a bit closer to the edge because of it. At least at the campus level let’s try and avoid diving into the rhetoric right off the bat."

If we're to claim we actually support students' mental health, we need a drastic expansion of the Counseling Center and the psychiatric services provided through the Health Center.

I dropped yesterday due to mental health issues. Recurring depression and grief; it became overwhelming early this month. The best intake appointment I could get was in mid-November, and apparently this is the standard for this time of year.

That's not a situation to be put up with. That's a fucking *problem.* That's a failure of the counseling center to do the job it was established to do.

Semesters are broken in a matter of days or weeks, not months. Nobody can pre-plan their mental health crises around a booking schedule, and the kind of help most of us need isn't something you can ask for from one talk with an on-call crisis advisor.

We need enough professionals available to build meaningful relationships with patients in need, and to do so within a time frame that *actually makes a difference* for those involved.

I argue that it's on the school to realize just how intense an environment its students live and work in compared to most institutions, and if it believes its own lip service to our mental health, to expand the professional support staff to meet our needs."

73u4wg,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/73u4wg/sign_up_for_duo_now_or_youll_be_screwed_later_and/,Sign up for Duo now or you'll be Screwed later (And not in the kind and loving way),74,49,2017-10-02 10:10:31,"TLDR: If you are an enrolled student on the GT Atlanta campus, you should sign up for Duo two-factor authentication sooner rather than later. Like, now. 

**If you don't, you will be locked out of things you need to pass your classes.**

This is just a friendly warning of the consequences of not signing up for Duo by October 16. Duo is not optional and based on the meeting I just left, the deadline will not be extended.

To be completely clear, I do not work for OIT and I have no influence over policy. I'm a system administrator in one of the departments but I am not speaking officially.

If you don't sign up with Duo, starting on October 16 you will not be able to log into a number of campus services. These services include campus printing, T-Square, Buzzport, and office365.gatech.edu. If you wonder whether or not the service you depend on is included, you should assume that it is.

Any student who is already signed up for Duo can enroll another student through Passport. Log into Passport and click on the ""Assist Another Person"" link and then on ""Set up Two-factor Authentication for a GT Account"".

If you are already signed up for Duo, you should go out of your way to help other students get signed up. Use it as an excuse to talk to that student you have been wanting to talk to.

Contrary to rumor, you do not have to receive a phone call to use Duo. Once you install the Duo Mobile application to your phone, you can use the ""Send A Push"" option when logging in:

iOS: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/duo-mobile/id422663827?mt=8

Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duosecurity.duomobile

You may think this is a hassle, you may think this is unnecessary, you may not want to do it. That really doesn't matter. This is happening and enrolling now will make it much, much easier. If you wait until the 16th when you can't log in to that website you need for class, you're going to be unhappy. You'll be waiting in a long line of people who didn't sign up. If you do it today, it will take about 10 minutes.

As one of the IT folks on campus, I'm glad we're doing this. It will make logins more secure and it reduces the consequences of a stolen login or password. I've been using it for more than a year. It doesn't make my job more difficult and I have to log in to more services every day than you do in a week.

I'll stick around to answer any questions I can. I won't argue questions about whether this is a good idea, why you have to do this or if an exception can be made for you. The answers to those questions are: ""It is"", ""Because it is"", and ""It can't"".

75phe2,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/75phe2/the_end_of_single_factor_signon_is_near/,THE END (of single factor sign-on) IS NEAR!,72,25,2017-10-11 07:39:59,"There are (and I'm not making this up, this is actual data) over **8,000**  students on the Atlanta campus who have not signed up for Duo Two-Factor Authentication. The deadline is next Monday, October 16. 

If you are on the Atlanta campus and you don't sign up by Monday, Monday will be  a Bad Day. So either find a friend who has signed up for Duo so they can enroll you through Passport or go to the TSC in Clough (it's behind Starbucks). Any student who has a job on campus is probably enrolled.

You can save yourself (and everyone else) some time by installing the Duo app first:

iOS: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/duo-mobile/id422663827?mt=8

Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duosecurity.duomobile

""But this is a hassle! I don't want to do this."" Noted. I'm just an IT guy speaking unofficially and I'm not going to argue. It's not my policy to defend. But if you don't sign up, you won't be able to do things like print to a campus printer, log in to T-Square, Buzzport or Techworks,  use the VPN or a bunch of other stuff.

""But"", you say, ""Surely with all these students having ignored the warnings, they'll extend the deadline!?"" I don't work for OIT and I don't make policy. I just know what I've been told: the deadline isn't being extended.

""But I need to turn in homework on Monday!"" Then you should probably sign up for Duo today. Today it should take about 10 minutes. Monday, who the hell knows? 

""This is very inconvenient and I don't have time for this right now. I've got fruit fly eyes to count!"" Well, OK. But Monday's going to suck.

""I'm a rebel. They can't make me and I won't do it."" You go! You stick it to the Man! Write something in chalk on Skiles Walkway! That'll show 'em.

""I don't wanna!"" But you gotta. And if you don't, you won't get dessert and you'll have to go to bed early.

I wouldn't even come here to rant about it, but tonight they just pissed me off.

I ordered some ravioli  around 7:00 after waiting in  for around 5 minutes; there were around 8 other people waiting for their food. So I figure it will be about a 15-20 minute wait no problem. So around 20 minutes they call two guys who had ravioli who I thought were in front of me so no big deal I'm probably 1 or 2 away. So after another 5 minutes a couple other people come up to order and one of them gets the ravioli. The employee immediately gives them the ravioli so I come up and ask if my name is on there because I ordered around 25 minutes ago. Now the part that pissed me off.

The guy doesn't seem to believe me and gives the other person the ravioli. They ask what I ordered and so I told them, and then a manager or someone says to go ahead and give me my food. But then they keep preparing some mac or something for the next person in line. He then prepares two raviolis but give them to the people who just ordered them. He then says he has to get more from the back and then takes another 10 minutes to cook it. He then gives it first to ANOTHER person that ordered it and finally gives me the ravioli. So after 45 minutes I finally get my food. 

tl;dr Olive lost my order again, didn't believe me when I said I ordered it, then gave 4 other people my order before finally giving me my food.

I am sorry to bring up my issues , but this week has maybe the most stressful of my life , even causing me to have suicidal thoughts. I talked the on call counseler , but while they talked really good , I still find myself dealing with it. Maybe it was because I been in a psychiatric ward before for attempted suicide. I feel like this semester has been especially hard for me , and I just feel depressed all the time or either I am having suicidal thoughts. I also feel like any efforts I make to better myself , just result in people being pissed at me. I just want to chill out , but it seems like its impossible except for very brief periods with my friends. Then it goes back to this when I am alone.I go to a therapist weekly and psychiatrist regulary and they try to help but I feel maybe I am just a broken person.

Apparently Sodexo, the contractor that runs GT dining, it dispersing generic penalties to their workers for taking sick leave. That's right. 



Technically it is illegal to dock employees for taking sick leave but they use the loophole of dishing out generic penalties. It is legal to dock an employee if they reach a certain number of penalties. 



This caused workers to not take there sick leave, and according to these dining workers, this is why there was an outbreak of norovirus. Yet another reason to be frustrated with GT dining.

I will forever remain disappointed by the way that this past weekend has been handled, or mishandled, in dining locations across campus, but specifically West Village. Students who should be studying for finals have been forced to endure hour-long lines, extremely limited food selection, and even [employees too ill to work](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/7iyl83/regarding_spice_trail_and_wv_in_general/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) while trying to simply get a meal to eat. This should not and cannot be tolerated from a company dedicated to facility management and dining services.


This weekend at West Village was plagued by a significant to complete lack of supplies. As I was informed by employees on multiple days, the shipments of food that were expected did not make it through, leading to four out of five 'micro-restaurants' being closed at the same time and lines for the final micro-restaurant exceeding one hour long. I find it absolutely incredible that a company as large as Sodexo was either unwilling or unable to find drivers or people with shovels in order to ensure that the sole dining location on West Campus remained supplied with food. While Atlanta was significantly slowed by the snowstorm, there is no reason that it would have been impossible to deliver food, even if it required paying employees overtime to stay later into the night to restock. By failing to make arrangements to supply a primary dining source for hundreds of students shows a horrific lack of management and preparation on the part of Sodexo.


May I remind you, Sodexo, of what you are to the GT Community. While you may view yourself as a simple caterer, the reality is that for many students, especially freshmen on your *mandatory* meal plans, **you are the sole source of food for many students living on campus**. It is completely unacceptable for you to be this unprepared for a weather event that only made travel times longer, and exceptionally disappointing that many students studying for finals may have gone hungry. I'm frustrated, irritated, and profoundly disappointed at the level of incompetency on a day-to-day basis at West Village, but I can see that Sodexo really went above and beyond to make sure that they failed utterly during a non-destructive weather event.

Please get it together.

Members of our campus community have been working together diligently this fall to address some of the challenges brought to light by events earlier this semester. Last month, three Action Teams, each comprised of students, faculty, and staff, submitted detailed reports on Student Mental Health, Campus Culture, and LGBTQIA Community Support. As I mentioned during our follow-up meeting with the three groups, we are incredibly pleased with their work, and appreciate the insight and time investment from all of the team members. Upon receiving the reports, I asked Institute leaders serving in various areas of responsibility to look at ways to implement the more than 180 recommendations, and to take it a step further by exploring additional actions that would address some of the challenges identified by the teams, while building upon the ongoing progress. I am writing today to provide an end-of-semester update on some of the initiatives that will help to ensure that we continue to improve our campus environment.

As anticipated, there were several areas of overlap identified by the three teams. To maximize effectiveness and take a holistic approach, we have begun the process of engaging leadership from numerous groups in discussions about the Action Team recommendations. A significant number of cross-campus/departmental discussions are necessary to identify the best ways to implement the needed changes. To assist in the process, we have created the Path Forward Advisory Group to provide counsel in responding to and prioritizing the recommendations. The following individuals have agreed to serve on the Advisory Group:

• Jennifer Abrams, Development Assistant, Office of Development, Georgia Tech alumna, and former Student Government Association president
• Abheer Bipin, Mechanical Engineering, fourth year
• Steven Girardot, Associate Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education, Georgia Tech alumnus
• Jenny Singleton, Professor and Assistant Vice Provost for Conflict Resolution and Advocacy
• Michael Vallecoccia, Program and Portfolio Manager, Strategic Consulting, Georgia Tech alumnus

Three of these individuals served as members of the initial Action Teams, and all are committed to helping ensure that these issues remain a priority. We anticipate that several of the Action Team members, as well as others in the Georgia Tech community, will interact with the Advisory Group members and continue to share ideas. The team will monitor progress, serve as a liaison with senior leadership, and partner to communicate updates with the campus community.

While our Action Teams were still hard at work this fall, a number of groups proactively implemented changes addressing several of the same issues identified by the teams. Some of these high-level actions include:

• Approval of up to $500,000 in matching funds by the administration to match the student government’s commitment of $500,000 in support of mental health initiatives
• Establishment of a $1 million endowment that will be used to support student health and well-being initiatives
• A $2.5 million endowment commitment from members of our Parents Board to create the Brandt-Fritz Dean of Students Chair (pending approval of the Board of Regents), with proceeds available to support student and mental health initiatives
• Suspension of the “16 visit” Counseling Center session limit 
• Implementation planning and funding for a Healthy Minds Survey in spring semester
• Modification of the “dean on call” process to make it more welcoming and accessible to students in crisis
• Exploring new technology systems for better coordination and collaboration between the Counseling Center and Health and Well-Being
• Funding for a new full-time coordinator position in the LGBTQIA Resource Center, along with discussion on expanded physical space for the Center
• Ensuring that all gender-neutral bathrooms are available for use whenever a building is open

While some of the Action Teams’ recommendations will require additional planning, coordination, and investment, many can be implemented through immediate changes by our campus community. Examples of some of these are listed below:

• We have received $4.5 million in new endowment commitments for mental health, as covered above.
• We will review staffing levels for caseworkers, clinicians, counselors, and psychiatrists to determine hiring needs, allocate required resources, and begin the hiring process. 
• The search for a permanent Counseling Center director has begun, and the search committee will identify finalists as early as possible in the spring semester.
• When advertising open positions in the Counseling Center, we will ensure that they are also advertised in places that might yield a therapist with expertise in the areas of gender therapy and working with transgender students.
• We are increasing screenings for depression, and a higher priority has been placed on training for peer interaction and intervention in mental health concerns.
• We will conduct an organizational review of the LGBTQIA Resource Center, benchmarking it with peer institutions to adopt and implement best practices.
• We will work with Capital Planning and Space Management to allocate space for an expanded LGBTQIA Resource Center in the Smithgall Student Services Building.
• We will conduct a comprehensive audit to determine where existing restrooms can be modified to increase the number of available gender-neutral facilities across campus. (We currently do this for all new construction.) 
• We will modify the existing LGBTQIA Advisory Board meeting schedule to include two meetings per year with the vice presidents for Student Life and Institute Diversity.
• We will conduct a thorough review and update of the Task Force on the Learning Environment recommendations and subsequent actions to determine what needs to be implemented or altered.
• We will determine what information exists that can be leveraged from existing surveys of Georgia Tech’s culture.
• We will explore options to expand the principles of the Georgia Tech Athletic Association’s Total Person Program campuswide.
• We will teach inclusive pedagogical practices to all new faculty at new faculty orientation, helping ensure that it is part of our culture.
• We will provide resources to amend the GT1000 and GT2000 curricula to focus on holistic development of our students.

As encouraging as this progress is, our work is far from done. We intend to continue discussing and building on the recommendations presented by the Action Teams through the coming spring semester in a variety of ways. First, the reports — and actions recommended in them — will be the focus of a Georgia Tech leadership retreat in January. Along with discussing the recommendations developed by the Action Teams, leaders will look for additional opportunities suggested in that work to make Georgia Tech the open, welcoming, and inclusive campus we all are committed to and envision, now and well into the 21st century. We plan to continue the conversation through a town hall in the spring, and listening sessions throughout 2018. 

Finally, throughout the spring semester we will periodically report to the campus on the progress and additional commitments and plans as they are developed. 

In many ways, this fall semester has been a time of challenge and growth for our campus community. I am continually encouraged by the conviction, commitment, and level of collaboration among our students, faculty, and staff to identify and address issues related to the continued health and well-being of our entire campus community. 

We have learned much by listening and working together to develop creative solutions, and this will make Georgia Tech a better place, now and for years to come. Thank you again for your engagement, your compassion, and your patience as we continue our path forward, together.

It's a big day for me to submit this application. I was never the shining example of a student in high school, probably average at best. I was lost in my life and didn't know what I REALLY wanted to do yet... but I knew from the beginning I wanted to be an engineer.

I looked at the schools available to me in Georgia, and of all of the engineering schools... the forbidden fruit was Georgia Tech. I couldn't afford it. I had HOPE scholarship, but that was it. My parents had just divorced right before high school graduation and they were living off the very last of their paychecks every month. It seemed like only a dream to consider going to GT.

I enlisted in the Navy. Six long, hard years on a submarine on two deployments. It wasn't the traditional way to pay for school, but I saw no other viable option for my situation. I worked day in and out, repairing generators, getting my hands dirty in the bilges, and troubleshooting. 

The day came when I saw my freedom and was honorably discharged. I didn't regret a single thing. I knew I could use my veteran benefits to pay for college. I also knew I did not have the high school grades to get into GT, so I applied to Kennesaw State (Formerly SPSU) in hopes of transferring in to Tech. This was my second chance. Nothing I did in high school mattered anymore. I didn't have to be that average student, I could be so much more.

I got accepted to KSU and eyed every prerequisite course I needed to take. I worked day in and out, taking advantage of the second chance I was given to prove to GT I could be somebody to them. I'm sitting at a 3.9 GPA after not being in any form of educational establishment for seven years. Last semester, finished the last prerequisites, and I can proudly say when I hit the ""submit"" button today, it was with most rewarding click of my life.

Whether I get in or not, it's not my decision. But I'm looking forward to the results and I really hope I'll be joining the rest of you engineering elites in the Fall.

Oh, and...

I just hate the way I look so much I want to die.  I’ve never had a girlfriend and I’m p sure that it’ll be impossible for me to do so at this school because of the ratio.  I just want to be physically and emotionally intimate with someone but I know I’m unloveable and that there’s zero reason for anyone to want to be with me in that way.  Besides even if I genuinely wanted to be with someone I think people would just treat me like some shallow pervert.

I also feel like I’m going nowhere and no matter what I do I’ll just graduate after 5 difficult, lonely years, then work some job I hate until I die.  People tell me to change my major or drop out but what would I do then??? How would those options let me do something more fulfilling???  Any way I slice it I’ll just be miserable or at the very least not be truly inspired.  But because my grades haven’t been so bad (still a freshman though) I don’t feel like I have much reason or purpose in leaving.

This is the fourth time I’ve been in crisis and the third time gtpd has intervened.  The other time I went to the counseling center and was sent to the mental hospital for over a week.  I started this semester confident and everything was fine for the first two weeks until this weekend when I suddenly had a relapse.  Talking to my parents doesn’t really help even though they try to, talking to my therapist does but I only see her 2x a week and can’t afford to go off campus more. I just don’t know what to do.  I tried to sign up for peer group but my dumb ass didn’t contact the guy until a couple of days ago (i wrote the email and forgot to send it).  I just don’t know what to do anymore...I wish I had a partner to comfort me or at least someone to tell me all the things I hate about myself are wrong, but that’s never happened before."

I started going to the Nave gym again this week, and it seems like the problem has been getting a lot worse. I feel like the whole 4 guest policy is justification for the dance teams to bring in people. 

I understand there's a reservation process, but around night it seems like dance people completely book the courts. I just don't see casual gym goers going through all the trouble to reserve a court to play pickup with a few friends. In fact, the gym now seems to deter residents from going. 

Even inside the gym equipment room, everyday dancers are still practicing their choreo and playing their music. I thought this wasn't allowed anymore?

The noise levels are really loud and bothers me even when I workout inside the gym room. 

I'm happy they opened up some north avenue conference rooms for the dance teams to practice in and I understand their problem with finding rooms to practice in, but I paid &gt;$1k a month for a gym to workout in and ball with friends. If they are to continue practicing here, I expect them to pay to rent out these rooms like other organizations have to do for events.

The bill, if passed, effectively changes the jurisdictional boundaries of campus police from 500 *yards* to 500 *feet* (from any Board of Regents owned Property). This means that all of GTPD’s extraterritorial patrols in Home Park, Centennial Apartments, and other student apartments on Spring Street and East of Campus would be no more. Atlanta Police is stretched thin as it is, and GTPD helps to fill in the gaps in some of these bordering neighborhoods where many students live. I urge you to contact your state representatives and urge them to vote “No” to this bill so that GTPD can continue to help keep us safe.

1) Even being in the middle of Midtown, Tech has its own little bubble. Its really hard to tell you're in Atlanta unless you look up at the skyline. Coming from the Atlanta Campus of GSU, where everything is mixed in with downtown ATL, this has been a great change.

2)How helpful everyone can be. Everyone from classmates, to instructors, to /u/GaTechPD (gotta give the shoutout) have been awesome.

3) There is so much to do its hard to get started. Looking at all the clubs and activities on campus its easy to be overwhelmed with ""where do I begin""

I've quickly realized several things about myself. What works at State, does not work at Tech. This is a whole new caliber of work and while studying was a full time job for me at State, I've gotta put in overtime these next two years. I'm looking forward to it.

This is especially a problem during the weekends, where some buses don't show up at all.

Last Sunday when it was raining the only trolley at the time suddenly lost connection. It was especially frustrating because it was raining outside and neither the display at the bus stop nor the app were showing the bus.

When I finally boarded the trolley, I asked the driver and he said that the ""tablet ran out of power"" which doesn't make sense because the tablet is always charging on the bus. The driver also drove a different route and skipped stops altogether, a whole different issue.

This is a huge oversight on GT PTS's part and contributes to the unreliability of the bus system. With all the crime reported lately, it is imperative that GT provides us a reliable and safe mode of transportation. 

A side note, as much as we hate U(sic)GA, their bus system is leagues better and more reliable than ours. UGA buses are always on time, update through their respective app, AC/heat is on, and operate transit buses. Why can't we do the same at Georgia Tech?"

I know depression is a big problem in the GT community, and that this type of post is very common in the subreddit. But, I think I need help right now, and I am currently contacting my counselor from last summer. I feel like I am losing my support network over this past few months.

It started in November of last year when my dad passed away from his health complications. Although I pulled through for the Finals, I am currently feeling more lost than ever. I miss him so much, and I feel like there is no purpose in life. Before my father passed away, my family had to sacrifice a lot of things and opportunities to help his disability and general muscle weakness, but I feel like there is a purpose in doing everything. Now, everything besides working myself to death seems worthless.

The only time that I am truly alive right now is going to work, where I can ignore these feelings. Working in a co-op is the only thing that is keeping me from going insane, and I know this is not healthy. I tried talking to my family about this mental episode that I am going through, but most of them are unable to understand my current feelings. Furthermore, my brother and stepmom are going back to China next month, and I am going to be alone in my struggles for the next few months. I feel like this is necessary, but I am also afraid of the consequences.

My days seems so meaningless outside of projects that I am working on with my co-workers and students. I hate going back to home, where I do nothing besides watching Twitch streams, YouTube videos and Reddit feeds. As a result, my social life could be described as abysmal right now. I don't know what to do; I feel like a broken record.

Since the beginning of last fall, many fraternities and sororities on campus have begun construction on new houses.  Understandably, Georgia Tech creates construction zones where street parking is blocked off for construction crews to park and deliver equipment and materials.  Georgia Tech parking office, however, has been allowing contractors and other crew members to park their personal vehicles outside of the allotted zones and in student parking spots when it appears to be in direct violation of their rules and regulations.  I contacted the parking office about the issue and their defense was that if anything it is an ""enforcement"" issue on the parking officers and besides that it should be okay for them park there because ""they paid more for the spot than you did"".  I have been reading all of Georgia Tech PTS's contracts, rules, and regulations and there is nothing that says that contractors/third parties are allowed to park outside of the allotted construction zones and there is nothing that states that Georgia Tech can sell student residential spots to no-students/faculty.  Also, PTS told me that should my lot be full (which it always is because of personal contractor vehicles) I would have to park in the nearest ungated overflow lot which is over a 5-10 minute walk from my parking zone.  I just don't understand why they make me do this and not make the contractors follow the same standard.  I am not sure where to go from here or if I can actually take any legal action, and would love some advice.  I have been talking to students who park in the same zone, and we have been talking about possible petitions, contacting Bud Peterson, and potentially even class action suit. Sorry this is a wall of text, but it is something I have been fighting for the last 6-8 months and am honestly fed up with. Thanks everyone, and feel free to let me know what you think or how you feel about the issue.

&gt;On Feb. 20, an officer was sent to Gate 6 of Bobby Dodd Stadium because dispatch had received a report of damage to the gate.

&gt;The officer spoke with the stadium manager, who advised that the damage to the slide up gate door was estimated to total $20,000. Video footage was captured of a golf cart hitting the gate three days before. The stadium manager stated that he could not find a golf cart at the stadium that had been damaged from the gate.

&gt;The following day, an officer contacted the stadium manager with some news. Upon detailed review of the video footage, the officer saw that it was two Sodexo Catering employees that had done the damage.

&gt;The passenger of the golf cart got out in order to open the roll-up gate, operated by a button. The driver began to approach the gate, but something fell near his feet. The driver bent to retrieve the item, the golf cart accelerated and the cart and driver crashed into the gate.

&gt;The roll-up gate seemed to still be functional, but ceased functioning the following day.

&gt;The general manager of Sodexo was contacted, and he provided the names of the individuals involved in the accident.

&gt;Several days later, the stadium manager was contacted and informed that Sodexo would foot the bill for the damage. The manager indicated that he did not want to prosecute the driver of the destructive vehicle.

She drives by people waiting by bus stops without stopping and doesn't wait the 10 mins she's suppose to at North ave. She's always complaining about some random crap and always holds up traffic to talk to other drivers. Most of the drivers are very outgoing and friendly and some I'm happy to see cause of how friendly they are. This driver though is just mean and disrespectful. Earlier today, after I had told her that she passed by people waiting for her, she started yelling at me that she doesn't need to be told how to do her job and then at my stop she didn't open the back doors and was rushing people at the stop to come onto the bus so I would miss my stop. After asking her to open the back she said "" you didn't tell me you needed to get off"".  I did report her and waiting for a call back. Anyone else on this reddit who's had trouble with the drivers?"
82ctnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/82ctnr/reasons_why_west_village_is_not_a_dining_hall_but/,"Reasons Why West Village is not a Dining Hall, but a Dining Hell",127,28,2018-03-05 21:54:44,"1. **The second floor is extremely crowded**, in terms of people, workers, garbage, and even restaurants. The various smells from the different “micro-restaurants”, along with the various stenches of the constantly filled garbage cans, all combine in the air to create the equivalence of mustard gas, suffocating the unadjusted on entrance, and slowly killing those waiting in line for their meals.
2. **Excessive wait times**. I remember just after west village had opened, I could head to Olive and order and receive my food in less than 5 minutes. I mean, you think it would be easy for a cashier to swipe a card, and a chef to scoop pasta into a bowl! Now, even during non-busy hours, you will be lucky to wait less than 20 minutes in line to order, and odds are you’ll spend 30 or more minutes waiting awkwardly standing against the railing, constantly moving out of the path of swarms of people. Sometimes they just forget your order too, so that can be an extra 25 minutes right there.
3. **The working undead**. Honestly the only workers who have a had a positive impact on me are the lady who takes orders at olive and the one chef at local chef. Every other employee seems to be on the verge of taking their own life, and will treat you as anything from a minor inconvenience to a thorn in their side. On top of this, I’m not sure if they just hate restocking or orders are coming from higher up, but they seem to be growing progressively stingier with the amount of food they give you. I used to get a loaded waffle at local chef, now I need to use my microscope to see the toppings.
4. **“Meal Swipes” replace all you can eat on entrance**. For people who used to eat 10$ exactly this is great. For people who eat less than 10$, They’re wasting money on food they won’t eat. For people who are still hungry afterward, they have to use an additional meal swipe/ 10$ for more food. WV is stealing food from the hungry and giving it to the full.
5. **More workers than students**. I am not saying that the workers should not eat, but when I am in line for lunch, and out of the 6 people ahead of me 4 of them work there, I can’t help but feel I’m going to get shafted by the cooks favoring fellow employees over students. On top of this, it is blatantly obvious that sometimes the workers just take an impromptu break from preparing food, preferring conversations in back. We can see and hear you back there, and you’re only making the backup longer!
6. **The soda dispensers are like slot machines**. Will they have all the flavors? Or none of the flavors? Will it be the legendary case where there’s a little left, so you cycle through five different flavors just trying to fill your cup? All are possible, unless you go during normal hours, in which case all the flavors will be out, no matter which floor, or which machine.
7. **Lack of dining for a dining hall**. Odds are the food you want will be out at some point. Sometimes, it will run out and not be available for the rest of the week. They can be out of entrees, sides, drinks, you name it. Sometimes the question isn’t what they don’t have, it’s what they have left.
8. **“Bathrooms”.** Odds are, 4 times out of 5, the restrooms will be closed for maintenance, cleaning, or just inexplicably locked. On top of this, considering the amount of people usually at WV, they are pathetically small. Not to worry though, you’ll never even want to use them, because they will be out of hand soap, paper towels, and or tp. Although, you might just be seeing through the tp, which is MICRO-ply.


I could tell you to boycott them, but odds are you’ve already stopped eating there because of how shitty it is. Truth is, they will always have a monopoly on required freshman, and we’ll all be shafted forever.

If you're trying to eat hashbrowns and chili at waho, then boy do I have some good news for you.

I found some inconsistencies in the pricing so that you can get the same thing for cheap 🤑🤑🤑

If you order them normally, then you pay $2.00 for the hashbrowns and $3.40 for the chili. Total of $5.40

Now the trick is, ordering the chili as a topping to the hashbrown which brings the price down from $3.40 to $0.50 for the first topping and $0.40 for every subsequent topping. But tell them to put the chili on the side and not on the hashbrowns itself. 

So your order is now $2.90 (assuming you got a double chili topping to make sure it's as much as the normal bowl of chili). 

You're welcome.

They have been aware of the issue for awhile now, but have been quite frankly apathetic towards the issue and addressing it (the responses to my emails have been very brief). At least two routes (Midnight Rambler and Tech Square Express) have not been showing any buses for awhile now and the other routes do not show buses frequently. Many people believe that GT PTS is the worst department on campus and I recently put out a survey to quantify just how bad people view Georgia Tech's busing services (I put these on all 4 class page Facebook pages just asking people neutrally what they think about the busing services on campus). I have made this in a hope that GT PTS sees just how bad people view them and makes a real effort to improve. Over the past few years many departments that have had issues have made great strides to improve, but GT PTS is not one of them.

The googley eye bandit has been struggling lately. The other night, the googley eye bandit's crew and them tried to make the biannual Great Googley Moogley happen again on Georgia Tech's campus, but alas the fruits of our labor were cleaned up before anyone could reap the joyous satisfaction of seeing a giant pair of googley eyes on the campanile.

All is not lost, but the googley eye bandit needs your help.

On Monday, April 23rd at 11:00pm, the crew requests you all decorate the lovely campus with googley eyes. Some popular pairs the googley crew uses can be found at these links:

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075L8LDPD/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1

A few things before you go wild:

1. Have fun.

2. THIS IS IN GOOD FUN. Be respectful of property by placing googley eyes in areas that won't damage property upon removal.

3. You'd be especially helping the googley eye bandit if you place the 7 inch diameter googley eyes on the campanile. If you notice there isn't a pair on it, please put a pair on to make the campanile be as stylish as it deserves to be.

4. 7 inch diameter googley eyes are not reserved for just the campanile.

5. The fruits of your labor may be washed away. Always carry a few pairs of eyes on you to replenish the scenery.

6. This is only meant to last through part of finals week to cheer up the student body. Once Wednesday, April 2nd passes, do not put up any more eyes. We must go back to dormant activity."

Not just one but multiple tech trolleys. Busses 103,104,and 105 have mold growing on the ceilings. If you look inside the lightbulbs on the ceiling, there is mold growing in all of the bulbs in all of the busses. Anyone who rides the trolleys are breathing in mold spores. This can cause health problems. I have contacted PTS multiple times by phone call and even submitted a written complaint and talked to the manager but there is still mold growing on all the tech trolleys and no one is doing anything about it. I also tried cotacting the president by submitting an online form but he hasn't responded yet. If everyone who reads this complains about mold growth and unhygenic conditions in tech trolley, we can get this problem resolved sooner. No one is fixing it and listening to me.

In high-school, I placed my entire identity in being good at school. I wasn't really good at much else, and I didn't really excel in non-academic areas. The only thing I thought I could do right was school. But, like a lot of other people, there was no way I could keep that up at Tech. Any time I did poorly on a test (which in my mind was anything less than a 90), I would spiral. I would feel worthless. I hated myself. I would practically question my entire identity, after all school was supposed to be ""my thing"". I just want any one reading this to know you're not alone. In fact, almost every Tech student I've talked to has a similar story.

 After about sixth months of counseling, I've gotten a lot better (still not healthy by any means), and if there is anything I wish I could have done differently, it would be talking to someone sooner. I thought I could figure Tech out, and that I could get better on my own, when really I was just digging a deeper and deeper hole. Don't wait until you literally want to die to talk to someone (like I did). Talk to someone you trust, preferably a professional, but even talking to a friend about how you're ACTUALLY doing is incredibly helpful. 

If you feel this way, you're not alone, and if you're thinking about getting help, you certainly would not be the first. You are a human being, you do not exist for the sole purpose of being a student.

I'm supposed to be majoring in physics with maybe a side of engineering at GaTech in the fall. I know Tech is somewhat well-known in Southern US, but I'm international and over here, Tech is a no-name. Now, I know prestige and whatever are not the most important things and that the quality of education at Tech is stellar, but a lot of my friends are going to schools that are better known (but of a much, MUCH, lower quality) than Tech over here. I'm happy for them (if I wasn't, I wouldn't have helped them for their apps), but I'm sure we all know that feeling where people ask your friend about their school, and go ""wow"" and then when you follow up, they just go ""oh"". Plus about half my family are obnoxious braggarts who think that they are the best thing since sliced bread because they or their kids studied in Europe. Certainly not in places better than Tech, but we have a history with Europe, and none with US, so European ones are better known here. I'd like to shut them up, just a little. I can't be the only one who's felt like this, especially when I can actually do it because Tech is great. I know it's petty, but come on, who hasn't been in my situation and felt like that?

Anyway, I'm looking for stuff that I can brag about a little for Georgia Tech. Nothing about its rankings or saying ""it's one of the best"" because that's gauche. Also nothing about athletics or diversity. Something impressive about alumni, faculty or the university itself. Bonus points if it's something in engineering, and bonus, bonus points if it's something in physics.

I'll start, so that I can make my contribution and hopefully give an idea of the kind of thing I'm looking for:

\- The former CEO, and one of the directors of the Coca-Cola company both come from Tech. The latter also was the CEO of American Express.

\- David Finkelstein, who was a professor emeritus at Tech, was essentially the first person to recognise that black holes prevent stuff from escaping it.

So, anything else to add to Tech's rep?"

It's daunting to start that conversation; it's scary to admit that maybe we can't do this on our own. Let it be known that there are people who want to help; I want to help. You're not weak for feeling sad, and you're no less than anyone for admitting your struggle. I'm here for you, and I want to implore all fellow techies to be here for you. Intellect is a valuable trait, but what does it mean if life feels empty and lonely. Reach out to your neighbors. Be here for one another, and trust that people want to help. Everyone has been in a low place in their life, and it'll happen again at some point. Someone has been where you are, or can relate. Take that first step. Reach out."

You know the saying, ""once is chance, twice is coincidence, third is a pattern""? Well this has now happened twice.  
One late night (like 2-3am) while with a friend, we were driving home on North Ave and noticed a truck driving with his lights off coming from the opposite direction. My friend flashed his headlights to let him know, and this truck swerved across the road towards our lane as if he was going to hit us head on. My friend blew his horn and the truck blew his back and then immediately popped a u-turn before Techwood on a red light and sped up to follow us. Luckily, a cop was at the intersection and pulled the truck over but the truck was accelerating hard after us and followed us all the way on to Tech Parkway when we tried to get away. That truck was not getting over for the cop either. We didn't stick around to find out what happened. This was probably a few months ago. 
Well tonight I was headed home alone from campus and was passing someone with their headlights off (again opposite direction). As it was hard to see the car in the dim light, I flashed them to let them know and I was not thinking. This car pulled another illegal u-turn right then on the bridge as soon as it got passed me and started getting into my lane. Not going to lie, I fled. Luckily I was super close to my apartment and pulled into the gated parking garage so fast. I don't know if maybe the car was already planning to u-turn but then why not wait for the intersection that was just over the bridge? But it was in the right-hand lane... 
I don't know if this was coincidence or not, but has anyone had this happen to them around campus? It's never happened to me before I moved to Atlanta. I do know I will never flash headlights again at anyone. "

I believe this will negatively effect students. The DVD collection is of medium/large size and contains a QUALITY collection of TV shows (like Game of Thrones), important classic and modern films, as well as new releases.

 The collection is very compact and does not take up very much space at all. It is nice to be able to browse movies in person, be spontaneous, look at cover art, and not have to wait until the next day to watch a movie you decide on. 

It is also nice because most of the collection are not going to be found on Netflix. Making their access difficult will likely lead students to pirate the movie online rather than wait for the copy from the library storage.

According to this Campus Services Organizational Chart in May 2017 (http://w1.campusservices.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/images/org_chart_0517.pdf), Mr Strouts was serving as VPCS while Mr. Lunsway is the Senior Director of PTS while Mr. Stipes is the Senior Director of Digital Networks with no one reporting to him.

I’m a Class of 2018 Georgia Institute of Technology graduate, with a Bachelors in Computer Engineering (CompE). I’m scheduled to begin my Masters in Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech in Fall 2018, through a 5-year accelerated BS/MS program offered by the School of ECE. I’m here writing about my experience with the computer engineering program, thoughts about the program in general, and what any incoming student should consider when pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering (or a related field).

### Key Notes

* Georgia Tech is organized into 6 major colleges. The two I’ll be focusing on are the College of Computing, which is home to the Computer Science major, and the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), which is under the College of Engineering. The school of ECE is responsible for the Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering majors.
* The CS, CompE, EE spectrum:
   * It is very easy to get the three majors confused and think that all three do the same thing, but understanding the difference is important for the rest of this article and for students in general.
   * Computer Science starts at one end of the spectrum. At Georgia Tech, the CS department offers various specializations that focus on computer science theory, media, modeling &amp; simulation, intelligence (machine learning/artificial intelligence), devices, systems &amp; architecture, infonetworks, etc.
   * Electrical Engineering sits at the other end of the spectrum. At Georgia Tech, the school of ECE offers specializations in DSP, Microelectronics, Optics, Power, Electromagnetics, etc.
   * Computer Engineering is at the middle of these two degrees. In theory, a computer engineer has the flexibility to study in areas that are closely related to CS or EE. CS specializations like devices, infonetworks, and systems &amp; architecture make up the core of CompE, but they can also include VLSI, DSP and the other EE core. This varies depending on what the computer engineer chooses to focus on. 
   * At the end of the day regardless of which of the three degrees you chose, you SHOULD have the opportunity to discover your interests and pursue what you like. You can be a CS major and find a passion for power electronics or you might be an EE and really enjoy media. **These three majors have their differences but are very closely related.**

I was admitted into Georgia Tech as an Electrical Engineer. My first year of coursework wasn’t bad - mostly general education classes that all freshman have to go through. I took my first ECE class my second semester. My third semester, I was enrolled in almost all of the 2000 level ECE courses: most notably, the 2000 level ECE Digital Signal Processing (DSP) course. This is widely accepted as the “weed-out” course in ECE. I had a very hard time with the course, enjoyed my programming courses more, and it was this semester that I switched to CompE. 

The ECE department advertises being able to count CS courses to the CompE degree, but fails to mention the exceptional difficulty for non-CS major students to get into CS courses. This makes sense because CS is offered by an entirely different College and they have their own demands for their own students.

To put this into perspective: One semester, I wanted to take a Computer Vision course being offered through CS. As a non-CS major student, I had to wait until Phase 2 in order to be eligible to register for the course. During Phase 1 registration, courses are restricted by major, year, etc, but during Phase 2 these restrictions are lifted. The computer vision course had 120 seats and a 200-person waitlist (all full) before phase 2 registration began, I was 75th on the waitlist. The moment that phase 2 registration began, the capacity of the course changed from 120 to 100. You might wonder why the CS department would do something like this? It’s simple, by reducing the number of students to 100, the CS department could control the waitlist. If a student decided to drop the course, the next student from the waitlist wouldn’t get in. 20 students would need to drop the class before the first person would get off the waitlist. For example, when a student dropped their seat in the course, if a non-CS major was #1 on the waitlist and a CS major was #2 on the waitlist, the CS department could move the CS student into the course while the non-CS student would still be stuck on the waitlist, essentially deprioritizing the non-CS major. 

It is very difficult for non-CS major students to enroll in CS courses. And as earlier noted the CS and CompE fields are very tightly coupled. But this is only half the problem, there is another aspect to the CompE program that is much harder to fathom. Areas of focus such as Systems &amp; Architecture have certain core concepts that fundamentally make the specialization and field. For instance, this includes operating systems, computer architecture, processor design, etc. The CompE program fails to provide these courses. For instance, CompE students at Georgia Tech do NOT have a course in operating systems. During one of my job interviews senior year, I was asked an operating systems question and responded with *“I actually don’t know how to answer this question, because I have no experience with operating systems.”,* to which, the interviewer responded “*How can you be so close to having a degree in computer engineering with no experience in operating systems? You haven’t taken a single class on this, not even an intro? What is your school offering?”* 

Some other shortcomings and aspects of the degree: 

* No course in processor design, with limited exposure to VHDL
* The primary embedded systems course has minimal programming, mostly wiring a breadboard and connecting some IO devices together. There is no focus on driver development, device driver optimizations, or relationship to embedded development in the industry. 
* The networking course is pure theory. I can tell you what the difference between a TCP and UDP packet, but beyond that there isn’t much I can say. For instance, if questioned how to implement TCP with the UDP protocol, I wouldn’t be able to do it easily. 
* No course in databases or database design

In essence, the CompE program doesn’t offer/require any coursework in certain foundational areas. Then, we can go into specific specializations to see how the program solely provides minimum fundamental knowledge and how students are deprived of necessary skills and experience. The irony is that the CS department does offer these courses and is better for these specializations, but frustratingly, they aren’t provided by the CompE major itself. When this problem is coupled with the issues that non-CS majors face, it significantly restricts the coursework CompE students can complete and puts into question the validity of the degree. 

And now that I just graduated with my Bachelors and soon will have my Masters, it’s embarrassing for me to tell my interviewers or managers that I don’t have knowledge of certain fundamentals because I just never took courses in them. More importantly, there’s so many things I wish I had the opportunity to learn. Of course, I can pick up these skills on my own and learn from online lectures, practice, etc (this is what I’ve been doing now), but what am I paying out-of-state tuition for? What is the purpose of graduating with a Computer Engineering degree? In the long run, all of this probably doesn’t matter because when you work in the industry you learn everything you need from the industry. However, my point is that, if I’m going to pay so much money for a college education, I want that education to be meaningful. 

As you’re reading this, you might ask me, why didn’t I just switch to CS? When I had switched to CompE, I had already spent 3 semesters of out-of-state tuition, and by the time I realized these problems I was a few semesters away from graduating. After spending so much money, I couldn’t afford to switch majors and spend extra time in school. This is something that I’ve uncovered through my time at Georgia Tech, and I think it’s very important for all incoming or current students to know this, so they can make the appropriate changes to better their careers.

The next major point to address is, if I’m interested in more advanced coursework, shouldn’t I get a masters? But how can you get a masters when you don’t even have some of the fundamental knowledge required to succeed in some of these areas? The problems that graduate CompEs face are reminiscent of the problems that undergraduate CompE students face, especially the Computer Systems &amp; Software discipline. This is the track that I will be doing during my Masters. 

So, if you’re considering a program in CS, CompE, or EE then take into account what you’re getting into and really dive into what your program offers. Look at schools like UIUC or Berkley where their programs are like EECS, where CompE students have immense flexibility and access to the courses they are interested in. When comparing the programs at UIUC and Georgia Tech, the Georgia Tech CompE program, in my opinion, is an absolute embarrassment, yet it’s only ranked 1 spot below UIUC (US News &amp; World Report). 

As I mentioned earlier, I’m now scheduled to begin my Master’s degree at Georgia Tech in August. I’ve been having trouble with the coursework I need to complete for the degree requirements. Essentially, the courses offered are not within the scope of my interests, I’m forced to take coursework in fields that I would not like to pursue, and this is coursework that I’m not ready for because I didn’t have the fundamental knowledge during my undergrad. I’m questioning whether or not it’s worth spending so much money on a degree that won’t mean anything to me and a degree, in my opinion, that shouldn’t even be called “Computer Engineering.” At the end of the day, I find myself asking whether I’m just simply shooting for a certificate with my name on it."

I am confident that like me, each of you feels a great deal of pride, loyalty, and devotion to Georgia Tech and its people. This is a special place, so it is difficult when we learn of actions or decisions that may not have been in the best interest of our campus community. As an institution of higher education supported by the state, it is imperative that we — both as individuals and collectively — act ethically, deal with issues openly and honestly, and never do anything to erode the public trust that we have been granted.

During the coming academic year, we must rededicate ourselves to promoting and ensuring a culture of ethics and mutual respect, demonstrating resilience in all we do. Our priorities and goals have not changed, and we will continue to work on those things that will enhance our educational, research, and economic development mission. As we do so, it is vital that we collectively and individually preserve public trust. Preserving public trust must continue to be our priority.

While changes in leadership can be unsettling, I ask each of you to remain steadfast in your commitment to Georgia Tech. As we identify interim and then permanent new leadership within the Division of Administration and Finance, we will continue to focus on their vital role of supporting the people, the infrastructure, and the learning environment here at Georgia Tech.

Your contributions are greatly appreciated and I owe it to you, as well as to the members of the public who support us, to ensure that Georgia Tech accepts nothing less than the best from each and every one of us. I urge you to continue the good work you are doing and I assure you that the Institute’s senior leadership team will work in concert with each of you to provide the very best possible leadership and work environment as we move forward together with integrity, openness, and purpose.

Thank you for all you do to make Georgia Tech the great place it is to work and learn.

While I was still attending Georgia Tech, back in January 2018, a student found me and saved my life. Not in a metaphorical or figurative manner. Literally saved my life. Through our short conversation, I learned that his name was Alec and he worked at a Starbucks, but I never got his contact information. He never got mine either. And worse yet, I never had the time to thank him. Hence, I want to get this weight off of me and properly thank him for being a truly wonderful human being. I'm sure this would help him too; given the circumstances, there's a good chance he's wondering how I'm doing after the incident. I don't have much but here's what I know/might know:

\-First name is Alec

\-Student at Georgia Tech when I met him

\-Worked at a Starbucks (possibly on campus)

\-I forget if he mentioned his major but if he did, it might've been Aerospace Engineering, or some form of Engineering (I know that doesn't really help narrow it down given the school, sorry)

\-About 6 feet, X inches tall (he was about half a head to a head taller than me, who is 5'10"")

I will add more information if by some miracle I remember anything else. Thank you sincerely for any and all input."

I want to make you aware that we have posted several reports online  detailing the results of special reviews conducted by the University  System Office and the Georgia Tech internal auditor. Following is a link  to the three reports: [https://c.gatech.edu/reports](https://c.gatech.edu/reports).  
 

Those in leadership must set a higher standard for ethical behavior  given their responsibilities for providing direction to employees and  preserving the public trust.  
 

We are making multiple changes to our organizational structure and  processes and are working hard to identify interim and then permanent  leadership who are committed to supporting a strong ethical culture.  Going forward, I am incorporating a new vice president for ethics,  compliance, and risk management who will report directly to me as  president. I already have changed the internal auditor reporting line  directly to me and to the USG auditor. We are engaging an outside  specialist to assess and identify ways we can strengthen our ethical  culture. We will continue to provide the campus with updates on our  progress.     
 

Georgia Tech is a special place, and we all have responsibility for its  hard-earned reputation as a first-class institution of higher learning.  Thank you for your continued service to and support of Georgia Tech.

I am looking for part-time caregivers to work for me. I work full time and am heavily involved in the Atlanta music scene. I'm pretty awesome and I'm looking for someone that can keep up. Duties include assisting me with activities of daily living (ADLs) like transferring, bathing, and dressing; driving me in my vehicle; and being generally awesome.

No prior experience is necessary. This is a great way to build a resume, especially for those wishing to work in the medical field. All caregivers are formally hired and provided training. Ideal for individuals who are or wish to become medical students, physical therapists, or nannies, or are just naturally attentive and need some extra money.

Requirements:

\- Must be able to lift 75 lbs

\- Must have valid driver's license, reliable transportation, and a good driving record

\- Must be willing to become CPR and First Aid certified

Start Date: All positions start around September 3rd, 2018

Location: Home Park (14th Street and Northside Drive)

Positions Available:

Position #1: Works Monday through Friday from 6:30AM to 9:30AM. This position involves helping me use the restroom, assisting me with bathing and dressing, and driving me to work in my vehicle. Pay starts at $10.00/hour and increases to $13.00/hour once trained. 

Position #2: Works Saturdays 11:30PM to 9:30AM for $72.50/night. This is an overnight position. It involves helping me use the restroom, transferring me into bed, and turning me when called (about 2-3 times per night). You will be provided a bed with memory foam topper and can nap as long as you wake easily!

Position #3: Works any time they are available for $13.00/hour. This is a backup caregiver position. It involves being put on a list of caregivers I can call in the event that my regular caregivers cannot work a shift. This position allows the backup caregiver to pick and choose which shifts they can work, rejecting shifts that they are unable to work, and involves performing tasks such as: helping me use the restroom, assisting me with bathing and dressing, and driving me to places in my vehicle.

Think you're awesome enough for this job? Let's be awesome together!

A little context, I am uber stressed. Not gonna list why bc everyone here is stressed. But just know that I am WAY more so than I normally am. It’ll add to the story I guess.

So I went to the store to grab some supplies for the weekend.. you know the usual Friday stuffs. Anyway the guy who drove me was in a rush so he dropped me off at the North Avenue Curb and left me with the maximum amount of plastic bags and one heavy “cardboard box” a well condition man could possibly carry back in one trip. I’m like, “okay this will hurt but I think I make it back to East by myself.” (All other friends are gone or in class).

I loop bags around my forearms and carry the box in my free hands. Around the Volleyball court, Publix Shitty Plastic Bags TM (c) rip and my and shit goes everywhere.

This is the worst part.

While I’m already on the ground feeing like an idiot picking stuff up and reconsolidating bags...  I hear someone say, “Hey do you need any help?” I look up and blankly stare at this super cute girl. I was like....  “Uhhhh... nooo that’s okay.”

She was like, “are you sure!? It’s really no problem.” Guys idk what to say, I froze.. very out of character. I was like “uhhhhhhh it’s okay I live all the way in East thanks tho.” (Presuming she was walking towards south)

She again was smiling and like “are you really sure!?” Like an idiot I was like “yeah thank you tho.” Guys I was already stressed and VERY rushed I just immediately regretted saying no to her help. I wanted to chase her down and apologize and thank her again but she was too far and I had too much stuff.

Now I’m also stressed about this haha. 

In my mind, best case scenario, one of your friends is a cute brunette girl (maybe 5’ 7”ish) that (maybe) lives in North Ave South and told you about trying to help some loser out and he refused and you’ll tell her to message me for a proper thank you!

Worst case scenario, I become a meme.
Actually that’d probably be second best case.

I guess average case nothing happens ):

If you have to, don't use them more than a few times a month. You are MUCH better off financially just buying a bike/ ebike/ skateboard/ electric longboard, proof below.**

As Atlanta seems to be the most recent victim of the electric scooter craze, I've noticed more and more people using them around campus. No doubt these are incredibly useful machines for **tons** of use-cases, but hearing (and seeing) kids ride these to class every day got me thinking if they were financially viable to use as your daily transportation.

# So in true Georgia Tech fashion... I did the math.

For reference: **Bird costs $1/ ride + $.15/mile**

First, let's start off with a conservative cost estimate; based upon the fact you use it **twice a day, 5 days a week for 3 mins/ride**. This would be representative of living on West campus, *quickly* taking it to the CULC in the morning, then taking it back to your dorm in the evening.

This usage ends up totaling **$2.90 per day, $58 per month, and $522 over the course of two semesters.**

$522 can get you a nice used bike, nearly two longboards, or a used/ cheap electric bike or skateboard. All for the same cost of using Bird for just a year.

  
Now for a little more realistic estimate based off of using it as you would, say, your own bike or skateboard; **4 times a day, 3 mins/ride (Average), 6 days a week.** Even this isn't all that much, for example; From your dorm into campus, back to your dorm after classes, then maybe out to dinner and back.

This ends up totaling **$5.80 per day, $150.8 per month, and a whopping $1252.8 per academic (2 sem) year.**

$1250 is a new, very nice bike or electric longboard or even a new electric bike. All of which you can go faster on than a scooter.

Needless to say, please, for the love of all that is good, *do not use these things to get to class everyday*. They are horrible uses of your money. I was surprised to see how expensive it really is to use them in that fashion. A few times a month because you're running late or want to go get food somewhere? Then they're absolutely perfect! Using them every day? Just don't."

Many students have voiced their frustration online in places where the campus administration never looks. I believe it is time to take our anger and use it a driving force for real change. We need to mobilize, and mobilize quickly, we cannot let Tech take our hard earned money and feed us slop in return. We have to act NOW!

​

The best way to voice our frustrations is to have a GT Dining opposition rally. Rallies and visible dissent are vital to producing real change, they allow us to come together and stand up with each other in solidarity against the tyrant that is GT Dining. We've all seen pictures of food in West Village that is so bad it wouldn't pass a Chipotle health inspection.

​

This is why I'm proposing a rally to show opposition against the current dining situation (if people think a Facebook event would be helpful then someone can also make that). We should get as many people as we can to go to Tech Green at 11:55am on Wednesday August 29th. Five minutes later at noon we should all T pose for exactly three minutes to assert dominance over GT Dining. Later that day we should storm all three dining halls at 6pm and T pose inside for three minutes as well. This is the only way we can fight against the system, I'll see you guys on Wednesday."

A lot of Tech students filter in and out of the community quickly enough that these pressing issues, although they are widely and deeply felt, often don’t have time to be addressed.  
We've reached out to HPCIA, the existing neighborhood association, but they're mostly homeowner focused. We anticipate collaborating with them, but we hope to bring the tenants in the neighborhood together so we can focus on tenants' issues: improving our roads &amp; sidewalks, getting repairs to our homes, and fighting rent hikes &amp; exploitative practices. After a few weeks of knocking doors &amp; talking to tenants around the neighborhood, we're ready to put the call out for our first meeting to make our organization official, establish leadership &amp; priorities, and get tenants under the same landlord talking to each other about common issues. And, of course, enjoy some delicious food. Hope to see y'all there!

The potluck will be held from 6 to 8 PM on September 3rd at 1063 Hemphill Avenue NW. All tenants &amp; home park residents are welcome!

What I mean is being able to walk up to a stranger doing their own thing and start a conversation, even if for just a couple minutes. Introducing myself to someone in class is doable but that's not an example of what I'm talking about. Something more along the lines of asking to sit with someone eating lunch or someone I'm next to waiting in line.

I feel confident in my ability to actually carry out a non awkward conversation granted that I am in one. I also realize that there are hundreds of opportunities on any given day to do this on a college campus, which is another reason I feel like I need to do this now. What scares me is that initial moment of talking to someone even though I have no good reason to. And even if it's irrational, as a guy there's always this subconscious fear that if I say hi to the wrong person at the wrong time I'll come off as a creep.

I'm making this post to ask if anyone has tried to do this before and succeeded (or failed), and has any input about where to start. Any advice would be appreciated. It's extremely frustrating to me that I feel isolated while surrounded by literally thousands of peers every day. :/"

94uqod,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/94uqod/what_bike_should_you_buy_information_and_resources/,What bike should you buy? Information and Resources,66,17,2018-08-05 13:05:53,"Hi all, volunteer here from the GT student bicycle cooperative, [Starter Bikes](https://orgsync.com/136167/chapter). We get a ton of people asking about what bike to get at the beginning of the year. Here's a brief list of recommendations (by no means exhaustive)

**0-100$**: Bicycle cooperative (starter bikes or SOPO) ie. we sell old abandoned/donated bikes and help you fix them up. 
**100-350$**: Craigslist for used bikes in good condition
**350-450$**: Giant Escape 3 ($360), Momentum Street ($410), Raleigh Cadent ($350) (easy to find discount codes for raleigh, just google)

**Above 450, A LOT of options start showing up (visit and support your local bike shop and ask about/demo options or feel free to PM me if you want to chat)**
**450-800$** these are just a few: Trek 7.2FX ($450-500), Marin Fairfax SC1 (top pick), Raleigh Redux 2, Fuji Absolute 1.9, Jamis Coda Sport, Raleigh Carlton, ([Check this article for a comparison](https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-hybrid-commuter-bike/)) 

Note: careful with buying something that looks flashy though, you don't want to be a target for theft. Otherwise you need to keep your bike indoors at night. 

I would recommend buying a new bike if you can since it'll be ready to ride and all the parts will be new and won't have to be replaced for a while (*DO maintain your bike though*). 

If you can't buy a new bike that's on the list **DO NOT BUY A WALMART BIKE** (unless you plan to use the bike for only 1 semester, explained below). Just come to the starter bikes cage to see our walmart bike graveyard. Those things are made of crap components that are difficult/impossible to replace or service. You're much much much better off buying an old bike that is of a decent quality (that will have serviceable components) AND you're up-cycling and not creating additional waste!

Of course if you are sort of mechanically inclined and want to learn how to work on bikes buying a craigslist bike at any price point would be a good deal as long as the bike is in good condition. 

**Why not a Walmart bike?**
You are buying this bike for it to be a viable means of transit so put in the time/money to get something that 1. functions and 2. is durable. The main point of this is to buy a bike that is **transport** and not a **toy**. **Toys** (walmart/target bikes in general) are non-servicable/repairable, break easily and ride like crap. Walmart bikes are built to be toys. *I'm not rejecting/denouncing people who ride walmart bikes, if one lacks better alternatives, any bicycle is better than nothing. I'm trying to help you get the best bike as possible within your means.*

Many quality made older bikes (usually rigid mountain bikes from the 90s) still function after 30 years, so they certainly will in most cases function for longer than a brand new walmart bike will. If not, the parts are plentiful, cheap, and easily replaceable. I personally ride a mountain bike made in 1990 (Bridgestone MB-3) and its awesome. Additionally crappy bikes that you just throw away with brief use is needless waste. DM me if you want info about these kind of bikes, they are usually found on craigslist for cheap. 

**Other things to be aware of:**

**Suspension:** You do not need suspension (unless you are mountain biking in which case you need to pay like 800$+ for something that won't break on the first bump). Will add that bigger tires = more suspension [(for those atlanta potholes).] (https://janheine.wordpress.com/2018/01/03/12-myths-in-cycling-1-wider-tires-are-slower/) Excessive suspension just makes you more inefficient on your bike and makes your bike heavier.

**Disc Brakes:** they are nice, they're even nicer in the rain but they aren't necessary unless you are planning to put a lot of mass on the bike (more than an average rider) AND riding in the rain. But please do not buy a bike with cheap crappy disk brakes (they all look like [this](https://i.imgur.com/vXijbG5.jpg)), they are actually worse than a similarly priced rim brake. You can also upgrade your rim brake pads to make them stop better.

[Saddles:](http://www.sheldonbrown.com/saddles.html) stay away from squishy saddles, contrary to expectation, they increase friction and chafing which causes discomfort. Harder saddles are generally more comfortable. Saddles are also replaceable and relatively inexpensive.

By the way, starter bikes is in dire need of volunteers - so if you want to learn how to fix and maintain bikes, up-cycle bikes, and help people get on bikes just show up and ask how you can help! We are open 4-6pm every friday at the bottom of the CRC parking deck. I'm super psyched to see you all on bikes this coming fall."

Hello,

As some of you may be aware, the Georgia Tech Student Center is set to undergo renovations and a redesign. These changes will begin around summer 2020, and at that point Under the Couch would close for the construction.

It would not reopen.

There are currently only plans to give Musician's Network practice rooms. There is no equivalent lounge or venue to Under the Couch in what the administration is calling the Campus Center.

This, however, does not have to be the case.

With enough student, alumni, and widespread support for Musician's Network and Under the Couch along with greater awareness of the importance of Under the Couch to Georgia Tech's music, art, queer, and general communities (as well the greater Atlanta music scene) there is a path to maintain the legacy of Under the Couch in the new student center.

Design modifications are still ongoing, and now is our time to show how significant the inclusion of Under the Couch is to student life at Georgia Tech.

There is no confusion here—Under the Couch must stay.

Thank you,

—Heath Murphy 
Musician's Network President

If you want it to be an exclusive group with just 20 of your friends than quit advertising publicly! It’s not like it’s God’s gift to me to get to do work for free but I do think it’s nice to be involved in something that benefits the community. Apparently I’m too unqualified to do work for free though despite the fact that I’ve actually been paid to do similar work. Sorry for the rant but I just find this type of thing very frustrating."

I wanted to study abroad this summer, so being a CS major I applied for and paid the deposit for the Barcelona summer program.

I also really like Simpkins, who is teaching an ML class that I really want to take in Berlin, but I was planning on interning next summer so I'd have to not do that to do this program.

I never brought it up with anyone because  it sounds like a “biased statement”; I know the material but...  I often  explain concepts  to fellow classmates  before exams but somehow it always happened that when exam grades come back I get much lower grades compared to them. So today one of the people that studies with me saw my grades for one of the classes  we are currently  taking together and, I guess, he was shocked. He couldn’t believe my grades are much lower than his yet, I’ve always been clarifying concepts explaining  problem solutions to him etc. This was the moment that made me  realize this is  not just my false impression but actually I do have a good understanding of material just my grades don’t reflect that. When I get my exams returned I often look back and wonder what the heck was I thinking. It appears that during the exams I have a totally different perspective and approach to problem solving. Part of me wants  me to systematically tackle the problem as I usually do  while the other wants me to rush and make progress faster and faster, this is where the mistakes are made or mental blockage occurs. I have already l made an appointment with a doctor next week to see if there’s anything I can get for my anxiety before finals but wanted to know if anyone here is experiencing something similar and what they did about it."

Some of us more than others. So, we seek out the counseling center, which by many reports is just fundamentally unable to handle this, and by similar reports we are then referred by the counseling center to a place called the Ridgeview Institute of Mental Health. Sometimes there is pressure to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought I'd share a few select reviews on yelp.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I would not recommend this facility. Apparently they sold about a  ago to a corporation and are no longer non-profit. They are definitely ""for profit!!""My son went in on a 72 hr. Hold and was held an extra 3 days for no reason that could be explained. I feel that the reason was that he had great insurance coverage. The therapist assigned to him even told us to be careful. That he would be pressured to attend a 6 week very expensive onsite program, that in his opinion my son didn't need. He said they were trained to pressure patients into this for the money.My son was set to be discharged after a family meeting and a long term plan was made (both were completed). On the discharge date, his paper work was ""lost"" and we were given the run around. We threaten to call the police and they sent security after us. The staff was so unprofessional and nasty. We were just asking to talk to someone in person and to have them explain to us why he was being held. No one ever came! We finally were able to receive a discharge date after 48 hours of continuous calls and visits.Be very careful. There are other options out there. This does not seem to be a good one more.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As a family member of an alumni I must say that this place is mediocre at best. Not only is immediate family completely left out of patient treatment but the communication about care and cost by the Ridgeview staff is pathetic and borders on corrupt. They were deliberately misleading about costs and I believe intentionally lowball the cost to keep patients committed longer and keep beds full. There was  no paperwork, no statements, limited disclosure about patient condition and were a series of last minute demands for money to be paid immediately. In our case I did not even receive a single phone call about our admission for 4 full days and had to search out a case worker who claimed to be overburdened.. In fact at discharge we were given a few hours to pick up the family member or incur full uninsured costs for 4 days that amounted to over a thousand dollars. . This is only good for an absolute last resort for a loved one. I would avoid at all costs!

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Do not let anyone force you to go here against your will. Refuse. Its a setup. Especially if you are not addicted to anything. I promise you. You will be a mess coming out of this for profit mental health facility. Do you know how they know when you are ""better""? When the insurance money runs out. No insurance? Haha. You aren't going.  Do you know that after you are admitted, legally you are considered someone who has a mental illness and a doctor can testify to that against you in court? Do you know that depression and anxiety can be considered ""mental illnesses""? Don't do it. If its your choice, fine, but know what you are getting yourself into.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This place was a nightmare. They just want your money. The psychiatrist I saw actually told me that he saw no reason why I should not leave, but when I told the staff, they said the psychiatrist (their doctor that THEY assigned to me didn't know what he was talking about and that he was wrong). I was there to get off benzos that multiple doctors had prescribed for me (severe PTSD) and had tried to come off myself and had seizures. I went there to come off them under supervision, thinking that was a smart move--HUGE MISTAKE!!  A certain racist nurse lied in my medical records about me and my ""drug seeking"" behavior because I asked for some ibuprofen (severe cramps) and that I was belligerent on my daily assessments, which was a bold-faced lie (no one else had problems with me), and other outright lies--this will remain in my permanent medical records until the day of die, classifying me as a drug addict, which I am not, to any future doctor or profession I enter. I am very familiar with the medical field and this place is all about dollar signs and mind control. Very sad.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I took my son for a mental health assessment at the suggestion of my insurance company. We waited for more than six hours to be seen. Once he was finally assessed, they recommended he stay for 3-10 days for stabilization of his mental health and addiction treatment. When he tried to leave and return the following morning with his essentials, they threatened to 1013 him, in other words, they were going to commit him. They had him in a prolonged and unmedicated panic attack where he was gasping for breath at times until basically, they forced him to check in or they would force him to stay. It was extraordinarily high pressured and felt almost like a forced sale. I was furious and my concerns weren't even addressed at all. Needless to say, they didn't treat him for his mental health stability except for increasing his meds. Very little treatment for his mental illness was received during his stay. Almost 100% of his time there was focused on his addiction. I tried to address my concerns post discharge with the patient advocate and was told ""his care was adequate per their records"". My son was suicidal the very night he was released and they had taught him zero coping skills or otherwise. My son came out of there with more of a day camp experience than treatment for a dual diagnosis, which is the only reason I took him to Ridgeview because they identify as a dual diagnosis facility. I will never take a soul there to be treated. Ever! Please consider your loved ones well being prior to ever entering the door. My sons condition and recovery were not improved remotely from his stay at Ridgeview. Very disappointed and frustrated that I ever subjected him to this facility.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Okay, so about 8 years ago I landed myself in this little plot of insanity. I get depressed, drink too much, and at the time I was admitted, I was suicidal. I ended up staying over 100 days. I think this was partly due to the fact that I had really good insurance that kept paying and partly due to the fact that I had an awful doctor who didn't recognize the signs of akathesia (the urge to constantly move), which only exacerbated my insanity. Here are some of my tips and survival techniques for this place:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- If you think the doctor they assign you is a buffoon, he probably is. Look up the reviews for the MD's who practice here. Namely, Dr. Klopper.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- If you hear them page Dr. Strongarm, it means someone is going ballistic. Watch for flying chairs and spit.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Know your rights regarding allowable time frames and the process for contesting involuntary treatment.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- If you're blessed enough to have the ""privilege"" of going to the dining room instead of eating on the unit, do it. You will have much better options if you do go to the cafeteria.  
&gt;  
&gt;**- Go to google and type in "" V. Ridgeview Institute "". You can search more by adding "" PDF "" or "" court "" after that to see all the cases they've been involved in. Most of their lawsuits have revolved around kidnapping (keeping a patient when they're not under an order to be involuntary) or just crappy treatment. They are not known to be an institution that vigorously protects patients rights and this will give you an idea of what you might be up against.**  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Check the Composite Board of Medicine to see if your doctor has had board orders for negligent or otherwise crappy treatment. Several of the doctors there see so many patients, so quickly, that you're just a number and something they can bill on.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- If this is the case, request (demand) a change of physicians. There are a few good ones there and you'll know who they are pretty quick. Listen to whether or not other patients think their MD is helpful.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- Under NO circumstances let them send you to cottage E (young adults addiction) if you're there as a psych patient. It was August when I checked in and the room had no AC. They shouldn't call this place a cottage: it's a storage unit for their overflow of young addicts. Comfort be damned! We slept with the lights on because of the roaches.  
&gt;  
&gt;\- If none of this works and they're still trying to pump you with drugs with awful effects, fake chest pain, get them to send you to the hospital, and then try to explain yourself to the ER MD. They usually have a different perspective and can spot someone who is over-medicated or improperly medicated quicker than most of Ridgeview's MD's can. The local ER knows which Ridgeview MD's frequently over-prescribe.  
&gt;  
&gt;I will say that once I got to the day hospital, I had a really good experience. They keep you really busy and help you with coping mechanisms. They really helped me with mindfulness and reframing my problems. I had a great small group counselor (Jamie) who kept my crazy self in check. I heard similarly good things about the other therapists in the day hospital.  
&gt;  
&gt;Overall, I'd give my MD a D- for failing to see that I was suffering serious side effects from medication, just being a general jerk, and rarely ever coming to see me. I also think he kept me there simply because I had good insurance. I'd give my therapist and most of the other staff an A or B. A good place, but sometimes you really have to be a jerk to these people to get the point across.  
&gt;  
&gt;Know your rights and don't be afraid to advocate for yourself. **When all this fails, call the Ombudsman. They should have the number posted somewhere on the unit. If they don't, gently remind them that it's a state regulation and ask them to provide it to you.**

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the rest are more of the same. There are a couple of 5-star reviews... but they don't feel real. They're pretty much all like this all the way back to 2015. Some people have been helped by this. Most, apparently, have not. Think of this before you sign any papers.

It does not represent anything except for an average of numbers which are averages of other numbers. It does not define who you are or what you can accomplish. 

I, like many of you, was in the top of my class in high school. Math and science came easy to me, and it took very little work to do well. Flash forward to now, and I'm grateful to get Cs on my transcript, and the potential to fail is a looming possibility. 

Too often, I see people worry about their GPA like it will make or break their career. I've seen people with lousy grades go to some amazing places, because they were able to show that they were more than just an average of averages. Find what makes you stand out, and pursue it. I've found in my own pursuits that the work you do outside of the classroom is just as important (or possibly more important) as the work done inside the classroom. A perfect grade in circuits doesn't mean you can apply the knowledge in the real world. 

This school is hard. Harder than most. Using your grades as a measure of self worth is like saying that Michael Collins was a failure because he never stepped onto the lunar surface like Neil and Buzz. At the end of the day, just by being here, you are miles ahead of almost every other engineering student in the country.

Our lab focuses on the research and development of technologies aimed at helping those with disabilities. For this project, we are using pressure mats to measure information about the participant's posture while they are seated on a wheelchair cushion.

Eligible participants must be:

1. A current wheelchair user
2. Aged 18 years or older
3. Able to transfer on and off their chair independently

Participating in this study involves a single 90-120 minute visit to our lab at Georgia Tech's campus. We would have the participant transfer off their chair, attach the weight shift sensor underneath their cushion, place a pressure mat on top of the cushion, and have them transfer back to their chair. During the study, the participant may be asked to move in their chair and shift their weight at various times. As a thank-you for participating, we will send every participant a $20 gift card. As an additional part of the study, the sensor mat may be left in the participant's cushion for 1 or 2 days in order to record their normal, everyday movement.

If you are interested in participating or have any questions about the study, please feel free to contact us! More info on our lab is available at [http://rearlab.gatech.edu/](http://rearlab.gatech.edu/) if you are curious about what we do."

Today in one of my classes, this Korean guy who it seems to have grown up in the United States was making a joke to a couple of Caucasian students in the classroom saying that ""it is a fact that all Asians look the same"". This resulted in about two or three Caucasian students cracking up while everyone else in the room remained silent (This was before the instructor stepped in). Now as a fellow Asian American, I didn't think it was okay for the Asian guy of Korean descent to say this. In this situation, I lacked the courage to speak up just like the many other Asian and Koreans in the room. I think it is unfortunate that situations like these still happen even though it is 2019. Just because one identifies as part of a minority group, doesn't give them the right to demean their entire group to come off as the ""cool"" minority dude or something like that. I believe that as Georgia Tech students, we should consistently strive to be mindful of our words and actions in the classroom to create a safe space for all Yellow Jackets to thrive."

I just bought breakfast for me and my friend at Brittain to go before our first lecture. I got food that requires utensils to eat, like two of the items were yogurt. As I leave I grab a few utensils bc that’s what I estimate the two of us need, but I get stopped by the lady working the entrance register and asked “Do you think you support us?” She basically says that if everyone acted like me then there would be enough utensils to go around and that I can only get one. I try to clarify I’m buying for multiple people so I need multiple utensils, but she just says I see you still don’t understand. So I try to give them back but she says no you’ve already touched them. She then ends up dismissing me after I ask again if I can really only get one utensil if I’m getting multiple items for multiple people by saying “You’re still not understanding me, so goodbye. Have a good day”

So my question is, is the utensils limit that important? Is it my fault bc I didn’t limit myself or am I justified in being upset bc I was sassed over utensils when I pay out of state tuition that certainly includes having food and things to eat it with?"

Our undergraduate president, Evan Gillon, decided that he is not comfortable signing this bill until more data is collected from the student body regarding their opinions on this issue, especially after hearing a general consensus from y'all that not enough polling was done prior to voting. As such, we have opened a student survey on our elections website to collect data on this front. This data will be used by Evan to decide whether or not there is enough student support for this bill to sign and pass it or veto it.

Due to these probabilities, it is reasonable to assume there exists a subset of Georgia Tech graduates who are millionaires and have made at least one meme, thus disproving Mr. Cole's assumption that meme making and wealth measured in millions are mutually exclusive.

Georgia Tech mourns the loss of student-athlete Brandon Adams, who died on March 23 in Atlanta. He was 21.

Adams was a business administration major and rising senior football student-athlete. Off the field, he spent the summer of 2018 interning for the world-renowned Georgia Tech Research Institute.

Born Dec. 22, 1997, Brandon Alonzo Adams is survived by his mother, Lisa Greer, stepfather, Reginald Woods, and sister, Rian. Memorial information is not available at this time.

“All of us here at Georgia Tech send our deepest condolences to the family and friends of Brandon Adams,” said Georgia Tech President G.P. “Bud” Peterson. “We ask that you keep them in your thoughts and prayers.”

Adams played in 33 games over three seasons as a Yellow Jacket from 2016-18. He recorded 41 career tackles, 6.5 tackles for loss and two forced fumbles as an interior defensive lineman. He was coming off a career year in 2018, when he amassed 24 tackles, five tackles for loss and two forced fumbles in 13 games (all career highs).

“On behalf of the entire Georgia Tech athletics family, I offer my deepest condolences to Brandon’s family and friends, including his past and present coaches, and his brothers in the Georgia Tech football family,” said Todd Stansbury, Georgia Tech director of athletics. “As we mourn the loss of such an incredible young life, we are also here to support Brandon’s family and friends, his past and present coaches and his brothers within the Georgia Tech football family in any way that we can. Please join us in keeping Brandon and everyone who loved him in your thoughts and prayers during this difficult time.”

A Brentwood, Tennessee, native, Adams was a three-sport star at Brentwood Academy (football, wrestling, track and field). He served as captain for Brentwood Academy’s football and track and field teams that both won state championships during his senior year (2015-16). In all, he earned 11 high school letters (four in football, four in track and field, three in wrestling) and helped lead four Brentwood Academy teams to state titles (football – 2015; track and field – 2013, 2015 and 2016).

“Our entire Georgia Tech football family is heartbroken by the news of Brandon’s passing,” said Geoff Collins, Georgia Tech football head coach. “In the short time that I have had the privilege and honor of knowing Brandon, I admired and respected him, first and foremost as a terrific human being, but also as an outstanding teammate and leader. Jennifer and I offer our thoughts, prayers and unconditional support to his parents, Lisa and Reginald, his sister, Rian, and all of his family and friends, particularly his brothers in our football program.”"

b086vl,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/b086vl/dont_underestimate_the_importance_of_hobbies/,Don't Underestimate the Importance of Hobbies,213,15,2019-03-12 07:07:59,"I graduated from Tech almost four years ago, but I still hang around this sub because you guys are awesome (and I love the memes). I do see all the posts complaining about Sodexo (trust me, it's always been this bad), grades, Willage, CPJ (no more thankfully), but I also see the posts about students struggling with depression and anxiety - just like I did.

&amp;#x200B;

I was as stereotypical a Tech student as could be - relatively big fish in the small pond of my high school, didn't have great study habits, quickly drifted away from my high school friends. As my GPA started to crash, so did my self-esteem.  I retracted socially, preferring to stay at home under the guise of 'needing to study' because leaving my room made me feel guilty that I was having fun, instead of studying.  It became a vicious cycle, and constantly pushing away my friends led to them - understandably - not engaging with me as much.  It was lonely, I was scared, depressed, anxious, and unable to ideate a life past graduation. I played a lot of video games; LoL, WoW, Diablo 3, Fallout.  I knew it was a distraction but it didn't give me satisfaction.  I just wasn't excited about anything anymore, and I thought it was because of the depression for a long time.  Looking back, I think a large part of it was I was lonely and I wasn't fostering a positive environment, and the depression was a symptom rather than a cause. 

&amp;#x200B;

My fifth year was a rough one, but I managed to make a friend who ~~forced~~ encouraged me to try out LARPing (Live Action RPG).  I was really dubious and I wasn't sure if I would have enough time - because how could I sacrifice an entire weekend to not studying?  Ultimately I decided to give it a try, because I figured that taking a weekend off wouldn't hurt, when typically I'd just hide in my room and play WoW anyway. So one cold weekend in late October, a packed a bag and went to hang out with a bunch of people I'd never met before at a state park I'd never been to before. And I loved it! I met people from all over and from all walks of life, and interacting with them was easy because we all had the common ground of doing the same activity.  I was participating in the geekiest thing in the world but I was quickly making more friends than I ever had on campus. I came back to the next subsequent events.  It gave me something to look forward to, finally something to be excited about.  People to talk to about being excited - people who wouldn't bring everything back to school and classes and the negative spiral of talking to people at Tech.  It was such a positive environment it became my escape from the negativity of school and GPA and the 'one up' culture of Tech.  I gained a lot of confidence and my grades got better because of it.  

&amp;#x200B;

I think the difference is, when you're trying to make friends in class, everyone is there to study, to learn, or to pass the class.  When you're participating in a hobby, you're there for the reason of having fun.  It puts people in a better mood.  Specifically in my case, it was very good for me to get off campus and get out of the Tech Bubble, because I helped me remember there is life beyond North Ave to 10th Street.  I made friends with a more diverse group and it gave me the support system I needed to get out of Tech in one piece.  

&amp;#x200B;

So please, don't be afraid to try something new.  You might feel like you're drowning, but you *can* graduate and you *can* be happy again. Also, hobbies don't need to look good on your résumé, you can devote energy to things because they are fun. It doesn't have to be LARPing (although the game I play is \[Xadune\]([https://xadune.com/](https://xadune.com/)) if you're interested), but having a regular, non-school activity to look forward to will help you in all aspects of your life. Bonus points if it gets you out of your room and away from your comfort zone.  


I know Tech sucks, I've been there, and I really hope this posts helps someone who is struggling.  Have a great Spring Break everyone!

You can find the post at:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/9f32pw/psa\_culc\_starbucks\_is\_charging\_higher\_prices\_than/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/9f32pw/psa_culc_starbucks_is_charging_higher_prices_than/)

Here's what I've observed since six months ago:

* I was very wrong to assume drink prices would be generally raised. It appears this issue is, more likely, based on human error when setting drink prices.
* Both the CULC and Willage Starbucks locations are overcharging on coffees. 
* It seems some Starbucks employees are aware of this price discrepancy; once, an employee gave me the correct tall coffee price of $2.12 by instead charging me for a Stroopwafel.
* About a month ago, I talked to a person in the Dining office on the third floor of Willage and told them about this price issue. They wrote down my comment, but no change has been implemented as of yet.

I realize this is a fuss about a whole fifty cents, but ask yourself the following: do YOU want to get overcharged on a purchase by 25% because someone entered a price in the system wrong? 

And yes, I've taken my business elsewhere. The Panera in Willage covers nicely, when on West."

I don’t have a problem with 1 or 2 people practicing dance in the weight room with earphones on, but these dance teams are taking it too far. They often blast music when dancing, making it difficult to hear my music. I’ve seen groups of ~10 people dancing in there, they take up all the space, they get loud, and how is this even allowed? I mean it’s a weight room... like one of the first things you’re taught is to not play around in a weight room.. and they’re dancing.. I saw in another thread that a dancer fell over a treadmill while dancing. I’ve also seen someone walking around swinging this ~5ft pole, and this person was definitely more concerned with how they looked than their surroundings. 

I know there are a lot of dance teams and maybe it is difficult to find space, but a weight room should be the last place you practice in. I know North Avenue has made more rooms available to dancers, and there has to be some other place they can use on campus that isn’t a weight room."

Dear College of Computing community,

I am pleased and proud to welcome Charles Isbell as the next Dean of the College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

Charles has been a strong leader for our college community for some time. He helped design our award-winning Threads curriculum for undergraduates. He helped to create our OMSCS program. He is the founding executive director of the Constellations Center for Equity in Computing. And of course, he has served as our Executive Associate Dean.

He is also a top-flight researcher. Charles has won two best-paper awards for his work in artificial intelligence. He is a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery and of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence. He has also sat on multiple advisory boards for the NSF and for DARPA.

As I know all too well, the dean’s position for the College of Computing is one of the most challenging and rewarding jobs in the entire field. I look forward to seeing Charles rise to the challenge, and I will help him in any way that I can. I know that he can count on the entire community to do the same.

Best,

It's been pretty great so far and I'm happy to have gotten out of school finally, but I got a nice reminder about 2 weeks ago about the advantages you get by having a degree from Tech. Our team got its first big deadline of the year in these past 2 weeks and it kind of hit us like a truck in that we're going to have to work really hard and possibly some weekends in order to hit it. What surprised me is how eerily similar this feels to a hell week - more specifically, the kind of pressure you're put under and the decisions you have to learn to make when you're subjected to that kind of stress. I'm grateful because getting the Tech degree actually taught me to survive and thrive in these high pressure situations by knowing how to properly prioritize and delegate, and as a result I'm having a much better time making a name for myself as the new guy who's only been at the job for 2 months but is getting shit done. Same goes for the other GT grads on my team, we all have and have maintained a really good reputation in the eyes of our management and the company as a whole.   

We love to complain about Tech's downsides but it hasn't even been a year and I'm already so glad to be an alum of this school. Keep going at it! The payoff is worth it for sure."

We've had a lot of questions about what ended up happening with the possibility of a public dining situation on campus as well as the dining contract. Apologies for this not being posted sooner, I wanted to ensure that I was allowed to post this information and things were a bit crazy with finals. This is a long post, so bear with me.

Our ability to do anything with public dining was dependent on the decision regarding the Sodexo lawsuit over the RFP process that GT conducted this past year (see: [https://www.ajc.com/news/local-education/lawsuit-targets-georgia-tech-handling-campus-dining-contract/W0UYbStCKm1KcOY6lavAqN/](https://www.ajc.com/news/local-education/lawsuit-targets-georgia-tech-handling-campus-dining-contract/W0UYbStCKm1KcOY6lavAqN/)  for more info on that). 

In late April, the Department of Administrative Services for the state of Georgia ruled to uphold a denial of Sodexo's protest surrounding the RFP process, leading to Georgia Tech moving forward with Aramark to finalize a contract (see:  [http://ssl.doas.state.ga.us/PRSapp/bid-documents/19503002019-RFP-SERVS-0006236410.PDF](http://ssl.doas.state.ga.us/PRSapp/bid-documents/19503002019-RFP-SERVS-0006236410.PDF)). 

During our discussions with GT, we brought up the fact that many students were still hoping to see something come out of the public dining resolution from this past semester. We were told that in the instance that Aramark's contract is not renewed (technically, it is a 1 year contract that has been guaranteed to be renewed 14 times unless Aramark fails to meet contractual obligations and expectations) that we could then come in and *potentially* make self-operated dining services happen. This is a very big if, and ideally we'd like to see Aramark come in and blow us out of the water. The biggest barrier we ran into this year with getting self-op implemented was that GT had already completed an RFP and made a decision when the resolution was passed (and even when it was written), at which point it becomes difficult for them to legally back out of anything.

With regard to the contract itself and Aramark's expectations, we asked that GT write into the contract expectations that Aramark work with the student body in order to ensure they are fulfilling student needs as well communicate effectively with those utilizing the dining halls. 

Some things this will include:

* They will be required to hire a minimum of 5 student ambassadors to
   * Explain meal plan usage/options
   * Foster relationships between the GT community and Aramark
* Student roundtables, held in the fall and spring semesters
* ""At the Table Events,"" during which Aramark will host a family-style meal with students in order to elicit feedback and opinions about on-campus dining
* Participation and Engagement with student organizations, including, but not limited to:
   * Student Government (no collusion, we promise)
   * Residence Life
   * Sustainability
   * Greek Life
   * If there are any others you would like me to propose or ask that Aramark work with, please let me know!
* Monthly participation in a Student Advisory Board that Aramark will help to build and coordinate and will include dining ambassadors as well as student representatives
* A yearly dining survey. The initial one, conducted in fall 2019, will serve as a benchmark and subsequent years will be compared to this. This survey will be used to gauge the needs and opinions of the student body as well as set goals for upcoming years
* Electronic monitoring of student engagement, which will be used to gauge the level of engagement with the student body as well as determine average student opinion on quality and overall satisfaction

Moving forward, we have been asked to help play a part in creating a committee to serve as advisers to administrators in the area of Campus Services as well as Aramark. If this is something you would be interested in, please send us a message and let us know!

Please note that this is just a start- while it may seem very sparse and vague right now, the terms of the contract will be reviewed yearly and there is definitely room for things to be added or changed. If you have any questions or input, let us know! While we didn't sit in on the meetings during which this contract was written, we would be more than happy to bring y'all's questions to administrators and plan to continue to work with them this next year to ensure that student begin to feel confident that they can get high quality food that meets their dietary needs. 

This will be my last time posting from the SGA Reddit account, as I can't hold my new SGA position and still be a part of PR- I'll be following this thread to answer any questions but after that point I'll be posting any updates from a personal account or having our awesome new PR committee members post on my behalf. If you have any concerns or questions at all, please still feel free to send us a message or tag us and we'll do our best to get back to you! 

Thanks for being so fun to work with this year, both on campus and on Reddit, and I hope you all have a fantastic summer! We can't wait to keep working with all of you next year!"

As my time with you comes to an end, there comes time to reflect on my journey with you.  When I came to your campus in middle school while my older sister was here, I instantly fell in love and knew I wanted to come here for college.  Fast-forward four years later, you welcomed me with open arms into your family.  Little did I know, however, how much I would treasure my time with you.  My journey here may not have been the smoothest with group projects, tough midterms, and late nights aplenty, but I am all the better for it.  You have helped turn a naive 18-year-old kid into a battle-tested problem solver ready for whatever the world throws at him.  You've also given me more than just an invaluable education.

You gave me resources to further my career and professional education through co-ops and internships

You gave me outlets to explore my interests in cybersecurity through elective classwork and extracurricular activity.

But most of all, you gave me an outlet to keep my passion for music and sports alive: the Georgia Tech School of Music.

When I first got to campus and auditioned for my first college concert ensemble, I assumed it would be just like high school: learn some new pieces, perform with some really talented musicians, and have a time to keep my mind clear of the worries of academics.  What I did not realize, however, was the strength of the School of Music community.  What started out as a simple membership in the Symphonic Band quickly became a gateway to something greater.  Through Symphonic Band, I met so many talented musicians and some of the coolest people on campus.  They successfully convinced me to join the Yellow Jacket Marching Band, which let me meet even more amazing people and forge new memories that I will cherish for a lifetime.  As a result, these experiences strengthened my love for you to the point where I am not ready to leave.  
Unfortunately, that time fast approaches.  So as I prepare to enter my final semester with you, I cherish every moment I have spent here.  From grinding out the last few lines of code for a programming project or the last few paragraphs of a written assignment, to cheering on the Yellow Jackets to some of their greatest victories, and everything in between, it has truly been an experience to behold.  Here's to more memories in one last push for glory before graduation as I prepare to close one chapter of my life and open another.

O Scion of the Southland, in my heart you shall forever fly.

Sincerely:
An ever-grateful son of Tech."

This is an update to members of the Georgia Tech community regarding the security incident experienced by Georgia Tech, about which you have received previous communications. Georgia Tech is notifying 1.265 million people and offering credit monitoring and identity theft protection services to individuals whose Social Security number was involved in the incident. This message explains the incident, measures we have taken to address the security issues, and some steps that individuals can take in response. Given our commitment to transparency and communications with our employees, we want to make sure you have the facts. 

What happened?
In late March 2019, Georgia Tech identified signs that an unauthorized person had found a way to send queries through a Georgia Tech web server to an internal database. Georgia Tech immediately implemented its incident response protocol, took steps to secure the web server, and began an investigation to determine what records in the database were accessed. The U.S. Department of Education was notified, and Georgia Tech set up a dedicated website on April 2, 2019, to share its preliminary findings.  

Leading forensic firms were engaged to assist in the investigation and help determine the specific information that was accessed. The investigation determined that access to the database may have occurred between December 14, 2018, and March 22, 2019. The information contained in the database that may have been accessed includes name, date of birth, Social Security number, and Institute ID number. Our investigation has concluded, and we are in the process of providing written notice to certain members of our community.

What are we doing to address this?
Georgia Tech is notifying 1.265 million people and offering credit monitoring and identity theft protection services to individuals whose Social Security number was involved in the incident. To help prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future, we are taking steps to enhance existing security measures.  

What should I do if I receive questions?
In the event you receive questions about the incident, please direct individuals to the call center we set up at 855-543-5399, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., Eastern Time. And, in the event you are contacted by a member of the media, please state that any media requests should be directed to Institute Communications, and then immediately notify Institute Communications about the media inquiry.  

Thank you for your continued dedication. 
 

Sincerely,

Jim Fortner

Funny enough, apparently it's only the rooms that are suffering from this problem because the hallways have been air conditioned just fine.

Like, it's hot and humid during the summer. If this was going to be a problem, why stick us in here knowing this could potentially happen again and might take weeks to fix? Coming back every day to an extremely hot and humid room really isn't ideal for sleeping and studying since I end up becoming a soaked mess within a fairly short period of time.

As a community, I have noticed we have started becoming rather toxic towards people asking for help this past year or two. New students have their questions downvoted to the shadow realm, and I actually just saw a parent's question receive snarky responses instead of actual answers - totally unwarranted.         

Put yourself in these guys' shoes: we have new freshmen and/or concerned parents that are curious as to certain aspects of GT and are not sure how they work. Therefore, they decide to ask for help/advice on one of the largest (if not the largest) online communities available for GT. And instead of receiving help, they are essentially told their question isn't worth our precious time. Seriously, what kind of a message does that send to these kids and their parents?        

Now I need to pause for a moment here and note a few things. First off, most of the posts end up receiving help in the end, regardless of if they are downvoted or not, so kudos to most of you guys. Secondly, you are right: 99% of the questions submitted have been asked beforehand and have most likely been answered as well. I totally understand how frustrating it is to see ""What LLC is right for me?"" for the 15th time in one day.         

However, regardless of how annoying these posts are, these people are still asking for help and advice. If their question has already been answered then simply tell them! If you have the time, maybe link them to the original question. Just don't mock them. Even if someone else answers their post, your hostile comment still makes them feel very unwelcome. You don't have to be a dick to correct someone...        

Alright that's all for now folks. Hopefully some of you feel the same."

She was nice enough but curtly explained that the building is completely off-limits to anyone who does not work there and escorted me out (..before I even got to see the staircase :( ). I find it very lame that this $400 million ""innovation hub"" funded in part by our institution that we pay heavily for is ""off limits"" to us.

I've since spent several years learning how to better care for fish and aquariums, and while I'm still no expert, I've really gotten into it! Turns out there's a lot of cool science and problem-solving behind a beautiful healthy aquarium. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, now I'm looking for people who be interested in starting and/or joining an Aquarium Club where members can learn about keeping aquariums, share ideas and questions, and sell/trade aquarium things with other members. No experience necessary - I'd like things to be very beginner-friendly and non-intimidating :) Let me know if you'd be interested!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

EVENT IDEAS: 

Make a betta tank: Hold a workshop where people can make their own heated, filtered, 5-gal betta tank and learn about caring for it. After several weeks, hold a stocking event when tanks are cycled for people to pick out a betta fish. Try to prevent sad fishies like Chester.

&amp;#x200B;

Make a planted snail/shrimp tank: Similar to the betta tank workshop, but for tiny tanks (2ish gal) that are not so suitable for fish. Introduce people to aquascaping, the use of natural plants, wood, and stones to create really nice tanks!

&amp;#x200B;

Q&amp;A with a Local Fish Shop day: Invite staff from a local fish shop (we have several great ones in the area!) to give a presentation and/or answer questions. Members could ask about issues they're having with their own aquarium and get  a professional's feedback.

&amp;#x200B;

CLUB SERVICES:

Aquarium feedback &amp; water tests: Members can show off photos of their aquarium, ask questions (or be asked questions), and get feedback. We could have a few master water test kits for member to test their water &amp; talk about fixing anything that looks off. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sales/Trade: Members can bring fish, plants, equipment, etc. to sell or trade with other members

&amp;#x200B;

Babysitting: Organize a system for members to care for eachothers' aquariums when people are traveling for extended periods of time. Perhaps the club could provide an incentive for babysitting someone's tank."

I've always loved this area on campus, the fountain adds such a nice feature to the center of student activity. It not only provides a scenic spot but also some nice white noise while studying or eating outside. Not to mention the nice little mist you get if the wind is in your favor.

Now don't get me wrong, I like brick. Brick is cool. It's red, and that's cool (Although not as cool as white and gold), it's hard, it makes cool noises when you bike over it, and it's reasonably durable. But FOUNTAINS, man, water is just sooo much cooler than brick, don't ya think?

With all the effort tech has put into making campus look less sterile, I can't help but think this is a massive step backwards. I just don't get it...

If you're like me, you recently received an email of the itemized damages of your room after moveout. The Standard was obligated by law to give us this list no more than 3 days after moveout, for my case it has been 15 days. For this reason, we are obligated to our full deposits without any withholdings.

So I ask that you, if you had any of your security deposit withheld, respond to their itemized damage email with this template (or something similar if you'd like):

Hi, 


Georgia Law requires this itemized list be sent within 3 days of move out (pursuant to OCGA 44-7-33 section b). 


According to 44-7-35 section b: ""The failure of a landlord to provide each of the written statements within the time periods specified in Code Sections 44-7-33 and 44-7-34 shall work a forfeiture of all his rights to withhold any portion of the security deposit or to bring an action against the tenant for damages to the premises.""


For this reason, I request the entire deposit be returned to me. Otherwise, I will have to pursue payment in small claims court.


Have a good one,

The offending language runs counter to our commitment to diversity and inclusion, and we condemn the use of it as it does not reflect who we are or who we strive to be.

There's a lot I want to say but I don't really know how to put every different thing into words so I just wanted to touch on a few things for now and hear your thoughts; it'll be a bit scattered as I type

(1) ""Who are you when nobody's watching?"": this is something I keep hearing/reading as I ""attempted"" to do self-reflection and put myself into a healthier mindset this summer. Who are you when you're off social media? Who are you when you're not stressing over grades because of family expectations or your own perceived expectations from friends that looked up to you as the ""smart"" person and fear of them losing that image of you? When did you find and where do you derive your passion?

I find myself not knowing what I like to do, both in terms of academic passion and non-academic hobbies and I know we all have to start somewhere but I feel like anything I pick up, I drop relatively quick because I don't see progression and there aren't enough checkpoints of growth that give that dopamine rush to push onwards. Most days, my mind just feels really cloudy and I can't find myself to do anything. The exception being when it comes to study for school, albeit I do procrastinate but then that fear kicks in--fear of failure--and my mind feels more active all of a sudden as I'm studying subjects where the material seems fascinating, but I don't find myself enjoying because my motive is fear. I realized that it was the same thing in high school and perhaps because of that, I never really found a passion---everything was fear-driven. I feel like I'm at that age where I should have at least 1 hobby that I'm ""good"" at and enjoy but I don't.

(2) I want to help people but the fear of being bad at it or negatively affecting the people I want to help stops me, both because I feel so inexperienced in everything but also so damn socially awkward/anxious and quiet.

(3) I'm a part of a program that I don't feel like I belong. I'm grateful for the opportunity but I can't help but feel imposter syndrome and often times, guilt. That they ""made a mistake"" when accepting me, that maybe I unintentionally lied on my applications/interviews and made myself appear as this figure that I don't feel like I am, that I may have deprived someone who actually is worthy. I thought, the guilt will make me want to work harder and prove my worth but that brings back to pt. 2 where I'm scared of hurting people I want to help/sounding stupid or misinformed that I found myself withdrawing more than ever. All these fears made me really detached from everyone there, fear of being ""exposed"" as an imposter."

It's that time again. ~~Temperatures are falling~~ ... ~~the pollen has gone away~~ ... it's August. The Atlanta Falcons are losing preseason games and the fall semester is upon us. Whether you're dragging yourself back to campus or showing up fresh from FASET, you're gonna have some tough spots this semester. As someone who Got Out\^tm last year, I thought I'd do some research on some helpful tips and share it with you.

**1)** Make a planner. Maintain the planner. Love the planner.

Either get a paper planner, use Google Calendar, or scratch it into your NAVE roommates door - I don't care, just set up a planner. First put in your class times (and locations, cause you'll forget), then any other things you have going on like work, clubs, and Sandstorm meditation. You should also schedule (yes, schedule) time for sleep - I'll come back to why in a second. Next, I'd suggest scheduling one or two weekly blocks of time where you go somewhere and do whatever work you need to do that week. Lastly, block off a little ""you time"", cause taking care of yourself is important too. You shouldn't strive for 100% productivity.

Why should you do this? A recent meta-analysis of 94 independent studies showed that people who made a plan of what/when/how they would take goal-directed actions were more likely to stick to those actions, avoid negative influences, and recognize goal-related opportunities [\[1\]](https://kops.uni-konstanz.de/bitstream/handle/123456789/10973/06GollwitzerSheeran_ImplementationIntentionsAndGoalAchievement.pdf?sequence=1).  If you choose not to use a planner, well, you'll find out the meaning of Hell Week/Month soon enough.

**2)** Start building good habits. Like right now.

You ever notice how you get to finals week and even though you actually kinda want to study so you can crack that B range, you just can't seem to pull yourself away from rewatching the Japanese dub of King of the Hill to do it? That's because you didn't build up the habit of regular studying throughout the semester, so your subconscious mind is resisting it and it feels uncomfortable.

You have something some call a ""subconscious homeostatic impulse"" - this isn't a widely accepted scientific term, but I'm trying to keep this short [\[2\]](https://medium.com/goalcontrol/your-subconscious-mind-determines-your-comfort-zone-heres-how-to-take-charge-of-both-710e66250830). Essentially, you have well-established neural pathways relating to your frequent behaviors and actions, which take less thought and energy. Your brain would really like you to keep taking those actions because it uses up a lot of energy overall and those actions have kept you alive so far. Lucky for us, this works both ways. You can make your brain prefer habits that help you, but you have to start a little earlier than November to really reap the benefits come finals.

**3)** Sleep. Please.

Look man, I've been reading Matthew Walker's Why We Sleep and it's basically scared me straight as far as sleep is concerned. Apparently, sleep deprivation is literally **the problem**. Jokes aside, not getting enough sleep causes a plethora of negative side effects on your body and mind. One of them directly related to Ma Tech is how it impacts our ability to learn - we can hold some info in our short term memory, but to really bake those goods in there, we need to store it in long term memory via memory consolidation.

An important factor of memory consolidation is sleep - specifically, stage 2 NREM sleep, which we get most of during the first half of the night [\[3\]](https://www.tuck.com/stages/). If you're staying up watching Shrek 3D until 4am every night, you're missing out on a lot of that stage 2 NREM sleep - even if you sleep late to compensate - and you'll have a reduced learning ability. This is one of the reasons why all-nighters are dumb and I hate them.

Anyway, that's all I have for now. Hope this helps someone. Follow these tips and the only nightmares you'll be having will be watching our football team trying to figure out how passing the ball works."

This school was named ""Clem"". Clearly, this is a terrible name for anything. It's curt and has no significance at all. After some years living through that nightmare of a name, the school newspaper proposed a new name that sounded a little more palatable and gave the name some meaning. The student paper settled on Clemson. The first four letters retained the supposed venerable history of the school, and ""son"" emphasized 3 core values of the students: Sitizenship, Onor, and Ntegrity.

Today, the Clemson students are still known throughout the world for their Sitizenship, Onor, and Ntegrity.

They walked right in front of cars, a bus, and a bicyclist and e-scooter going downhill; the e-scooter had to swerve and nearly hit the curb. It would have sent her flying into a tree or possibly skidding across the sidewalk. 

I understand that there's a very long gap between the pedestrian crosswalk at Ferst and Fowler and the crosswalk up by the Klaus deck, but there's not one there for good reasons:

1) Drivers coming up the hill CANNOT see you, and you can't necessarily see them either. Jaywalkers risk causing an accident if they attempt to cross when cars are coming up the hill.

2) Bicyclists and e-scooters can potentially be going too fast down the hill to stop in time if you walk out in front of them. This applies to cars to some extent, too.

Please don't risk causing an accident just to save a minute of walking time. If the bicyclists and e-scooters are following the rules of the road, so should we as pedestrians."

The Yellow Jacket Space Program (YJSP) is developing Georgia Tech's first liquid fueled rocket program, and we're completely student run. Every design, every piece of hardware, every line of code, and every test is created and run by us - the students. Come help us create a liquid fueled rocket to go to outer space.   

If you're interested in gaining hands-on experience developing rocket systems, come to our info session on **Thurs.** **September 5** in **Mason 5134** from **6-7 PM.**  There, we'll talk about all of our openings as well as what it's like to be part of the club.  This info session is open to all current students at GT.

We are looking for dedicated students of all majors and all academic levels to help us out on the following teams:

* Avionics: Help design, build, and test all of the electrical hardware and software systems in our rockets, from the engine controller to the flight computer.
* Flight Dynamics: Develop guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) algorithms to enable active-control flight of our rockets.
* Operations: Grow relationships with current and potential corporate sponsors.
* Propulsion: Use advanced machining techniques to build and test our student-designed liquid rocket engine capable of producing up to 3500 N of thrust.
* Structures: Design and build the physical rocket bodies capable of carrying our electronics and propulsion systems to space.

There is NO dress code - we're all students, and it's way too hot to take things formally. We're looking forward to meeting you!

d3m8jx,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/d3m8jx/what_gt_does_when_you_have_a_mental_breakdown/,What GT does when you have a mental breakdown.,350,42,2019-09-13 01:29:37,"First off, I don’t want to scare anyone away from help.  Get help, but avoid campus resources for now.  You do not want them involved in your mental health;  find a private counselor, a good friend, a professor, or if you’re feeling worse than all of that:  Take an Uber to the hospital (PM me and I’ll even pay for the uber)

That having been said, here’s what you can expect if you let GT get involved:

In early spring ‘18, I was experiencing suicidal thoughts and I called the “counselor on call” at Georgia Tech.  I told them my situation and they *offered* a ride to Ridgeview institute.  I accepted, as an uber would have been expensive.  I could have said no and went home, meaning I was not an involuntary transport.  GTPD was chill and understanding, and we had good conversation on the way over.  But my mistake was that the GT bureaucracy was now involved.

My time at ridgeview was acceptable, and is not my main concern.  I worked honestly and exerted  effort with professionals I felt could make my mental health improve.  I was discharged 5 days later.  In my discharge paper, there was an exclusionary option for release of records; I filled it in with a few substances I was or had been on.  I signed the records to be sent to the GT counseling department, because I was told they’d want to do their own evaluation.

Upon my return, I was mandated to return to the dean of students before I could even attend class or return to a dorm.  Even before I could see the counselor I was required to see.  I set a meeting and the next day I arrived and she had in front of her my entire discharge manual.  This person, who had no medical or counselor training had my blood pressure, medicines, therapy notes, dietary observations, *and* the list of drugs I specifically prohibited to be on *ANY* discharge paper.

Her first words were “you need to get off of the xxxxx if you want to stay here.”  No “glad you’re better” “I hope you’re Ok.”

She asked me if I considered a retroactive withdrawal (withdrawing unconditionally from all classes for the semester), but I had professors who were willing to work with me over the coming summer to clean up the work I had missed.

I still don’t know where my discharge records are.  I missed the 180 day deadline to file a complaint to the HIPPA officials, so I guess I’ll never know.

tl;dr needed help, contacted GT, took their advice, got better, signed exclusionary discharge forms to counselors office, entire booklet ends up at dean of students’."
d4b6sk,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/d4b6sk/athletics_wont_let_the_band_play_on_third_down/,Athletics won’t let the Band play on Third Down,300,44,2019-09-14 14:18:12,"Out of all the stupidity going on with the football team, this has got me angrier than any. What self-proclaimed yellow jacket fan would want third down in Bobby Dodd to be quieter? I don’t even care about Money Down or whatever they play on the loudspeakers, MONEY DOWN AND THIRD DOWN CHORDS ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. That you have a volunteer organization of the loudest and biggest Georgia Tech fans in a prime section of the stadium, and then tell them to be quiet when the opposing offense converts third down after third down is idiotic. 


Having the band play chords on defensive third downs is what gets the fans in the entire stadium loud as well. When you have the people who practice hours every week to be as loud as they can silenced on GAMEDAY, you lose half of the volume and 100% of the atmosphere of college football in Bobby Dodd Stadium. Georgia Tech Fans were louder and more excited at the away game in Clemson (where we lost worse than the spread) than they have been for the past two HOME games. I was there for both, and the biggest reason why is because the band could play as loud as they wanted at an away game and can’t in their own stadium.


If you don’t want to hear the band support the atmosphere of college football at your home games, then you might as well stop funding them all together and replace them with the PA system. Go ahead and see if that will fill your North Stands when the football team loses to Citadel. If you’re going to fund a band, let them play often and loud. 


Third down chords are one of the band’s greatest traditions, and we better start recognizing what we had before it’s gone. Losing my ears and my vocal chords on defensive third downs is as much a part of the Yellow Jacket experience as dancing to Bud and the Horse. Honestly chords should be a part of T night every year."

I asked the employee if there were any tofu options and she told me that there was a tofu curry. However, once I started to eat it I realized that there was chicken in it. I went back to Umami to make the employee aware of this and she claimed there must have been a mistake and that it is tofu. However, the head chef overheard our conversation and said that they don’t serve tofu and that was a chicken curry. As I am allergic to meat, I’m lucky that I figured out that it was chicken after a bite or two. I didn’t know that they didn’t serve tofu as there was no menu up. I emailed multiple directors of food services over the past few days and haven’t heard back from them. I’m extremely disappointed in gt dining services and I’m lucky that I did not have an allergic reaction. I just wanted to post this to make all my fellow vegetarians, vegans, and dietary restricted peers aware that not all of the willage employees actually know what they’re serving and to double check their food/the menu."

If you have a history of mental illness, and feel like you might have some struggles this semester, go ahead, and look into booking your appointments now. The counseling center in my time was pretty good, despite the plethora of paperwork. The psychiatry department was objectively terrible though. If you're suffering from anxiety, or ADHD, don't even bother. I once saw a kid visibly suffering a panic attack, and they just told him to make an appointment. Back then, that was nothing short of a month long wait. The psychiatrist I had was extremely deceptive, and lazy. She heard that I'd been diagnosed with depression, even though I was there because I was more concerned with ADHD, and she didn't tell me that they were unable to actually prescribe anything for that. She put me on a dangerous dose of antidepressants that made me feel like a zombie. Find outside help if you can. After I left, it took two years of trying different psychiatrists, and after a particularly bad suicide attempt, I finally got diagnosed with bipolar, along with anxiety, and the ADHD I'd known about since I was five. I'm not going to tell you they don't care, but I will say that in my experience, they were understaffed, and dishonest about what they could do for you. I'm happy to say that I finally got the care I needed, but only after I moved home. I didn't finish my last semester at tech, but I finally got a degree. Don't let yourself get in a bad spot. Schedule early, and look for psych services off campus. That's my advice for the freshmen, and anyone else. Tech is a tough school, but you got in, and you can get out. Stay strong. Don't let what you worked so hard for fall apart last minute."

I want to bring you an update to last night’s message. It is with a heavy heart that I share with you that James Strock, a second-year student in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, passed away after a swimming accident yesterday.

James, who was originally from Uganda, moved to the United States at age 16. He worked hard to adapt and excelled academically, according to his parents. James was a computer engineering major and an active member of our campus community. He was an avid user of the Campus Recreational Center and attended campus ministry. He completed a co-op program with DataPath in Lawrenceville this past summer.

On behalf of Georgia Tech, we offer our deepest condolences to James’ family and friends during this difficult time. I have been in constant contact with his family and will continue to be there to support them.

This is a tragic loss, and I urge you take advantage of the counseling services that are available on campus. Grief counseling is available through the Counseling Center (counseling.gatech.edu) in the Student Services (Flag) Building from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. throughout the week and after-hours by calling 404-894-2575. Staff and faculty may find support through the Employee Assistance Program at hwb.gatech.edu/eap.

So within Georgia bikes must follow all traffic laws, such as not riding on the side walk, yielding to pedestrians, and stopping at stop signs. Recently I was issued a traffic violation for running a stop sign by Officer T. Foster for running a stop sign. This happened at the intersection of Ferst and Hemphill about 1 week ago. I fully admit that I broke the law, and now I will have to pay a fine, which I have no issue with. 

As a result I have now been much more careful with how I ride my bike and have done my best to follow traffic laws at all times when ridding my bike. I have also noticed Officer T. Foster has been regularly patrolling the intersection at Hemphill and Ferst as well as the intersection at State and Ferst (Right in front of the new Kendeda Building) and I have seen him stop bikers other than myself on two separate occasions. I don't know if I just wasn't aware of it before, but GTPD seems to be cracking down more of bikers this year especially, so I encourage all of you to be safe while you are riding and follow all traffic laws. Please learn from my mistakes."

I’m a second year at Tech, and right off the bat, my first year started off poorly. A lot of factors were at play, but perhaps the most notable is the fact that I had untreated Depression and Anxiety (and as I’d later find out, OCD and ASD). 


FIRST HOSPITALIZATION:

About a week after my 18th birthday, I set out pills to take with the intention of ending my life. I was so lonely, so hopeless, and overwhelmed in every aspect of my life. However, I started imagining what would happen if I took the pills, panicked, and called the counseling center instead. After telling them what was happening, I was told to come to their office in the flag building. I Ubered there as I was a mess and didn’t want to be seen on the bus. I didn’t pack anything except a favorite ring of mine, and my dad’s jacket that he passed down to me. 

When I got to the counseling center, I’d say it was maybe a 20 minute wait before I was called back into one of the therapists’ offices. A lady took notes as she asked me what was happening, and then she told me what a 10-13 was. Now, for you fortunate folks who *don’t* know, this is when you are involuntarily checked in to a mental health facility for a minimum of 72 hours and must be escorted to said facility (in my case, by GTPD in a squad car). Remember this for later. 

I panicked. I didn’t want my parents to know what had happened. I knew they’d be so upset with me. I begged the therapist not to make me go. I didn’t want to miss class, I felt like I was already behind! I didn’t have any extra clothes or possessions to take with me! 

I didn’t have a choice. I was sent off to Ridgeview in Smyrna, where I stayed for either 4-5 days (to be honest, I’ve tried to repress the memories of my time there so I don’t remember exactly how long it was).

It was awful. The staff as apathetic, we had to turn in everything (including my dad’s jacket and my ring), we couldn’t have any devices (which I somewhat understand, but since music is what calms me down most, this sucked), the group sessions were more traumatic than helpful, the food was awful, and I felt even worse than I had before. I remember on my first night that I was snapped at and sent to sit out in the hall for crying in my bed. 

Finally, I was given a prescription for a low dosage of Prozac and released. When I got back to campus, I had a couple hundred pages of reading, assignments, tests, and more to make up. Though the Dean of Students office was great about helping me arrange makeup work (Dean Riggle deserves tons of praise here), I still knew that missing so much class would hurt me. I don’t learn from reading textbooks. I learn from hearing lectures and demonstrations. 

SECOND HOSPITALIZATION:

It wasn’t long before I noticed that my medication didn’t seem to be working. I fell back into my depressive habits. I wasn’t sleeping, wasn’t eating, couldn’t get myself out of bed, and “those thoughts” started coming back. 

One night, a month after my first hospitalization, I was studying for a big test. I had missed multiple lectures in this class while I was gone and from physically not being able to get myself out of bed to go to class. I realized I felt completely unprepared, panicked, and felt so trapped that I could only see death as a way to get out of the situation. I tried to hang myself, but the attempt failed. 

My roommate heard me crying in my room (apartment style dorm). She didn’t know I had attempted, but she texted me and recommended that I go talk to the Sports Psychologist the next day. I did. With only the clothes on my back and my backpack, I went to their office. Apparently, they had already spoken to my roommate, and knew that I had been upset. They asked if I had been suicidal again. I tried not to panic. I knew what would happen if I told the truth. I’d be shipped away again, I’d get the same terrible treatment, I’d feel even worse again. I refused to answer the question. 

They told me that since they had concern about me hurting myself, I would need to go to a facility. However, I was assured that I could go get evaluated voluntarily and be driven by my coaches instead of the police. I agreed to this. A few minutes later, I’m suddenly told that, no, that’s actually not what’s happening, I’m being 10-13’d again. I ask, “Doesn’t that mean a mandatory 72 hours?” I’m told that no, it doesn’t. Everything is the same, I’ll just have to have the GTPD escort me again. 

I’m hesitant, but I don’t really have a choice. I’m led through the tunnels of Bobby Dodd and put into yet another squad car. This time I’m taken to Peachford in Dunwoody. I wait for about two hours until I’m called back to be evaluated. This is when I find out that I was, in fact, correct. Despite being previously told by Sports Psychology that I would not have to stay 72 hours, Peachford informs me that this is exactly what I will be doing. 

I break down in the evaluation room. I literally felt like I had been taken prisoner. My anxiety attack was so severe that the staff threatened to take me to the stabilization unit if I didn’t calm down. I wasn’t violent. I was scared. Imagine just thinking you’re going on a trip to the doctor and you’re suddenly told that you’re to be locked in an institution and aren’t allowed to leave or have any of your things, including a change of clothes, for days. 

It was like an actual nightmare. Thankfully, Peachford wasn’t quite as bad as Ridgeview. It was still bad, but the staff at least seemed less cruel, and the food was pretty good compared to the Ridgeview prison slop. One of the times that I got to use the pay phone, I called the Sports Psychologist and asked why I’d been given misleading information. I reminded them that I had explicitly asked if a 10-13 would be 72 hours and was told no. They told me that “Well, it’s supposed to be 72 hours, yes, but a doctor *could* release you early.” I asked the doctor about this, and was told that no doctor would ever do that, because a 10-13 was always 72 hours. I felt very lied to and betrayed. 

When I was released again, I decided that maybe some of my stress could be alleviated if I dropped a class. On top of this, I had mandatory therapy and psychiatry appointments. However, on a particularly rough day, I found myself needing counseling when I didn’t have a therapy appointment scheduled. I dropped by the counseling center instead. I was led down the hall of roaring white noise machines (which I personally dislike) and into a therapist’s office. I told her about what had happened, and how I felt overwhelmed with stress again. I was still struggling to sleep, and had been bouncing around on different prescriptions to see what actually worked, which was taking a physical toll. 

She looked at me and shrugged. 
“What do you want *me* to do about it?” 
I stared at her. 
“Pardon?”

I know this is a long post with details that probably nobody cares about. I’ve just been needing to get this off my chest. It wasn’t linear progress for me from there by any means. Lately, things have become overwhelming again, and I often feel very alone. I want to make friends, but feel like I’m more of an annoyance to people than a potential a friend. 

It hurts my heart every time I hear or read that GT loses another student. I know I don’t have all the answers to fixing the glaringly obvious issues surrounding mental health care at Tech, but I can say with absolute certainty that things will never improve if the attitude towards the issue is a shrug and a “What do you want *me* to do about it?” 

Maybe it’s up to us students. We need and deserve for this to be fixed. I’d like to encourage everyone to try to remind someone that they matter in a *personal way.* Also, some of you are already pretty good about this, but I think we should all be more open about talking seriously about our own mental health. I know with the good ol’ Gen Z humor it’s easy to just make memes about having depression, but if we all fight the stigma just a little bit with honest conversation and being willing listeners, I think it could make a world of impact. 

Some mental health days and more student-professor communication about mental health could also potentially do a world of good. 

If nothing else is fixing this, I guess it’s up to us."

It is with great sadness that I write today to inform you of the passing of Vamsi Konjeti. a second-year student in Mechanical Engineering from Brentwood, Tennessee.


I met with Vamsi’s family earlier today to express our deepest condolences on behalf of the entire Tech community. The loss of a classmate and fellow member of our community is difficult for all of us, but especially for the students and faculty that knew Vamsi best. 


Counseling services have been offered to Vamsi’s roommates and close friends. Please remember that Georgia Tech offers multiple services and resources in support of the community, and I urge you to take advantage of the counseling services that are available. Grief counseling and mental health support for students is available through the Center for Assessment, Referral and Education (care.gatech.edu) on the first floor of the Smithgall Student Services (Flag) building from 8 a.m. – 5 p.m. throughout the week and after-hours by calling 404-894-2575. Staff and faculty may find support through the Employee Assistance Program at hwb.gatech.edu/eap. 


If you are in need of immediate assistance, you can also contact the Georgia Crisis &amp; Access Line at 1-800-715-4225 which is staffed with professional counselors 24 hours per day, every day, to assist those with urgent and emergency needs. 


Please take care of yourselves and each other and keep Vamsi's family in your thoughts.

dijmvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/dijmvv/the_myth_called_achievement/,The myth called achievement,160,24,2019-10-15 20:45:55,"A significant percentage of the students at this school are truly struggling. It's not new and I'm glad people now feel safe enough to reach out to the community about it. I want to help, and this might be a message you **need** to hear.

If you're reading this as a fellow student, there's a good chance you've got a million things occupying your head at this very moment. Enough things to cloud judgement and distort thought. I'm asking you take a break from inside your head and zoom out to view your life from above.

What you might see is that you look like a point on a plane of the cartesian persuasion, located at what we call the present moment. It's got an infinite number of bumpy paths extending in all directions. Like... really bumpy--keep your arms and legs in the car at all times.

Every hill is a high in your life. Every valley is a low.

At our altitude, these might look small (not necessarily--I'm not trying to make light of tragedy). That embarrassing thing you did last week? Approximately every person except you forgot about it not even 10 seconds following. Got a job offer? You are a MF'ing G (I cannot emphasize this more, getting employed is the reason you *willingly* came to Tech!!). Same thing, though.

If you're like me, you have at *least* a few crippling insecurities. Times I've failed to perform. Making below average grades in my classes. Bombed every single one of my two phone screens this semester. I'm extremely into that girl, better play it cool and pretend like she doesn't exist (works every\* time). Is there a job ~~beyond retail~~ I'm... actually qualified for?

If you're like me, you probably want to change too. We all have an ideal image of ourselves we can visualize. Mine goes to sleep every night at a reasonable time, excited for the next day. Puts forth his best effort, in all things, irrespective of his emotional state. Has a 10.75 inch jimmy john... You get what I'm saying.

Let's call this ideal version of yourself Big-Dick-Energy-Chad-You (BDECY).

Why in the world do we all feel so rushed to reach this ideal? BDECY is mostly achievable. Look, I know 'Biggest-Dick-Icarus' (BDI) did it in 2 years while volunteering in Africa, but what does that have to do with you? It's possible you're a late bloomer and it'll be another 5 years? 10 years? 20? Who knows and who cares. It's entirely possible BDI had a helping hand, arm, *and* leg, or maybe not; It truly does not matter.

So your work hasn't impacted the lives of strangers yet. So not everyone likes you. So you've got noticeable flaws. So you've fallen way (waaaaaaaay) short of where you thought you'd be at this point in your life.

So... wait, why do we care about these things again?

If you're like me, your younger, ignorant self, often lauded as a (future) world-impactor, set up some self-expectations that don't make a whole lot of sense under closer scrutiny. 

**You've put all your self-worth eggs in the achievement basket.**

The truth is, it's an anomaly to drive up a steep mountain in the plane of reality and make it to the top without falling off and sustaining major trauma. Besides, once your altitude gets high, you have no choice but to keep moving up. *To stop is to fall all the way back down*. BDI is the one who's actually out of place. He will have to bust ass for the rest of his life just to *maintain* his position.

I'm going to challenge you to stop looking at paths leading up mountains and aim for something flatter. Look for a wide path rising slowly and steadily. Give yourself permission to fuck up. And be there to support yourself when it inevitably happens.

Don't totally let go of BDECY, but rather realize you may never reach that ideal, nor should you feel pressured to. Realize that BDI is exposing himself to a *dangerous* way of life. A way of life taking him to a summit, alone. **Any path that puts you above everyone else, by definition, leaves you there on your own.**

Now zoom back into the close view of your life. Take stock of your surroundings. Stop looking directly down or directly up. Instead look at the horizon and find a gentle slope leading up, but advance slowly, deliberately. You've got plenty of time to gain momentum before hitting the gas.

Determine your success, not based off of where you are, but based off of any small thing you did this day/week/month/year that moved you ever so slightly towards your ideal self. **Something that's trivial to everyone else might be huge for you.** And give yourself a pat on the back. You've made it this far.

**tl;dr: Stop focusing on who you think you should have been by now. Instead, pay attention to whether or not you're moving in a positive direction. Achievement is not a sustainable source of self-worth. When you let go of the need to be special, it will free you.**"

Stay on the right side please! I don't like being on the ride side and nearly getting hit by a bike. I understand that it's easier to sway left sometimes, and we're all tired or rushing because of stress, classes, social life, or whatever else you have going on.

I'm inspired by how passionate I've seen the students here are about mental health, and I hope that we can have a future here someday in which you can get access to a therapist and a psychiatrist and anything else you might need to be able to feel okay without so much stress and added (unnecessary) effort."

The $2,776 in mandatory fees Georgia Tech graduate students will pay this year are the highest among peer universities in the United States \[1\].  This is in part due to the Special Institutional Fee (SIF, currently $1,032 per year), which in 2015 was planned to be reduced until eliminated for graduate students, but has not been reduced since 2017.  These fees are a significant financial burden for graduate students supporting themselves on modest stipends, and are detrimental to the Institute's recruitment of top research talent.  


As a public university, Georgia Tech’s mandatory fees are set by the University System of Georgia Board of Regents based on recommendations from the president of Georgia Tech.  With the new Georgia Tech administration taking office this year, this is an opportune time to make the graduate student voice heard and call for a reduction in mandatory fees. Many faculty members have already voiced their concerns about high mandatory fees, and on October 22 the Faculty Senate will vote on a resolution calling for a reduction in mandatory fees for graduate students \[2\].  Graduate SGA has also been meeting with the Georgia Tech administration to express their concerns.  


However, the most powerful signal that fees need to be reduced should come directly from the graduate students themselves.  Please make your voice heard by signing the petition below, addressed to President Cabrera and his administration. The petition calls for the elimination of the SIF, for mandatory fees used for services not utilized by all graduate students to be made voluntary, and for the Institute to work to reduce other mandatory fees.  


**You can view and sign the petition here:** [**https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_4HlWV94I0G1G05v**](https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_4HlWV94I0G1G05v)  


**Please forward this message to your colleagues, and help us distribute the petition to as many graduate students as you can.  Our goal is for as many graduate students as possible to sign the petition by the Faculty Senate meeting on October 22.**  


Thank you,

I keep hearing life is not pointless, but I guess it just depends on who you are and what you do.  I don't feel my life is pointless but I also don't see the need of keeping it. I have good grades, no debts, a loving family, a lovely girlfriend, amazing working perspective yet something is missing. I still do not understand why I am doing this, why am I bothering to live this life? I feel like drowning while at the same time I smile at those around me who have not realised the emptiness I have inside. 

Emptiness, that is the word. I really do not know how you guys do it, if I was an undergrad here honestly I would have gone crazy already long ago. But here I am carrying on my  research without even understanding why I am doing it.  It is like when you wake up on a sunday morning during holiday season, you want to do something but you don't see any good reason to do anything and so you lay down waiting for someone to give you a motivation. 

I am happy you guys see all the motivations to keep carry on, but I just don't. I just don't see why I am doing this, is there a prize at the end of the road? is there anything that will be worthed living this? I am not sure, I don't think any god will give me any medal or reward for surviving a perfect on the outside life but yet miserable on the inside. 

I hope you guys feel better than I do, and if you don't seek for help."

Next semester I plan to take Math 2603 with Jing Hao and ISyE 3232 with Craig Tovey.


The issue is that Jing Hao is fairly new and from what I have heard about her she is terrible and her class is very hard.
I think my Multivariable Calculus class this semester was bullshit and the final was unnecessarily hard and I am tired of taking bullshit math classes that profesors make unneccessarily hard. Since this is her first semester at Tech I don't know if she curves grades or if the majority of students get terrible grades.

For anyone who took Jing this semester, should I drop or is a B possible with decent effort ?


Now onto Craig Tovey. Reading his rate my professor makes it seem like he is a nightmare professor.  He has been at Tech for over 20 years and on course critique some of his classes have extremely low GPA's( as low 1.83). However for 3232 his GPA seems kind of decent but has up to 20% of students withdraw from the class possibly inflating the GPA.



I have had a rough semester and I want some kind of relief. I am willing to work hard but I don't want a class where I have to give an A level effort and just spend the entire semester stressing just to pass.

I don't need to take either class next semester but in doing so I would be progressing in my degree. Tovey is not the only professor teaching 3232 but all the other ones are full and the waitlist are also almost full. Apparently Jing Hao is the only one teaching 2603 next semesrer.


Anyone who just took Jing Hao for 2603 or Tovey for 3232 should I drop either of these classes and wait a semester to hopefully take it with a better professor ?


Or is a B achievable with hard but not over the top work ?"

# SITUATIONAL AWARENESS

**SUBJECT:** Flash Flooding Risk Overnight

**SITREP #: 2020-4.1**

**ISSUED:** Monday, February 10, 2020 at 1530

**OVERVIEW**

The Weather Prediction Center issued a rare High Risk for excessive rainfall for our region this afternoon. This is due to a stalled frontal boundary over the northern half of Georgia that will produce significant rainfall overnight tonight in areas that already have saturated grounds. Storms may persist over the region overnight into Tuesday morning. While most models show the axis of higher precipitation amounts setting up to our north and west, the National Weather Service (NWS) is concerned that a slight change in that axis would shift it over Metro Atlanta. Additionally, flash flooding is most pronounced in an urban setting with much more impervious surfaces that produce runoff. Typically, the Georgia Tech campus remains safe in these events and we expect minimal impacts locally. Our main concern is with commuters and those that live in the NW Metro area, such as Cobb, Bartow, Paulding, northern Fulton, Cherokee, &amp; Forsyth Counties. Be especially careful driving overnight tonight as flooded roadways are often difficult to detect and may be much deeper than they appear. As always, follow the guidance of “Turn around, don’t drown.”

**PRIMARY HAZARDS**

The primary hazards will be from flash flooding.

**TIMING**

Monday Night into Tuesday Morning

**NEXT STEPS**

* The Georgia Tech Police Department Office of Emergency Management will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as necessary.

We are being let off due to ""budget changes"", and not due to any performance measures. According to my supervisor, this decision was made several weeks ago by upper-level Housing staff, which has failed to notify any SSMs in any capacity since the decision was made. Those who were laid off have not been added to the alternate pool of new SSM candidates (at least, not automatically), but are welcome to reapply to become an SSM next Fall. Not only this, but opening positions from graduating students have been filled by incoming applicants, meaning that new, untrained applicants are being preferred over SSMs that have worked for Housing for several years. It's honestly insulting. By waiting so long to let us know, Housing has made it difficult to find a place to live during the summer. The deadline to apply for on-campus housing is in less than a week and it is now much harder to find an affordable lease for off-campus apartments for the summer.

It has become clear that Housing no longer cares about its employees, and for that matter, the students of Georgia Tech as well. SSMs are a front line of defense for mental health and wellbeing of students. In laying off 60 SSMs, Housing has effectively reduced the ability for Georgia Tech to reach out to students in need. Housing has recently increased SSM responsibilities, such as requiring an additional duty round and for SSMs to record resident conversations every week. When asked why these changes were made, especially without an increase in pay to compensate, they simply cited that ""other schools had such policies."" I used to say that the only department worse than Housing was Dining, but honestly Aramark has shown vast improvements in terms of service and care that Housing has not. I am ashamed to have been a part of this organization."

GT Housing and its treatment of its employees and residents has gone downhill for the past 4 years I've been here. We are belittled, disrespected, and gaslit by our Hall Directors, Area Managers, and other professional staff. None of our concerns are ever listened to, and there is no stability in the department overall. The few times we ask for support from them, we're ignored or pushed aside.

The emotional toll that it takes to be an SSM is insane, and we aren't provided proper support when dealing with it. The number of cases of sexual assault, depression, homesickness, coming out, break ups, break downs, roommate conflicts, and just general bad days that I've seen myself and my fellow RAs/PLs go through on nearly a daily basis is unparalleled to any other department except for Counseling. The only problem is, we aren't trained or compensated fairly for this kind of work. We are pretty much volunteer triage counselors, and it takes a fucking toll when you add in your other clubs, jobs, classes, and personal issues.

Not only this, but they have the audacity to removed half of the PL positions across campus, leaving one PL per floor to deal with double the residents, duty shifts, and general bullshit on their own. The ""additional"" compensation they're providing for double the work is a joke, and they're even banning SSMs from having any kind of other job on-campus or off-campus unless it's research. 

I have loved this position like no other for the past 4 years, but I can't let this malpractice go unnoticed for any longer. If you're applying to become an SSM or considering returning to the position, please reconsider. **It isn't worth it. Period.** Putting in a decent number of hours a week at a part time job you enjoy would pay about the same while avoiding the stress and anger that we go through on a daily basis. The only way that anyone in Housing will ever listen to these issues is if they're starved of candidates and can't function, so please join in this good fight and spread the word.

Together, maybe we can move on from this era of shitty maintenance, overpriced housing, and staff neglect."

We are confident our students will rise to the challenge, and the USG will do everything in its power to help them do so. We trust our faculty to teach and grade students effectively.

In times of adversity, we should reach higher, not lower. Maintaining high academic standards is critical to the success of USG students now and in the future. Continuing letter grading for the final few weeks of the semester will allow faculty to assess the performance of students in the same manner as they always have. The USG is confident that faculty and students will rely on the resilience they have shown thus far and continue to meet our high standards.

While online instruction will be new to many, thousands of USG students and faculty have already experienced it through nearly 11,000 online course sections offered prior to USG’s temporary shift to all-online instruction. In addition, the USG has offered resources to assist faculty (https://www.usg.edu/keep_teaching_usg) and students (https://www.usg.edu/keep_learning_usg) make the transition."

Emory makes a sound argument. Here are some statements I liked:

""Students who endure extreme socio-economic and health-related hardship should not suffer academic consequences because they lack a financial safety net, stable access to internet or computer resources, or the well-being necessary for scholastic pursuits.""

""Universities’ responses to COVID-19 nationwide have had serious repercussions for all students, especially low-income and international students.""

""Pass-fail grading will disadvantage students with difficult living situations that hinder their academic performance."""

March 16, 2020
https://www.usg.edu/coronavirus
The University System of Georgia (USG) has decided that all 26 institutions will move to online instruction for all courses for the remainder of the semester with extremely limited exceptions. This action comes following last week’s decision to suspend instruction for two weeks to ensure business and instructional continuity, and to allow further state assessment of COVID-19.
Students are not allowed to return to campus until they receive permission from their institution, which will be forthcoming soon.
Additionally, residence halls will be closed, with minimal exceptions for students unable to return home, or who cannot find housing elsewhere. Students will receive specific instructions from campus leaders regarding when they will be allowed to return to campus to retrieve their belongings from residence halls. Students must follow those instructions. For those students who are unable to depart campus, we will make every effort to accommodate these students. 
USG will be providing guidance to campuses on refunds for housing, dining, and other services. Students should wait for their campus to contact them.
Institutions will remain open, with minimal staff physically on-site, to ensure continuity of certain services.
In the end, we want to ensure that our faculty, staff and students are safe; that we do our part to help stem the spread of the coronavirus in Georgia; and that we fulfill our mission to graduate our students even in the face of these challenging times."

This brings the total of students who have tested positive to three.  There has also been one Georgia Tech staff member who has self-reported a positive test result in the past week.

One of the students who tested positive was last on campus on March 12 and the other was last on campus on March 13.  Both reported their symptoms started several days after leaving campus while on Spring Break.

 

If you test positive for COVID-19, please immediately contact Stamps Health Center at covid19travel@health.gatech.edu or call the Emergency Management Team within the Georgia Tech Police Department at 404-894-2500.

 

When a positive test is reported, the staff at Stamps Health Care Center will reach out to any affected units so that any necessary notifications of potential exposure are communicated and applicable public health guidance is followed. The Task Force will also alert Facilities to determine what, if any, additional cleaning or building closures are required. 

 

If you have not tested positive but are ill or have been exposed to someone who is ill, please follow the guidelines shown in the infographic we distributed last week for reporting your illness. 

 

If you have been ill and want to return to work after exposure or illness, you are asked to follow these CDC and Department of Public Health Guidelines:

If you’ve been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 but you are not showing symptoms of illness, self-quarantine for 14 days. If you do not develop symptoms, you may return to work.
If you are symptomatic of COVID-19 or any general illness (using the infographic above as a guide), CDC guidance requires that the following three conditions are met before you discontinue isolation: 
No fever for 3 days
Improved symptoms
Allowing at least a week to pass since symptoms started. 

In addition, if you have recently traveled to areas where there are ongoing outbreaks of COVID-19 and develop fever with cough and shortness of breath within 14 days of your travel, or if you have had close contact with someone who is suspected to have COVID-19, stay home and call your health care provider or local health department right away. Be sure to call before going to a doctor’s office, emergency room, or urgent care center and tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms.
 
For members of the Georgia Tech community, the best prevention measures for any respiratory virus, including COVID-19 are:
Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Stay home when you are sick.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces

While we understand the concerns and fear around COVID-19, it is extremely important to stay calm and maintain a close eye on your health and any symptoms that may arise. The symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough and shortness of breath. 

 We will provide further updates as more information becomes available."

The 7 universities that have not modified their policies are: Tech (#4), UIUC (#6), UC Davis (#29), UCSB (#34), ASU (#39), UCI (#39), and Colorado School of Mines (#46). 

Not only is Tech being unfair and unaccommodating to students who have limited access to technology or are under exceptional financial stress, but they are disadvantaging *all* students who will  struggle with the transition to online classes and suffer hits to their GPA. By not giving the students the option to switch classes to pass-fail, as 86% of their peer institutions have done, Tech is putting their current students and graduates at a competitive disadvantage against students from other top-ranking institutions and potentially damaging their internship or job prospects, or their chances at graduate school admission."

So many things are changing, there's a lot of uncertainty, and planning for the future seems to get more difficult by the day. There's a lot to be saddened by, and it can be difficult to see past all of it. I've seen a few people post in here concerned that this social distancing and quarantine removes the social events that helped them deal with the stress of GT and life, and I myself have been struggling with that the last few days.

So I made a discord server. For people going through the same thing. The people that miss club meetings and having the motivation to do something **enjoyable** with their day. And to take some time during the day to step away from the stress and the news and home life. On this server, we take that time to do crafting things, like crochet, knit, embroidery, drawing, painting, woodworking, DIY, you name it. And we talk about it. We share our progress and our finished projects, we ask for advice when we run into an issue, we share patterns and have regular events like a Bob Ross paint-along and weekly design challenges and anything else we can come up with.

At least, that's the idea. I just started the server today and invited a couple of friends, so it's still developing. But I'm sharing it here in case anyone wants to join. If anyone is home alone and wants to join a (mostly wholesome) community. If anyone recently started a new hobby and would appreciate direct advice instead of searching through YouTube for another clue. If anyone wants the motivation to continue doing their hobby and wants to share their work with others. If anyone misses people and wants something to look forward to during their week. Then this could be the place.

If you're not interested, no worries. But if you are, please check it out at the link below. Hopefully, it can add a bit of positivity to these ""stay at home"" days.

The AA said that she was compiling a list of all the people that called in with respect to pass/fail grading to pass along to the board.

All of this information is publicly available and I don't encourage witch hunting or doxxing. This post doesn't feel like it violates anyone's reasonable expectation of privacy, however, I personally will be leaving voicemails for each of the board members throughout the day pretty much whenever I decide I want a 2 minute break from work.

Apparently USG claimed they won’t do it because of concerns over grad school applications and the effect on Hope and Zell. 

One of these issues could be solved with opt-in, the other with a little collaboration with the Georgia Finance Commission. I don’t know why these people think it’s okay to jeopardize thousands upon thousands of students’ mental healths and overall stability during a literal pandemic, but their callous attitude is incredibly asinine and insensitive. 

Yeah, I get that professors are doing their best. But they only had 2 weeks to transition in-person classes to something that could function online. Half of them barely know how to edit a Word document. It’s ridiculous to claim that the same grading policies will work when literally everything else about the class has been changed so sloppily. 

Students are sharing computers with siblings and parents who also have to do all their work from home. Many don’t have access to a quiet study environment. Some are also dealing with family deaths or illness. 

And then, on top of that, you tell them they have to work hours upon hours a day to maintain their GPAs for scholarships?? When professors who don’t know what they’re doing are intensifying their classes EVEN MORE, because it’s easier to cheat?? 

You’re not “rising higher,” USG. You’re falling to a low where you exploit a pandemic, exploit students’ mental healths, because you’re a bunch of greedy bitches who aren’t willing to let hard-working students keep Hope and Zell Miller.

Second, when she clarified that the exam is closed book closed note, a student asked, “Won’t this negatively impact the students who follow this rule and now score lower than those who use their notes?” She responded that “no, people won’t use their notes because it is a department policy.” Which is absolute bullshit because there was absolutely no enforcement of this and it only stood to harm students who didn’t use their notes.

Third, instead of accommodating the material to for the lost week, she decided to just cram two weeks of material into a single week and double our assigned homework for the following week. 
 
At this point I’m not even surprised, I’ve given up on my grades for this semester, but it just sucks getting reminded over and over again that some teachers just don’t care about their students.

I am grateful to have a healthy family, have an internship that has gone virtual, yet my mental health is plummeting and I'm ridden with anxiety every hour of the day. Every assignment has become too daunting to complete and I don't have the motivation or will to do them until the last minute. Am I just being lazy? Partly, yes. But partly, no.... I feel debilitated completely. It's like they told us that we would be given two weeks of ""spring break"" yet here we are cramming material in as if we are full time students not existing in the time of an international emergency.

Next week I have three tests, three homeworks, a research paper deadline (I don't know WHAT I'm doing frankly), and I have no idea how I'm supposed to study to get all of this done. I can't even wake up before 11 anymore. I was poorly disciplined at tech -- but now, all those consequences are exacerbated.

I'm sorry I'm just ranting and crying at my circumstances, circumstances I am lucky to have. My question is, who can we contact to make this semester pass/fail? How many people's emails can we bombard? What can we sign? Is there any hope in there being a change? Is this too late?"

&gt;  
&gt;Earlier this month, student government presidents from across the University System of Georgia (USG) sent a [letter](https://sga.gatech.edu/sac-letter-pass-fail) advocating for reconsideration of optional pass/fail policy.  
&gt;  
&gt;This past Thursday, seven of us student government presidents had a meeting with USG Leadership to express once again how we feel that an opt-in policy is in the best interest of students for a myriad of reasons.  
&gt;  
&gt;At this time, I have no indication that this policy will change. I, along with other student leaders, feel disappointed. We will continue advocating for students and doing all we can to ensure student voices are heard in this conversation.  
&gt;  
&gt;These times are more than difficult, and although this update is not good news, we wanted to send this. Please do not hesitate to [contact us](mailto:covid19@sga.gatech.edu) if you have any questions or want to express your thoughts or concerns.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Fellow students,

In these  tumultuous times, we are seeing amazing efforts among students to  provide resources and support for one another. While we currently face  unprecedented challenges, we would like to take the time  to provide information about changes in campus services and student  fees in the future. As we are looking forward to the next academic year  and hopefully resume normal on-campus operations, we’d like to share  with you information about fee changes with regards  to the construction of the new Campus Center.

As previous  announcements have stated, the current Student Center will be closing on  May 31, 2020 for approximately two years. Phase 1 of the campus center  project is nearing completion and is scheduled  to open in June 2020. Some functions of the old building will be  covered by a partial opening of the new building, where pavilions and  exhibition hall will be converted for this transition phase. These  essential services include among others the Post Office,  some dining services (including Chick-Fil-A and Panda Express),  Burdell’s and event services. The new Campus Center, scheduled to open  in Fall 2022, combines the completed new building and renewed old  student center building and will be offering again the  full spectrum of existing services plus additional offers.

Throughout this  process, student representatives have advocated the need for expansion  and have been involved in the planning and decision process, starting  with SGA resolutions in 2009 and the creation  of the Student Center Expansion Committee in 2012. With the need for  student-related contributions to the funding of the expansion, a student  referendum in 2016 supported the implementation of a new fee to realize  this project. However, students supporting  this project have made it a priority to ensure that the fee is only  being placed on students who have the capability to access the new  infrastructure.

With the new  building moving into partial operations, the funding of the construction  through the established public-private partnership will come into  effect as ‘Campus Center Facility Fee’ charged to all  students with an amount of $85 per semester. This fee, based on  decisions made by the administration and student leaders and approved by  the USG Board of Regents one and a half years ago, covers 50% of the  total project costs, while the remaining costs are  covered by the Institute and Auxiliary Services at 25% each.

The fee will be  charged over the next 30 years and will distribute the costs onto the  generations of Yellow Jackets that will enjoy the building during their  time on campus, starting with us. The funding  approach for the Campus Center follows that of the Campus Recreation  Center. Each student is charged a semesterly debt fee, similar to the  Recreation Fee charged for the CRC.

For additional  information about the transition process and the student center  functionalities, please read the letter of the Student Center Expansion  Committee below:

[https://sga.gatech.edu/scec-letter](https://sga.gatech.edu/scec-letter)

If you have any  further questions regarding this fee or the fee’s in general, please  feel free to contact the student members of the Mandatory Student Fee  Advisory Committee (MSFAC) under [ sga-msfac@lists.gatech.edu](mailto:sga-msfac@lists.gatech.edu).

EDIT:

A reminder that this is what we can access:

#### The Exhibition Hall (Phase I)

* 12,000 ft2 ballroom, divisible into five smaller spaces
* 11 meeting spaces with full conference and teleconference A/V capabilities
* Expanded pre-function space
* Convenience of housing Catering Services in the same building

The exhibition hall will be part  of Phase I of construction, which is expected to last from May 2019  until Summer 2020. During Phase II of construction (Summer 2020 - late  2022), this building will serve as temporary space for critical Student  Center functions like the food hall and Post Office.

#### The Pavilions (Phase I)

* An expanded Paper &amp; Clay 
* New office space for Georgia Tech Health Initiatives
* The Center for Assessment, Referral, and Eduction (CARE)
* A standalone cafe with indoor and outdoor seating
* An outdoor fireplace lounge

The pavilions will be part of Phase I of construction, which is expected to last from May 2019 until Summer 2020. During Phase II of construction (Summer 2020 - late 2022), these  buildings will serve as temporary space for critical Student Center  functions like the Student Center and Student Engagement administrative  offices.

I don't usually hear of students being able to discuss family issues and academic performance with professors outside of death, disease, or an accident of some sort....but not things like abuse. ://

Lots of people are talking about how great it is to be reconnecting with their families, and as wonderful as that is, I think hearing those things can be frustrating for people who aren't having that experience. If you're feeling a bit bitter and wishing you weren't at home because campus is the one place where you can get away for an extended period of time, your feelings are valid and I hope you're not beating yourself up for feeling the way you are.

I don't really know what else to say. ""I'm sorry you're dealing with this right now"" doesn't change anything, but ""I'm sorry you're dealing with this right now"" is all I have. Wishing you at least a bit of peace as the semester wraps up &lt;3"

I'd imagine it'd be similar to John Krasinski's 'Some Good News' series, but related specifically to Tech students. While general good news about Georgia Tech as a whole could be covered, I'd imagine it would focus more on the smaller stories of student success that take place over the summer. It'd be a chance for students to share their victories, no matter how minor they felt their wins were. I figure with 25,000 students, there's probably a whole lot of impressive feats and cheerfulness out there that's going under the radar.

People could put forth a shout-out for their friend's achievements or submit their own stories to be told along with others in a ~five minute video uploaded once a week. Do you think it's something you'd enjoy seeing, especially if all the stories were provided by and about our community? If not, what do you think would make it more engaging or enjoyable?

The last few days have been a bit of a whirlwind. We we having to take on Michigan on two three fronts (Carolinas, Florida, and the West Coast), Texas in the Georgia/Tennessee area, and Team Chaos scattered everywhere. Most of these teams were seeing us as a threat and came after us, and it put us in quite a bind. But yesterday was a big day that puts us right back in the swing of things! Michigan is out of Florida, almost out of the Carolinas, and we maintain a significant presence on the west coast that takes a lot of attention away from Michigan.

We do still have Texas and Chaos lurking around, which means today is a good deal to try to deal with that. We have creating a friendly partnership with Stanford called ""Bees and Trees"" that means we should see a lot of dead Stanford players wanting to play for us while we hold the Stanford territory.

With only 5 days left, Michigan is the favorite to win right now just due to the number of players they have. But, several other teams are still in it, including us. We are currently in 3rd place with 16 territories. Let's see what we can manage today and pray to RNGesus that things go our way! See below for info on how to play!

Basically you sign up, and we'll pair you up with 3 other students to virtually meet up for lunch over Zoom. Ideally we'd like to provide more social interaction for people stuck at home as well as an opportunity to meet new people with different interests. If you'd like to meet other students, likely from different majors and different schools, feel free to fill out the form below.

Kendo is a Japanese martial art derived from samurai sword techniques, called kenjutsu. The primary purpose of kendo is to strike your opponent with your sword in a swift, precise manner. However, kendo is not limited to physical strikes.

Kendo translates directly to ""the way of the sword."" Kendo is a way of life. Kendo is a philosophy. When one practices kendo, one refines the self.

I can promise you two things if you decide to join:

1.) Kendo isn't lame. You will build explosive strength, improve cardiovascular fitness, and develop your hamstrings, biceps, shoulders, tris, and chest. You will gain personal confidence and grow as a person.

2.) Kendo will heal your mind and toughen you up for whatever life throws at you. I am speaking from personal experience here.

If you are interested, please contact me. I will give you more information on my vision for the club.

I am a full professor at Georgia Tech and an Associate Dean, and I sit in on multiple meetings a week around planning the re-opening of the campus. I am increasingly concerned that it is not safe for students to return to campus next month. Hospitals in Georgia are under pressure and the Governor is taking an unscientific position and actively opposing the reasonable science-driven restrictions recommended by the Mayor of Atlanta. Cases are spiking. No one I know in the administration believes that we will complete the term in person, but it is entirely possible that the Board of Regents/USG will forbid us to close even as health conditions deteriorate. And sending students home, when we finally do it, will make them into vectors of infection for their traveling cohorts, families, and communities. Other Atlanta colleges are choosing to go remote, as are the Atlanta area public schools in multiple districts. My advice to students is to take advantage of the 20% of courses that will be delivered remotely, and to press the faculty listed as giving ""hybrid"" courses to allow remote participation."

I'm a humanities professor at Tech. In case you are interested, I'll share my experience trying to schedule classes for Fall 2020.

A few weeks ago, we were asked to rank our choices for the instructional mode of our classes (in-person, various types of hybrid that are all apparently actually the same, or online -- but online is only for people with medical issues). Beacuse I was told that in-person was the preferred default, I listed that as my top choice for my classes. (I'm new and eager to please!)

Currently, my classes are listed as hybrid. In that scenario, I was thinking of doing regular outdoor meetups for my students to chat about what they've been reading/learning together, and to give them some structured socio-intellectual time to make friends and feel like part of a community. (Is that what you all want? It's what I was thinking I might want as a student).

But NOW, I have learned that my classes might actually be in-person rather than hybrid (unclear when I'll know this?) if they can find a room for this. Although we were told that in-person classes would be the default, it now seems like hybrid has become the de facto default. So I am a bit worried about being in the minority of faculty to teach in-person. Will students even want to take an in-person class? I have no idea. It's pretty stressful for me to not know what form my classes will take next month, and to worry about whether students will even want to take an in-person class if that's what I am assigned to teach. (I did buy my own air purifier to bring to campus in case I teach in-person!)

I am also curious about what the students want. Do you all want in-person classes? Do you want online classes? What do you want a ""hybrid"" class to look like?

When I thought my classes were hybrid, I was planning to have pretty regular meetups. But it seems like some of my colleagues -- especially those who are parents of children who will be doing at-home learning -- are planning to have very few in-person meetups for their hybrid classes, perhaps making the entire concept a bit of a farce. (Are students okay with that? I don't know.)

I just thought I would share this perspective in case any of you are wondering about the professors' end. I am also interested to learn more about what students actually want/need/expect from us in the Fall."

So i checked my schedule and all of my lectures are online, but every recitation/studio is “partially at distance”, which means that 50-90% of recitation will he online. So what is truly bullshit, is that they want us to come to campus for 25% of recitations, which are already just a fraction of a course, since lectures are fully at distance. How the fuck is this shit allowed, the claim that usg thinks that fully online cannot provide good quality of education, that coming to campus is necessary is horse shit. Because literally we are only coming to campus for at most 10-15% of a class. Fuck USG, fuck georgia tech, money stealing fucking whores."

These are your USG Board of Regents. Some basic facts:

* The Board of Regents is composed of 19 members, five of whom are appointed from the state-at-large, and one from each of the state’s 14 congressional districts.
   * The number is projected to be the same for the next decade because we are unlikely to gain or lose any congressional seats after the 2020 census
   * Although they oversee all 26 USG institutions, at least eight of them are UGA alumni and only at least two are Georgia Tech alumni
   * Five (27.78%) are women
   * Two African-Americans\^, Two Hispanic White, One Asian. Georgia is 60% white, but BoR is 83.33% white (both non-Hispanic and Hispanic)
   * Only ONE of them have any experience in higher education prior to being appointed \*(Regent Hames was a public school teacher and a current Headmaster of a private school; Regent Perez was an adjunct professor for 10 years)
* The governor appoints members of the Board to a seven-year term and regents **may be reappointed to subsequent terms** by a sitting governor.
   * At least two of them are serving their third governor.
   * TEN of them will still serve on New Year's Day 2025
   * There is no student, faculty, or staff input in the entire process, apart from the confirmation by the State Legislature, which is elected by all of us in our role as ordinary citizens.
   * The UC System, for example, has one [Voting Student Regent](https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/about/members-and-advisors/student-regent.html)
* Regents donate their time and expertise to serve the state through their governance of the University System of Georgia – **the position is a voluntary one without financial remuneration**.
* Upon a recommendation from the **Executive and Compensation Committee**, the Board of Regents shall consider any situation in which a Regent has not fulfilled his or her duty as set forth in Board Bylaws, Board Policy, and applicable law and take appropriate action as the board deems necessary to include removal of the Board member.
   * The Executive and Compensation Committee of the Board shall consist of the Chair of the Board, the Vice Chair of the Board, and the Chancellor (ex officio and nonvoting) and include at least four but not more than six members of the Board who are appointed by the Board Chair. The Board Chair shall serve as Chair of the Executive and Compensation Committee, and the Chancellor or his/her designee shall serve as the Committee’s secretary.
   * **Not even the Governor or the State Legislature can remove any of the Regents. Only USG BoR can do that to themselves. T**his makes sense from a standpoint of academic independence, ie. in a change of administration, the Governor can't fire all the Regents and replace them with his trusted aides. But it also means change happens extremely slowly

More [info](https://www.usg.edu/regents/) here. Now you know the facts, the most important part is to start putting direct pressure.

1. The State Legislature is having an election this fall. They approve any new appointments to BoR. There is absolutely no excuse not to vote.
2. The number of valid signatures required for a recall election of Governor Brian Kemp is equal to at least 15 percent of the number of electors who were registered and qualified to vote in the preceding election for that office, ie. 1,035,000 signatures. At least one-fifteenth of the signatures, ie. 69,000 signatures must come from residents in each of the congressional districts in Georgia.

We’re a month out from the beginning of the semester and the spread of covid isn’t slowing down. I’ve been on campus multiple times within the past month and every time I’ve seen a group of 5-10 people socializing without masks or maintaining some sort of separation. I personally don’t have health insurance or the familial support to stay off campus so the fact that others aren’t taking this seriously is infuriating and scary.

Following the announcement of fall course modes this week, we understand you might be getting questions from students that you aren’t sure how to answer. Students are seeking details about individual courses, including flexibility and expectations around attendance, plans for assessments and final exams, and what to expect from the instructional format. We are reaching out with additional guidance to assist you as you communicate with your students about course expectations, and as you get ready for the start of the semester.   

**Requests for All-Remote Participation in Hybrid Courses**

Many students are seeking an all-remote option for Georgia Tech courses designated as hybrid (limited in-person). In order to provide additional clarity, here are some guidelines:    

* Hybrid courses are expected to have meaningful in-person experiences that are integral to the learning outcomes.  
* If you are teaching any course designated as hybrid, you should clearly communicate the course attendance policy and the expectation for in-person meetings in the syllabus. Within these expectations, be prepared to meet needs of students who may be ill, feel ill, or need to isolate so that they can comply with public health best practices while keeping up academically.  
* Students who (a) have received an accommodation approval from the Georgia Tech Office of Disability Services (ODS); and (b) international students who are unable to return to the United States at the start of the semester may request an all-remote option for a hybrid course. We acknowledge that an all-remote format may not best achieve the stated learning outcome for your particular courses, so please use your discretion whether to grant these requests or not. If you are unable to grant a student’s request, please encourage them to work with their advisor and ODS (for students needing an accommodation) to identify other pathways that meet their degree requirements.  
* There may be exceptional cases where a student may have an otherwise unforeseen situation or argument for remote access. We ask that you listen and consider it if the solution meets educational goals and objectives, and is fair, equitable, and feasible. Faculty members should consider requests for all remote access on a case-by-case basis only.  

In general, please respond promptly, reassuringly, and compassionately to students who have these requests. Share Institute and school resources that they may need.  

**Classroom Assignments**
Classroom capacities and assignments are currently being determined. Classroom setups (furniture, A/V, etc.) are being tested by building managers using seat maps from Capital Planning and Space Management. Classrooms are being assessed to ensure physical distancing can be maintained consistently. Classroom seats are being marked to show which ones may be used and labeled to facilitate assigned seating. Classroom assignments will largely be in Banner by August 1. Please recognize there may be necessary changes before the first day of classes.   

**Assessments and Final Exams**
In all delivery modes, faculty will accept papers, projects, tests, homework, and other assignments only in electronic form unless the assignment is a physical artifact. Reading days and final assessments will be administered in a format consistent with the course delivery mode. We do anticipate that most finals will be administered remotely, with a few course-specific exceptions. If the final for your course must be delivered in person, communicate that requirement to students early in the term to allow students ample time to make post-Thanksgiving plans accordingly.  

**Hybrid Courses – Preparing for the First Week**
Faculty may consider, but are not required, to hold the first week of hybrid courses in a remote format. This could allow time for you to test technology and equipment in your assigned classroom during the early class sessions that are typically more focused on course setup and housekeeping items such as reviewing the course syllabus and expectations. This first week could also allow you to communicate with students as they are adjusting their schedules and as class rosters may change.  

[goes on to talk about syllabus development]

**Moving Forward**
We know these last few weeks ahead of the semester will be stressful as final preparations are made. Thank you for your willingness to be as flexible and understanding as possible with your students as they make decisions in these unusual circumstances. These are indeed uncertain and difficult times for all in the Georgia Tech community. It is important that we keep open lines of communication and to redouble our efforts to exhibit patience, understanding, and empathy across the community.

huttru,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/huttru/open_letter_to_the_gt_community/,Open Letter to the GT Community,72,20,2020-07-20 14:09:17,"For those of us who live, work, and study at Georgia Tech, today’s announcement greatly influences our expectations for the fall semester. The time remaining before it begins is limited, and many deadlines, like housing, have already passed. Students and faculty have provided their opinions on the fall plan at a steady rate for several months. Based on their respective responses, both USG and the Institute have at least seen their messages. The faculty’s petition that denounced anything resembling a return to normal as unnecessarily risky was eloquent, thorough, and nuanced. It’s unlikely that I, or any other student, can achieve a similar level of clarity, let alone credibility, in my message. Nonetheless, I feel compelled to write because it is immoral to let this moment pass without calling attention to the fact that something is very wrong. 

This pandemic and its impacts are unprecedented--at Tech, in the United States, and in the world. The amount of misinformation that it has generated is equally unprecedented. Thus, it is crucial to examine the facts that do, or should, influence the administration’s decision. First, the United States leads the world by number of cases, and the Georgia Department of Public Health’s website shows the number of cases in the state to have risen ever since the hard lockdown was lifted. I am not an epidemiologist, nor have I taken statistics, but the trend of the graph looks both unfavorable and concerning to this amateur.

Rather than responding in a concerted fashion, authorities’ actions have been disjointed because of political infighting. Let’s ignore the White House and focus on matters that are more directly related to the university--the situation in Atlanta. The governor and the mayor have been locked in conflict over the mayor’s ability to emplace and enforce local mask mandates. The governor has explicitly banned them, despite masks’ proven efficacy in reducing the disease’s spread. Meanwhile, the mayor has returned the city to Phase One of reopening and requisitioned additional medical supplies from the governor of New York. The city does not sound like it is prepared to accept thousands of returning students from across the nation and the world at this time, though we are more likely to pose a contagion risk to them than they are to us. What could be more foolhardy than clustering thousands of people from vastly different places and allowing them to mix without requiring face masks during every potential interaction?

Some people must be on campus. Their classes, work, or research can only be conducted while they are physically at Tech. People with mental health problems or difficult home lives need the opportunity to be back in a safe environment. Some people must not be on campus. If they are on campus, they risk the lives and health of them and their loved ones. The needs of both groups must be addressed. The remainder of people, the majority that includes me, fall into neither camp. Either option has advantages and disadvantages for us. Let it be clear that we are willing to make sacrifices to pass through this time of trial. I will sacrifice my comfort to protect others’ health if I am on campus. I will endure the challenge posed by online instruction if I am utilizing remote learning. I would go so far as to propose that it is worth losing a small amount of quality of instruction and a large amount of ease to avoid the preventable illnesses and possible deaths of healthy students and faculty which will inevitably result from in-person instruction during a pandemic. This isn’t about me. The fewer people that are on campus, the safer the situation is for those who must be.

A time of great struggle and suffering demands sacrifice from all of us. At Georgia Tech, the largest impacts will fall on those of us who are in the classroom every day--the students, faculty, and staff. I am disappointed in the administration for its seeming hesitance to properly assuage our concerns and provide information in a timely fashion. At the same time, I cannot sufficiently express my admiration for our professors. They have gone above and beyond in every respect, providing both leadership and quality instruction while undoubtedly having to navigate personal difficulties simultaneously. I think I can speak for all of the student body when I say that you have our abounding gratitude. Your willingness to adapt and listen to us is what has brought success to the remote instruction in the spring and summer. Keep doing what you do. I’d appreciate it if the administration of both the Institute and the University System of Georgia would follow your example and stop hearing, stop “Moving Forward,” and actually *listen* to us for once.

hulfzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/hulfzn/this_deadline_meant_nothing_to_me/,This deadline meant nothing to me,68,23,2020-07-20 06:41:50,"75% of the classes I was originally registered to take in the fall have been listed as hybrid, meaning at certain points throughout the semester, I will be required to go in, putting my health at risk, ""for meaningful in-person experiences"" whatever the fuck that means. If I've interpreted the school correctly.

I think I read somewhere that professors have a lot of flexibility on what exactly that HYBR attribute entails (I'm not sure if that was ever correct information at one time, much less correct information now), but even so, I can't imagine going through the entire semester without meeting *and* still being a hybrid - as opposed to asynchronous - course. Which also makes me wonder if attendance at these meaningful in-person experiences will have grades attached to them, and because there are so few of them, how heavily they will affect my grade in this already stressful environment. Because best case scenario, I somehow manage to avoid catching COVID (which we all know how laughable that is) and am healthy and on paper, technically, have nothing preventing me from attending and putting myself at risk. Except for common sense...? And everything else is that at one point in the semester, I will have suffered at the hands of this virus.

Maybe it means that the professor puts us into groups for the end-of-the-semester project and meets with only a few groups at a time. Maybe it means we meet once the entire semester and that's it. Or maybe it means we'll meet once a week. Maybe it means we only come in for exams. In any case, I have no clue. The deadline of July 20 did absolutely nothing for 75% of my semester. It may as well have stayed as ""partially at a distance."" And at this point, I think I am just too tired of this lack of clarity and continuing instability to properly feel fear. Trust me, it's still there, in the deep recesses of my mind. But the white noise of helplessness is drowning most of it out, so... Thank you? Or maybe it's that the fear has become so strong, it's spawned the sensation of feeling powerless and hopelessness. Or maybe that was already the preexisting mental conditions I have. In any case, when I'd summarized the ""new"" information provided to me by this July 20 deadline, I just blankly stared and then quietly double-checked that I hadn't messed something up.

Writing this, I realized, 'Instead of complaining and whining, do what you can to solve your own damn problem and email your professors.' And I probably will after I finish writing this and make myself some coffee, and after I've released all of this slightly angry, slightly disappointed, slightly afraid, mostly unsurprised ""Well, what did you expect from Georgia Tech?"" energy."

It has now developed an international, notorious reputation for taking pro-profit, science-hostile policies that put students, faculty, and staff into confusion, frustration, financial loss, and danger.

Unless any chamber of the State Legislature flips this year and the governor is soundly defeated in 2022 (or that he resigns before that) I will make sure that everybody I know shall avoid USG at all costs, and that any in-state voter should use their power to advocate for more institutional independence or recalling those at the top. I also foresee a large drop of out-of-state applications because prospective students would rather go to a lower ""ranked"" school that they feel safe and happy. To USG, you guys asked for it and I don't feel sorry about y'all. Georgia Tech will become a cautionary tale, and if the situation goes wrong, a textbook example of what NOT to do for public health, organization management and higher education.

This will undoubtedly destroy whatever reputation Georgia Tech has, but we should never ever sacrifice ourselves for overlords that don't give a damn about our well-being. I commend SGA, most faculty, and even some adminn staff for doing this delicate balancing act; y'all should never be out in this position. I hope that you can find a more fulfilling role on another non-usg school in the near future."

-75/older are just 7% of US population but 59% of Covid-19 deaths.

-54/younger 70% of US population but 8% of Covid-19 deaths.

-Covid-19 Deaths don't register a percentage on the grid until ages 15-24, and even then at just 0.2%. Kids K-college undergrad are in no significant danger of dying of Covid-19. 

-Median age of Covid-19 death right now in America is around 78, which is the average U.S. life expectancy. 

-Keep in mind these are all coded as death WITH not FROM Covid. So this doesn't account for co-morbidity whatsoever. Which means someone with heart disease that tested positive for Covid-19 could be counted, someone that died in a motor-vehicle accident and was positive for Covid-19 could be counted, etc.

[This Twitter thread explains what the Charity Bowl is in a bit more detail](https://twitter.com/edsbs/status/1292824817234857984?s=20), but the premise is that you donate in the name of your school, preferably in an amount that represents a score of a famous game where you beat your rival (For example, I donated 28.27). The school with the most donated money wins!    


The donations benefit an Atlanta based cause, the New American Pathways program, which helps immigrants resettle in Georgia, so we have some home turf to defend.  


Georgia Tech finished second to Michigan last year, but thanks to some generous Tech fans, we have a real shot to win it this year. If you're in the spot where you can, please consider donating in Georgia Tech's name!

Honestly this applies to everyone from freshman to those graduating (that’s me in December). 

These are all about me and opinionated, I feel like some resonate w it tho so I’m just putting this out there for sentimentality or smt

comment the biggest way u changed (so far since the start of college) below

1) told myself I would never drink alc LMFAO, I started drinking at 18 in college sort of because of wanting to be doing the same stuff as my friends and also out of curiosity. What I found was that alcohol is a very cheap and affordable way to have fun, but is best consumed in the presence of trusted individuals and is best w a small group of the real homies.

2) used to be a morning person in hs, college turned me into a crackhead night owl for 1-2nd years. Now I’m in the good place tho where I sleep at 12-3am depending on the day. 

3) in high school I was so motivated to just overindulge in extracurriculars but now I know what I really love, what to prioritize in my life, and that life is about following ur passions but also keeping ur responsibilities in line

4) taught me how to ask for help from peers. Hs was pretty cake for me (no flex, just how it was ig) but some classes on college bitch slapped me across the fucking face. However I went to office hours one day in freshman year and it honestly changed my life. The TA was so helpful and knowledgeable and as a peer, was able to better relate to what I was thinking and made the topic make way more sense. Since then I go to offic hours with confidence and it’s lit. Respect to the TAs, especially my 1554 TA, he kept it real and got donuts for us too, fucking legend. 

5) I became super emotionally aware/mature because u go thru a lot in college. Breakups, death of a friend, bomb a test, argument w a friend, wild stuff. I also learned that relationships don’t mean too much in college, we are between 17-23 on average here and like u might have dated from anywhere to 3 months to 3 years, but don’t be pressured to stay in a relationship that isn’t conducive to ur life as a person and student also. I know people in relationships who are like stable at best and keep it for the sake of being in a relationship, but someone who doesn’t get u or u need to compromise yourself for should be dropped. I found that college is where I found out how to be more expressive because my Chinese household wasn’t a place I could even speak my mind. If ur dating or friends w someone who caps ur individuality or has gotten one too many chances, cancel them because u can do better.

6) used to be a tea person and I now I drink black coffee w nothing in it and it tastes like nothing

7) I got involved w random stuff I never would have done in hs like clubs i didn’t even think seemed cool or made friends w people that gave of that wack vibe but I realized that I’m equally wack and it’s lit. 

8) I’m now a fiend at catan, I dominate that bitch like I did ur mom last night, jkjkjk

9) never thought I would code in college, now imma cs major who’s had two google internships and one for apple xD

10) learned to not two flying fucks about another persons negative AND unconstructive criticism of me. This means people who randomly hate or are toxic for the sake of it, I love being constructively criticized because it shows me what I can do better, but people who inherently don’t like me i could care less about. I’m also way more confident, a highlight would be when I walked into a sweethut (not midtown’s), did the middle portion of the chika dance, bowed, and walked off

Overall, be crazy, full send, don’t hinder urself because others are trying to box u, college is about learning yourself, having fun, but being responsible and goal oriented as well. The mix of those things is probably the most conducive to having a good time here."

There used to be a social life on campus, and there were always good ways to blow off steam. None of this is true currently.

This semester has taken the fun out of engineering and I'm struggling to find the motivation to even watch lectures. I cant stand watching lectures that are lower quality than a 2007 youtube video streamed through AOL. Its frustrating, it doesnt spark a joy of learning and everything feels like busywork and homework.

My solution (after this semester) is to quit! I'm taking next semester off and I might stay on break until covid is overwith all together. I'm currently applying to internships, coops and professional jobs to make up the time. GT doesnt require you to get your whole degree at once, so I figure while covid has made school suck ass, I'll go do something else. I dont want to pay full tuition for a lesser understanding of the subject.

I know I could saddle-up and power through these hard times, but fuck that.

A professional job/internship builds your resume, helps you pay for more school and (for me) its a lot of fun.

This isn't really new news, but it was surprising that the place I early voted in the general election isn't gonna be available for the Senate runoff, so I'm planning on voting by mail instead. Don't see Tech McCamish Pav on this list or if there was a post like this anywhere yet on the GT subreddit.

Not a Tech kid anymore, but wanted other busy Tech kids to know ahead of time and plan accordingly if they wanna vote in-person, mail in a ballot, or go to one of the 6 places open, in case the place they expected wasn't open. IDK how voting will be like on election day, but I don't really wanna stand in line for hours in the middle of a pandemic personally on busy election day.

Disclaimer: Not trying to be explicitly partisan. Just stating the fact that there's less early voting places open for a runoff seat compared to the general election. Take that as you will.

Freshman here. I started over the summer and got all As which was ok. I didn't feel bad but I was ready for fall since the summer made me realize that I learn best in-person, not online. I'm a BME major with a ID minor (just switched). I was going to do French as a minor but the intro class quickly made me realize it was not for me.

 Fall has been such a depressive amount of pain and tears that I'm just struggling to think, breathe, or relax right now in winter break. I don't know how you guys do it. I struggled through all of Chem 1211K and got a D. I failed French 1001(it really hurts and I regret not withdrawing) and my GPA is severely hurting to the point where I got an email of academic warning. The thing I'm most afraid of is losing Zell when they check at 30 credit hours. I was working a part-time job in the beginning of the semester working 30+ a week just to pay for housing, dining, etc. Now, I'm just looking for an on-campus job that's less demanding and nothing has worked.

From financial &amp; family issues to my GPA, I really feel like I'm spiralling from being a salutatorian to just really sucking and I literally just got here. I really wanna be here and I really need this degree as I'll be the first in my family to get a bachelor's degree but it's been such a struggle in just this semester. I just needed a place to talk because I literally cannot stop crying."

We have gotten a ton of reviews and are almost at 500 on the site overall! And so many of you have emailed us with encouraging words and super helpful feedback, from UI bugs to feature requests. We read everything and will be taking it all into account as we work hard to make updates over the next few months! And we've also had the pleasure of sending out Amazon gift cards to the few lucky winners.

And another pretty cool announcement - we just got accepted into Create-X Startup Launch for Summer 2021!

Thank you all again - we want Canary to be valuable to the GT community and schools beyond, and we couldn't do it without you. We will continuously be working to improve the platform and help our fellow jackets avoid bad internships and find the good ones!

I am taking this moment to turn my life around and to admit my mistakes in order to rectify them before God and all others. I have been on a long binge to harm GT, and it stops here. Here goes:

1. I drove a car into Nave dining (I am sorry. This one might have actually GT a little. IDK)
2. I systematically campaigned, voted for, and aided anti-GT politicians. Brian Kemp, you are welcome for the governorship!
3. Since 2014, I have been on a relentless campaign to slowly weaken GT's football prospects including telling Paul Johnson the Option could still work in 2017.
4. I contributed large sums in lobbying for the creation of engineering programs at other Universities in Georgia and ran attack ads opposing the creation of new degrees at GT that might lure new talent.
5. I convinced GT that grade inflation was a myth and students would love harder classes with harsher grades.
6. I ghost-wrote the AJC story accusing GTRI of misuse of government funds.
7. I served as James Maloney's character reference on his job application.
8. I arranged for a series of gifts for mental health to be rerouted for bizarre statues near the student center
9. I fudged DM Smith's inspection report to keep it open.
10. In a long-run plan, I spent years maneuvering the right people in positions to create an easily hacked database with student materials.
11. Through a series of bold moves too complex to explain, I had the Auntie Anne's Man taken away from GT.
12. I worked to undermine important institutions at GT such as the Farmer's Market, Engineer's Bookstore, and Under the Couch.
13. I stepped in at a Board of Regents meeting demanding that pass/fail not be implemented in Spring. And I worked tirelessly after to force in-person components to classes.
14. I invited Pompeo to speak at Georgia Tech very recently.
15. I negotiated the contract with Sodexo and forced Taco Bell out the door.
16. I told Geoff Collins that 404 the culture was a great slogan.
17. I made sure the elimination of converse was a condition of the contract with Adidas.
18. I sold drugs to homeless people under the bridge that collapsed resulting in major traffic delays for students. Even worse, I defeated multiple MARTA expansion initiatives. 

I want to acknowledge that this is a non-exhaustive list, and that I don't deserve your forgiveness, but I hope eventually, the student body of GT can forgive me for this campaign of terror. I promise it ends now."

You can find links to a short application and upcoming info session below.**

Hey everyone! SMILE stands for Spreading Messages In Love &amp; Encouragement and is one of Tech’s newest student organizations. In a campus environment that can sometimes lack positivity and feel disconnected, SMILE strives to plan initiatives and events that bring the community together through various means of positivity spreading. You may have come across our Hearts for Campus, Positivity Pumpkins, Quarantine Care Packages, or Among Us-themed Finals Encouragement ([https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/k8spso/among\_us\_fans\_stand\_up\_finals\_are\_sus/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/k8spso/among_us_fans_stand_up_finals_are_sus/)) projects last semester!

SMILE’s mission is arguably more relevant this semester than ever, and we are hoping to recruit a new group of enthusiastic members to help spread joy to the GT community. **This Thursday at 6pm EST, we will be holding an info session on BlueJeans where you can learn more about SMILE, our future projects, and ask any questions you may have**. No worries if you can't make it - a recording of the info session will also be linked in our membership application! You can RSVP to the info session and find the link here: [https://forms.gle/zZ4KGrpUVCQrG7Dz9](https://forms.gle/zZ4KGrpUVCQrG7Dz9) 

Each prospective member will be asked to fill out **a short membership application that can be found at this link:** [**https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_8GEJ5CaZvLFF8Wx**](https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8GEJ5CaZvLFF8Wx)**.** Applications will be looked at on a rolling basis, and the process is intended to be super casual – we just want to get to know you better and make sure you have a baseline understanding of SMILE before joining! While there will be opportunities to meet in person, the majority of meetings and most socials will be conducted in an online format, so **living on campus this semester is NOT a requirement to join!**

Regardless of whether you’re still interested in getting involved with SMILE, we hope that you have a great, safe start to the semester!"

Please get in touch with the UsG and remind them we are human beings.

Edit 2: The general argument from the rest of USG is that GaTech shouldn’t have its own special health insurance policy that the other institutions don’t have. 

Edit 2.1: GaTech has *always* had its own plan. 

Edit 3: USG siphons off funds from GaTech to prop up other failing institutions within the university system of Georgia through internal fiscal “reallocations.” Some of your tuition is paying for students at other schools.

Edit 4: I understand that graduate students purchase the usg plan more than undergraduates do, but please see the bigger picture: this means that any student who needs to purchase health insurance through USG is going to have to pay 33% more. Not everyone comes to this school with health coverage through their parents and to claim this doesn’t affect undergraduates screams ignorance and privilege."

Checking the class groupchat, I found out I was wrong. I spoke with my classmates, we all shared our grievences and wondered what to do. Couple hours passed, and now there's an open letter on our piazza addressing the Professor and the TAs about harsh grading rubrics, with nearly 30 people chiming in and still growing. The professor is now reviewing grading policies and reassessing the assignment. All because we simply communicated with eachother.

I was overjoyed, but all I can think of is all the bad grades i've tanked in the past that I thought were a bit unfair just because ""the rubric said so"" and didn't communicate. It honestly changed my entire mood yesterday and gave me some hope for the class going forward. If you think a grading scheme is unfair, talk to your classmates people. Go beyond a regrade if it gets to that, **we all need every break we can while we're having to take classes through a screen.**

**Where can I find more information about the proposed** **increases?**

Currently, the Georgia Tech SHIP is external to the USG SHIP provided to all institutions, specifically negotiated through the advocacy of Graduate Students and the support of GT administration for the campus to reduce costs and increase services. Although this plan has been approved by the USG for many years, the USG is proposing to dissolve the independent Georgia Tech SHIP and consolidate to a single plan available for all institutions in the 2021-2022 year.  The concerns regarding these proposals are wide, but here are some primary points:

* all unified plans **remove Georgia Tech’s included** **dental and vision coverage** and replace it with an optional USG dental plan that costs $360 per year
* all proposed options increase Georgia Tech premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket maximums for this **overall** **lower service coverage**.
* worst-case proposals include **increases** **of** **$224** **to the Premium,** **$250** **to Deductible, and $2600** **to** **Out-of-Pocket** **Maximum**

Other repercussions regarding the impacts on the on-campus health centers such as Stamps, DePoe, and Tech Dentistry are possible, but Grad SGA and the Georgia Tech administration have been advocating fervently to the USG stakeholders for Georgia Tech to remain on its own plan. We fear these changes could result in the closure or reduced services at these on-campus providers.The Grad SGA Graduate Student Senate (GSS) passed a resolution on March 2nd in opposition to the proposed SHIP consolidation, which can be seen [here](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com%2Fsites.gatech.edu%2Fdist%2F9%2F988%2Ffiles%2F2021%2F03%2FResolution_Opposition-Proposed-SHIP-Changes.pdf&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cgswift6%40gatech.edu%7C45ca8555340f42e320e708d8df4ccd28%7C482198bbae7b4b258b7a6d7f32faa083%7C0%7C0%7C637504868256496852%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=QMw47Zp%2BR1nMURpxmCNgxBgSZBOrtZsfsub5EzIdVrE%3D&amp;reserved=0), to ensure that the USG understands the magnitude of the impact of changes on Georgia Tech Graduate Students.

The USG is considering a proposal that could **increase** **our** **student health insurance costs by as much as 30% ($660/ year), reduces** **insurance benefits, and take** **the embedded dental and vision coverage** **out of** **the mandatory** **plan.** This is being done at no benefit to Georgia Tech students, but to reduce the insurance costs for students at other institutions within the USG, by combining the Georgia Tech SHIP with the USG SHIP. If implemented, this plan severely threatens the healthcare finances of over 6500 Georgia Tech students and their dependents **f**or the foreseeable future. As your graduate student body president, I have been fiercely advocating against these changes at the university system level. The institute leadership is also advocating on behalf of all Tech students. The proposal is set to be **reviewed by the USG leadership as early** **as the** **week of March 8th.**

**How can you** **make your voices heard?**

1. **Sign this** **formal** [**petition**](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgatech.co1.qualtrics.com%2Fjfe%2Fform%2FSV_9HreIA95MEQoWSa&amp;data=04%7C01%7Clmoran9%40gatech.edu%7C29697bd97626433ad9e808d8df47e921%7C482198bbae7b4b258b7a6d7f32faa083%7C0%7C0%7C637504847266297815%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=8ct%2BcFO%2FglQ2HwcpPLAgAG7Hf12ptFFCTupNeufF13o%3D&amp;reserved=0) **by Sunday March 7th -** directed towards USG Chancellor Wrigley and the Board of Regents\*\*:\*\* This time the USG leadership needs to hear directly from every single one of us who will be affected by these changes. You can do this by signing this formal petition put together on behalf of our graduate student body by Graduate SGA.
2. **Email** **the USG chancellor and call the Board of Regents by tomorrow or first thing Monday, March 8th:** A petition alone may not be enough to convince the USG otherwise. That is why I encourage you to express your concerns directly to the USG Chancellor or any member of the Board of Regents. Here is an [email/call-template](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fd%2F1DmsKebxYpl-Ucgn_h9jraklF-H3g6YQfzcHi_AOfUHE%2Fedit%3Fusp%3Dsharing&amp;data=04%7C01%7Clmoran9%40gatech.edu%7C29697bd97626433ad9e808d8df47e921%7C482198bbae7b4b258b7a6d7f32faa083%7C0%7C0%7C637504847266307771%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=5GrpTTi7OBLfvt0MvsOhiWHRasGj6oPYjgEUZgM16DI%3D&amp;reserved=0) for graduate students and [contact list](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fd%2F1yRm6FvZ-6EWkRKdYsKfyKBCCDxr2Dm3u0CnMOFbQCTA%2Fedit%3Fusp%3Dsharing&amp;data=04%7C01%7Clmoran9%40gatech.edu%7C29697bd97626433ad9e808d8df47e921%7C482198bbae7b4b258b7a6d7f32faa083%7C0%7C0%7C637504847266307771%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=jiHlAdeitpxJ9qBxa5z3zPu3VzApuRQuknRyN0axaQE%3D&amp;reserved=0) to use if you need.

**Where can I find more information about the proposed** **increases?**

Currently, the Georgia Tech SHIP is external to the USG SHIP provided to all institutions, specifically negotiated through the advocacy of Graduate Students and the support of GT administration for the campus to reduce costs and increase services. Although this plan has been approved by the USG for many years, the USG is proposing to dissolve the independent Georgia Tech SHIP and consolidate to a single plan available for all institutions in the 2021-2022 year.

The concerns regarding these proposals are wide, but here are some primary points:

* all unified plans **remove Georgia Tech’s included** **dental and vision coverage** and replace it with an optional USG dental plan that costs $360 per year
* all proposed options increase Georgia Tech premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket maximums for this **overall** **lower service coverage**.  
* worst-case proposals include **increases** **of** **$224** **to the Premium,** **$250** **to Deductible, and $2600** **to** **Out-of-Pocket** **Maximum** 

Other repercussions regarding the impacts on the on-campus health centers such as Stamps, DePoe, and Tech Dentistry are possible, but Grad SGA and the Georgia Tech administration have been advocating fervently to the USG stakeholders for Georgia Tech to remain on its own plan. We fear these changes could result in the closure or reduced services at these on-campus providers. 

The Grad SGA Graduate Student Senate (GSS) passed a resolution on March 2nd in opposition to the proposed SHIP consolidation, which can be seen [here](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com%2Fsites.gatech.edu%2Fdist%2F9%2F988%2Ffiles%2F2021%2F03%2FResolution_Opposition-Proposed-SHIP-Changes.pdf&amp;data=04%7C01%7Clmoran9%40gatech.edu%7C29697bd97626433ad9e808d8df47e921%7C482198bbae7b4b258b7a6d7f32faa083%7C0%7C0%7C637504847266317726%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=jguMt5BHLWekVfTzvSQBIEFHOE94iL8F4RM88LvzsKM%3D&amp;reserved=0), to ensure that the USG understands the magnitude of the impact of changes on Georgia Tech Graduate Students. 

Please know that your access to affordable healthcare and financial well-being are top priorities of ours, so I want to thank you for your time and consideration. 

In Progress and Service, 

Lea Harris

I recently applied to a PhD program at GaTech. I got invited to the virtual recruiting event for my program, and I am stoked. Though, I still haven't received an official admission. However, I just got an email today from UPS that mail is coming for me from the PhD office of the school I applied to. Only thing is that the damn package got delayed and I won't see it for a while. Any thoughts on what it'll be? GaTech is my top top choice so the possibility that it might be an admission letter is driving me crazy. Anybody familiar with the process know what the heck they mail to applicants? Should I temper my expectations?

Many thanks!"

CS 6601 Artificial Intelligence
CS 7641 Machine Learning

Thank you Women's Basketball for rewarding us with a deep tournament run and keeping up with number-1-seeded South Carolina.

Thank you for showing the rest of the NCAA that keeping talent at home and developing them into a formidable force over time can still make for competitive teams and a legacy of excellence that will continue throughout the future.

This year we had a special group of seniors.  Lorela Cubaj, Kierra Fletcher, Jose Alvarado, and Moses Wright: you guys have done great things on the Flats and have anchored a stellar group of upperclassmen that have contributed immensely to both the present success and the future potential of the basketball programs here at Georgia Tech.  Your hard work and dedication to success will leave an indelible impact upon your peers, your coaching staff, and us fans as we eagerly anticipate what awaits us in the years to come.

I know that the COVID mess last year has resulted in you guys earning an extra year of eligibility and a chance to potentially return next year to build on this past year's successes.  If you choose to come back, we will eagerly welcome you back with open arms.  And if you choose to move on, we will watch your careers with pride safe in the knowledge that the blood, sweat, and tears you have invested during your at time at Tech will translate to continued success in your futures.

But no matter what path you may choose to take, we thank you for all that you have done.  Good luck in your future endeavors....

Because the Chancellor presides over all 26 USG schools and directly impacts students and faculty alike, we understand the gravity of this decision. As USG schools continue to rise in rank as the nation's best public universities, the leader of the USG must be an individual who has experience in higher education, and is prepared to address challenges facing USG schools. Echoing the words of our accrediting agency, Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC), we implore the Board of Regents to elect candidates with “appropriate experience and qualification.” 

We are deeply troubled that a politicized search could tarnish the reputations of our respective schools and jeopardize the accreditation of our universities. As students, we worry about potential consequences from a loss of accreditation, such as a decrease in competitiveness relative to near-peer institutions, decreasing federal financial aid, alienating alumni and other potential donors, and the devaluing of a USG degree. We ask that the Board of Regents follows the SACSCOC standards to ensure that USG schools preserve their accreditation.

We appreciate the Board of Regents’ statement about valuing the input from USG faculty, staff, students, and the community, and would like to see actions taken to facilitate student input. As students whose lives center around our attendance at USG institutions, our perspective on this decision would be valuable to the Chancellor search committee. We request that a student representative from a USG school be placed on the Chancellor search committee moving forward. Regarding this year’s appointment, we request the Board of Regents to be transparent in their search process, and would appreciate the list of potential candidates be publicized before one is selected and public listening sessions be incorporated into the selection process. We recognize the challenges involved in the Chancellor search process, and we urge the Board of Regents to conduct a merit-based search without politicization. 

Sincerely,

n3mmga,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/n3mmga/psa_a_review_of_palomasignaturetheory_west_midtown/,PSA: A Review of Paloma/Signature/Theory West Midtown,1,39,2021-05-02 20:13:18,"This is a bit of a rant, but I hope it also serves as a warning for students who are considering off-campus housing near Georgia Tech. I've been staying at Paloma Midtown (formerly known as Theory West, then Signature Midtown) which is located at 800/808 Marietta St. NW. I can say with confidence that this is probably one of my worst experiences with leasing an apartment. Don't be misled by the glowy reviews on their Google Page. They provide incentives to residents to write positive reviews. I've listed some of the problems I've had with Paloma Midtown over the last year, in the hope that new students will be able make better decisions than I did.

Costs and Fees

* Fees get added to your monthly bill throughout the year without your consent
* Not a 12 month lease, but you will be paying 12 full installments
* Extremely high subletting fee: 85% of the monthly rent + $250 application fee for the new resident. 
* They are constantly mischarging people. I've had to call so many times to get the balance corrected and each time, ""the manager is not in ''. It takes at least two or three calls to get a simple mistake fixed.
* It’s actually quite difficult to find a summer sublease (granted it’s a pandemic year) despite what the leasing office will tell you when you first sign. You often will have to settle extremely discounted prices and cover most of the subleasing fees. 
* Overall cost break down from 8.15.20 - 4.30.21 in a standard 4x4 apartment assuming you are subleasing over the summer:: 9\*1200 (regular rent, yes, you pay 9 full months) + 250 (initial application/ background check) + 1020 (85% rent, subletting fee)  + 250 (application fee for your new resident) + \~ 3\* 300 (the amount you would cover for your subleaser if you rent out at 900/month, about the market average from what I can tell) = $13220. This is $1468/month for the 9 months that you will actually live there, significantly higher than the off-campus places in midtown and definitely more expensive than on-campus housing. If you need parking, that’s another 125/month and ,oh wait, electric surcharges happen pretty often too.

Communication

* There is no way to communicate with management besides calling, if they pick up. Front desk usually cannot resolve any issues, and when the manager is in, they never immediately help, always saying they’ll ‘call back’ with no response after. 
* Got rid of the community forum, so now any suggestion to management is weak without community support
* Change management twice in the same year, with no warning, and despite saying there would be no impact, they charge us a random service fee due to the switch to a new service provider, WITH NO WARNING FROM MANAGEMENT

Student Life

* Internet also goes out often and the fix time is slow. Pretty inconvenient for students who have work. Calling management will not resolve, as they close at 7, and every outage is late at night when assignments are due.
* The printer/gym/roof are inaccessible after 7 pm. For those who need to print after 7, you'll need to walk to campus
* Constant ear ringing beep in the lobby of the building that they haven't bothered to fix the entire year
* No sound-proofing for windows that are facing the street. I could not go through a meeting without the incessant noises of trucks and cars
* They advertise themselves as a secure location but I would strongly disagree. Half the time, the doors leading to the main stairwell are broken allowing for those who aren't staying in the apartments to walk in with no resistance.
* Even in the so-called secure bike room, there have been incidents of theft. My roommate had his bike stolen from the room and the apartment provided little support and investigating the crime

This is just the tip of the iceberg. For those who don't want to be a victim of student exploitation, I would strongly recommend against staying at Paloma Midtown till they get their act straight. Don't be misled by their fancy tours and showy attitudes. Once you live here, it's a completely different story.

I recognize that people have probably had legitimately positive experiences here, and I'm not discounting those. I just think that the overwhelming negatives of Paloma(Signature/Theory) Midtown make it one of the worst choices for student residence in Atlanta. If you are considering Paloma Midtown, make sure you thoroughly read through the contract so you don't make the same mistakes so many other students have done.

Feel free to comment any positives or negatives about the place. I think making people aware of predatory companies is crucial to ensuring a positive student life."

Please help, I am freaking out",1,14,2021-05-03 07:56:13,"So, I am on good standing currently. I have a 2.5 GPA and I am a junior. This is only my third semester at tech (I'm a transfer). My first semester, I got all Bs (12 credits). Last semester I got 2 Bs (6 credits), 1 C (3 credits), and 2 Ds (5 credits). 

Last semester was a pretty big blow for me, I had never gotten below a B in college before. I am perfectly fine with getting Cs now, especially due to the fact that I am at tech. But the most worrying thing is that I have none of the classes that I took at my last school to fall back on. 

This semester I took 17 credits... which was very very stupid of me. To add to that, I moved countries, my parents got a divorce, COVID happend, andmy mental health is at a very low point. So, I am now probably looking at 3 Cs (9 credits) and 2 Fs (8 credits). This would give me a semester GPA of 1.06 and an overall GPA of 1.93. I have already emailed my advisor, asking her if I will be dismissed automatically. But I wanted to ask all of you as well. 

So the question is, is there any possibility that I could be dismissed outright? Or would I have to be on probation, before getting dismissed? I dont mind academic warning or probation at all. I am truly only worried about being dismissed, and it is making me panic to the max. I can pick up my act, and bring my GPA up, but I dont know what I would do if I were dismissed."

In a controversial decision and a landmark move by the American Psychological Association, Tech Bro Disorder or TBD has been added to the most recent edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders. TBD is a disorder that affects thousands of people and disproportionately affects the richest one percent of Americans. The diagnosis was so contentious to create because many believed that TBD was actually just another form of TMD or toxic masculinity disorder. Recent research has suggested that the two are distinct disorders. TBD is diagnosed using an 8-part checklist. Individuals must have at least 4 symptoms from the checklist including at least one of the first four symptoms from the list:

1. A compulsive need to work long hours and brag about lack of sleep.

2. A tendency to talk on end about the wonders of cryptocurrency and data science despite rudimentary technical and math training.

3. False belief in ability to create the next big company despite no or near-mediocre coding skills, usually in combination with frequent mention of NDA’s and “the business side.”

4. Recent change in long-term goals and interests, specifically focused on changes in interests related to a dramatic increase in desire to work for a startup or “FAANG.”

5. Inclination to dismiss females and to promote gendered stereotypes around computing and coding, often while dismissing lack of female interest as proof that, “women only go for jerks and never nice guys.”

6. A recent uptick in confidence of code and belief that collaboration is no longer important because “others lack vision.”

7. Random desires to include the words “Blockchain,” “Quantum computing,” “visionary,” “cybersecurity” in a Linkedin job description.

8. Use of the phrase, “It’s like Uber for \[something other than cars\]”.

TBD is considered a part of a new class of disorders called Occupational Identity Disorders. The category includes other disorders such as Finance University Consultant Knowledge Economic Research Scientist Disorder, which includes individuals who define themselves by the belief that their skilled knowledge in their profession them better than others and Journalism Architecture Doctor Education Disorder (JADED), wherein individuals deliberately choose difficult careers with low return because of a belief that they “love what they do.” Recent advances in psychology hope to soon help these individuals too.

If you or a loved one is currently suffering from Tech Bro Syndrome, don’t suffer in silence. Plenty of people with TBD end up living happy, fulfilling lives, and being able to move beyond their diagnoses. If you suspect that you might have TBD, please do not wait. Contact your primary care physician and ask for a prescription for Emily Chang’s book Brotopia or call the TBD hotline where operators are standing by to help walk you through the process of uninstalling the Linux operating system and deleting programming languages you don’t actually know from your resume. 

Help exists. Take it from patient ‘Mark Z.’ who recently began treatment for TBD. “It had gotten bad. One day I was talking about 10xing it and the ‘grind,’ the next I was wearing Patagonia and thinking about running for president and saving the world. I didn’t even know that my startup was hurting those around me and the country I love. Don’t suffer in silence. Get help.”"

My first gripe is the price.

12.50 for lunch but then 17.50 for dinner is kind of absurd. Nothing about dinner justifies a $5 upcharge (40%!!).

The food being served is actually very good, or at least dinner was today.

The drink, not so much. For the volume of students being served @ West there is **one** freestyle machine. And when you got there they were out of every non-diet flavor!! There should be more machines and they should be refilled much more frequently. Unacceptable for an almost $20 meal.

The lines are unbearably long AND slow. If you think about it those are separate issues. It’s hard to control how long the lines are but how fast they move is absolutely a problem. At peak hours (think 6,7,8 pm at West) there was like **one** person slowly making every plate at any given station. Which meant that to get food you had to wait in line for like an hour or something.

Either employ more people that can get orders fulfilled faster (seriously shit moves faster at Panda Express) or make it self serve.

It’s sort of ridiculous that getting and eating one plate can take over an hour.

Lastly, no dessert for dinner? For the amount of money I paid I cannot fathom how there wasn’t dessert upstairs.

Everyone says the food on campus is bad and it doesn’t seem like that perception will change this semester unless things change.

For reference, if anyone cares, lunch is 11.95 and dinner is 14.95 at my old college, and their lines moved faster because self serve. And they always had dessert, ice cream, the works."

Following the football game and labor day weekend, it's quite obvious that we're gonna have covid cases, and we're already seeing an uptick similar to fall of last year. Now, I'm not gonna be that person and say I didn't go to the game, because I did, and I had my fun, but I also wore a mask the entire time, even though I was in the student section.

I'm very, very concerned that we're going to be seeing people this week and possibly next week coming to class with covid, saying that they might have the cold bc they didn't get tested or don't care about it. I've already seen people visibly coughing and sniffing in class since last week and I don't understand why these people are willingly there, and especially without a mask on. I know that since we're in person, it's harder to avoid not going to class for the sake of grades but cmon  these profs have taught in covid before. You can reach out or ask a friend for notes instead of putting a bunch of people at risk. I feel like people forget that not everyone stays on campus, coming in contact with at risk people and old professors for that matter.

I have the vaccine but I still don't want covid. Please, people, let's start owning up to the possibility that you may have covid whether you like it or not, and that it's not okay to put other people at risk. The spread of covid still claims human lives. I unhealthily monitor my grades, but human lives and the damage covid does to the body is more than grades. I don't understand how some of yall here can go about your days knowing all of this and still putting people at risk. Youre adding to the list of reasons why I hate humans smh"

We’re a team of CS students that have gone through the struggle of finding an internship, from trying to find up-to-date salaries on cluttered job sites, to searching through months of Discord or Reddit posts to learn more about the role.

We built intabs to alleviate some of these pains – you can think of this site as an all-in-one “Glassdoor for interns”, with curated reviews, salaries, and timelines from real students and just for interns.

Here are some of the features you’ll be able to use right now:

* Search for company salaries by graduation date and season
* Share reviews of the best (and especially the worst) places to work anonymously
* Prepare for your upcoming interviews by viewing previously asked questions
* Discover when people are getting online assessments, interviews, or offers
* Keep track of the status of your applications with built-in process tracking

We’re working hard to keep our site updated, and we currently have over 400 salaries, 100 job postings, and 300 reviews from current students and past megathreads. If you have any salaries or reviews you’d like to share, we would really appreciate it if you add them as well to help grow the community.

Check out intabs [here](http://intabs.io/)! To anyone looking for an internship in the future we hope that you find this helpful – we're always trying to improve our site, so we would love to hear your thoughts and feedback below.

Jamie Harris from [Animal Advocacy Careers](https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/) will be giving a short presentation introducing the career opportunities available to improving animal welfare, especially for addressing factory farming. Afterwards, there will be plenty of time for Q&amp;A, e.g., for some quick advice and support on a key uncertainty that you are facing.

In 2020, 9.76 billion land animals slaughtered in the US alone, and [99% of them raised in factory farms](https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/us-factory-farming-estimates) with conditions likely to cause [serious suffering](https://founderspledge.com/stories/animal-welfare-cause-report). Besides being a major source of animal suffering, factory farming also contributes to negative environmental impacts and increased risk of pandemics.

Addressing factory farming doesn't have to mean protesting in the streets. Key talent bottlenecks in the movement to end factory farming lie in science and engineering roles, as well as in computer science, data analytics, social science, business, and advocacy, and more. ([""Career Guide for Ending Factory Farming""](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/mgdep9583Qc6ZBSQo/))

I double checked to make sure this post doesn't break any rules - I'm a regular in r/learnmath and r/calculus. I'm making this post to help Tech students with intro/intermediate courses. This is free - I'm a hobbyist who does this because I enjoy teaching and I do not charge for help.

I'm not an alum myself, but a friend who took her intro math classes at GATech mentioned that it might be a particularly good fit because of its massive class sizes, and because instruction can be rather impersonal. She's told me stories of her multivariable calc office hours, where they would wheel out blackboards to the lawn when groups got too large, and they would have hundreds of students staring in confusion. I think there might be a lot of students who could benefit from some interactive help. 

My friend's experience was with a handful of courses she took here, but I can help with any intro/intermediate math/phys/chem course, and algorithms. The format is a Youtube livestream with a Discord server for questions - we typically get a few volunteers to participate in live discussion while other students ask questions in text chat as we work through a problem set, and this leaves behind a compact recording for later reference. Feel free to check out a past sessions (on youtube) for some York Uni students to get a feel for the style. I typically go online 6-9pm EST on Sat-Thurs evenings for open questions, but when a couple of students are working on the same problem set, I'm happy to schedule a session.

I'm aware that this is a novel idea that might invite skepticism, but I'm absolutely serious about this - if you're curious, why not post a question in the discord? I'll be available for the rest of this evening and I'll try to help. There's obviously no obligation if you don't like it, but if you do, you'll have a handy interactive resource for your classes.

The Hive also isn't taking 3D prints and everything seems really backed up. Is there any way anyone knows to get a 3D print done quickly?"

rbioug,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/rbioug/is_atlanta_really_that_dangerous/,Is Atlanta really that dangerous?,27,133,2021-12-07 20:30:49,"So I am prepping to apply to grad school at Georgia Tech next year but there is one thing that keeps popping up and that is safety and crime. Pretty much every week I see some sort of crime or something in Atlanta. Car theft, car windows smashed, robbery etc 

Is it like that everywhere? Midtown? Is that not where a lot of office buildings are? Even in the north side? Brookhaven? Dunwoody? Sandy Springs?

See, I thought of just living north which apparently is safe and commuting using MARTA train but apparently the train is not safe either? Like there are some shady people on trains too?   


Fellow students, how has your experience been?"

I get that Collins clearly loves hiring former players as coaches, but there's only so many of those candidates that are actually quality coaches (not to mention the fact that if we don't AT LEAST make a bowl game next year, Collins is gone and he knows it). If you're not a huge college football fan then you probably wouldn't know this, but Michigan State ranked 130th out of 130 FBS teams this year in passing yards allowed per game. DEAD LAST. And we just hired their cornerbacks coach as our DBs coach. I hate to say it, and it's nearly impossible to have a worse secondary than we did this year, but we might just have an even worse secondary next year."

I signed up for housing in time so I’m not sure why I would be moved for people who are on the waitlist. Does anyone know a way to fight this?

I got roped into a west coast server (Nidavellir) because my son and his friends were out there, but they aren't playing as much any more. I am looking for an east coast server, hopefully with some GT students/grads that are interested in playing on a regular basis. Or maybe at least someone can let me know a good east coast server (Atlanta area? - don't know if location matters) to join. I guess I will need to start a new character with the region change, so if someone needs a specialization in their company, I am willing to level up accordingly. My current character in Nidavellir is a level 60 Marauder using primarily Bow/Hatchet. I have also tried Sword/Shield, Great Axe, War Hammer, Fire Staff (teh suck) and Ice Gauntlet.

I'm retired, so it's not like I'm doing anything else at this point. DM me if you want to keep this on the down low, LOL."
