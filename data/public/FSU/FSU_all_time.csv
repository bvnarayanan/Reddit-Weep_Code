We live in NY and will be moving to FL. I've tried to do as much research as possible on FSU and like what I see. My daughter is black and while it appears as though the school has a good amount of diversity, including international students, what is the culture as far as that? I've read that FSU is like a ""good 'ol boys"" school"" (don't shoot the messenger pls) and just want to make sure she has a great typical college experience at a school that seems as though it has a lot to offer and I don't have to worry about her. Believe me, I'm aware that racial incidents and sexual crimes happen everywhere. Thank you."

We took our rabbits to Landis tonight. Many people have been doing so, and we've done so in the past. There are dogs around, but we try and stay far enough away and keep our rabbits close. No one we've talk to, before tonight, has had problems. I wasn't particularly worried because all I saw were puppies. 

However, later we saw some young asshole with a dog that was running off his leash, and the dog started to get into a fight with another dog. The owner just ideally chased him and didn't even try to grab his dog until his friend literally yelled at him to grab it. We were on alert, but the dog went off the other way. 

Then, when our friend arrived I stood up to greet him. Next thing I knew that dog was in our area and chasing our rabbit. We all were trying to catch everyone, but they were too fast. Next thing I knew the dog had our rabbit's head in its mouth. The owner tackled him and kept yelling ""drop it"" while I pried the dog's jaw open. Then it took after our other rabbit while I was trying to get our now injured rabbit to safety. 

I'm not angry at the dog. I'm angry at the irresponsible fuck that let's a ill-behaved dog run free. THEN, before I had everyone secure, the motherfucker just ran away. He disappeared. He didn't apologize. He didn't even ask if our rabbit was okay. He just ran. Ran away from his responsibility. This is what pissed me off. I could've forgiven the accident. Dogs will be dogs. But he should've taken more care. 

I have no idea who this kid was. And I doubt I will ever see him again. But I hope someone here knows him or he see this. I hope he knows that he is a cowardly piece of shit. I low-life, pathetic piece of human trash. If my dog did anything at all like that I would be more worried about the other animal then my own ass. So if you, by some miracle, know who I'm talking about, please tell him that he is a piece of shit and should NOT have a dog if he's not willing to be responsible for it. "

A few days ago I found out that a former classmate had been reported missing in Tallahassee and hadn't been seen for about a week. I assumed there would be a post on the FSU/Tallahassee subreddit but there isn't one yet so I figured I would post it.

His name is Edward H. Neuse, he's blonde, average height and build, and has a beard. He is potentially driving a 2000 green Toyota Tacoma Pickup (2 door) displaying FL tag ADJS17. I do not believe there is any more information available about the situation, but if you happen to see anyone matching his description, please call the Tallahassee Police Department.

What a great experience! From the beginning of the day to the end, everything was top-notch. They had plenty of people to help direct you where you were going, and with any possible question. They had SIGNS everywhere to help you find your way. 

I have to contrast that with my experience at UF 10 days ago when there wasn't a single sign ANYWHERE to help with things. (not to dis the UF people -- they were friendly and helpful, no issue with that) But just as an example, at the beginning at UF we were greeted by these large lines of people ""signing in."" (which was done manually, as opposed to the ultra-effecient FSU, which literally checked you in by scanning your event ticket while in the parking garage, taking a grand total of 2 seconds) Anyway, not only were the UF lines long, but there was NO WAY to know which line to get in without asking someone. So mobs of people were trying to find UF people to ask (which took extra time); others just got in the long lines, only to find out that they were in the wrong one. Literally, all it would've take was a pen, a piece of paper, and some scotch tape and I could've solved the whole thing for them. Anyway, I digress about UF.

The FSU sessions were all interesting and helpful. I toured 3 dorms I may be interested in. Not only were the people working the event GREAT, and plentiful, I found the people on campus were just as friendly and helpful. They would literally stop and try to help us find our way, some even tried to look stuff up on their phones when they weren't sure. This is just your average student walking around.

I went to a presentation for the Business School -- terrific! Everyone is so enthusiastic about what FSU has to offer. Also went to the exploratory major presentation. (not sure if I'm going to do business or exploratory)

Anyway, I had high expecations going into this, because I really liked FSU when I went for the brief 2-hour tour last summer. I gotta say they exceeded my expecations with their Preview Day. They are Crazy Good with their student outreach. "

If you see somebody who looks a bit lost walking around campus, it's probably one of them.

As you can see, things took a sour turn for my sweet hat on St. Paddy's Day. From what I have pieced together, apparently my hat fell off as I got into the Uber around 10 PM at Finnegan's Wake. The hat has pretty high sentimental value, and if anyone can help provide information regarding its whereabouts I would greatly appreciate it.

If by the small chance the hat is returned, I will compensate those who helped with a generous reward. This specific hat is LiteFelt and is a Bailey's Briar Safari hat. Looks just like the picture, and on the inside it says it is from Meyer the Hatter.

I know C session is starting soon, which means lots of new faces on campus. I know that during the upcoming semester, you'll probably have some nights where you need a ride. Maybe you drank too much. Maybe your friends bailed on you. Maybe you just need a ride to campus.

No matter what the issue is, you're going to need a ride at some point, and if you decided to use a ridesharing app, I'm here to ask you to **PLEASE USE LYFT**. I know that Uber is the word we all use, and I know that Uber is *super convenient*, but as a driver who drives both Uber and Lyft, I really wish students would use Lyft.

Here's why:

1. Uber takes 35% of the fare from drivers. Lyft takes 25%.
2. Lyft is actually slightly cheaper.
3. Lyft allows tipping your driver in the app.

Even if you never tip a dime to your driver, using Lyft helps your driver by giving them a bigger cut of what they earn. Right now, a lot of drivers are only driving for Uber because it's where the customers are. If students started using Lyft and started telling each other to use Lyft, lots of people would switch. That would mean more drivers, which means lower wait times. I know that you can tap your Uber app and have a car there in 5 minutes or less. Lyft might take a little longer to get there (for now), but if it's all the same to you, it really benefits your driver if the ride is happening on Lyft instead of Uber.

**tl;dr:** Lyft takes less money from drivers than Uber and costs about the same. Please use Lyft."

**Registration-Related Reminders**

* The Drop/Add period for Fall 2017 begins Saturday, August 26 at 12:01AM. 
* Drop/Add ends Thursday, August 31 at 11:59PM. *Students are financially and academically liable for all courses on their schedule once the drop/add period ends.*
* Students who register for their *first* class on or after August 28 will be assessed a $100 late registration fee. If you don't have anything on your schedule yet, make sure you get something on there on Saturday or Sunday to avoid this fee. 
* First day attendance is *mandatory*. If you miss the first meeting of one of your classes, you will be dropped from that class. 
* *Students should not rely on skipping first class meetings as a way to drop a class*. Every now and then a prof forgets to drop a student who missed the first day, and sometimes that same student was relying on skipping as a way to drop the class. The student is often unaware they are still in the class, and ends up being financially and academically liable for it. Don't let this happen to you. If you need to drop a class, just go into the system and drop it (registration holds rarely, if ever, prevent drops). It is always the student's responsibility to ensure that their schedule is correct before the end of the drop/add period. 

**Important Dates for the Fall 2017 Semester**

*View the [academic calendar](http://registrar.fsu.edu/registration_guide/fall/academic_calendar/) for more dates and information*

 * Petition to reinstate a class schedule cancelled for nonpayment of tuition. 
 * Doc students to take and pass prelim exams in order to add/convert dissertation hours for current semester.

As you all know there is a powerful hurricane heading to Florida and I am wondering how this town typically reacts to situations like this. How long is the power down should the hurricane arrive as a Cat 3 or higher? Is there flooding in the city? How quickly does water and other essentials disappear from local markets? Thank you for any help in advance! 

*Edit with useful advice for those people who just came across this thread and want to know what's up without going through all the comments: 

- Expect electricity to be out for days/weeks
- Flooding is largely not an issue
- School is cancelled for the duration of the blackout in the dinning halls
- There will be running water but it will not be drinkable 
- Fill up your car now
- Trees are a hazard
- Buy water and essentials asap. Best case scenario the hurricane doesn't hit and you use the food water in the long run anyway. Worst case scenario you have the essential tools to stay relatively comfortable while this whole thing blows over.
- If the storm is larger than a category 1 leave town if you can.

Most of my friends have either graduated and moved on with their lives or just don't have time for me anymore. I feel so fucked up and alone just having to cope with hearing about Vegas myself. 

I've been really depressed lately and just don't feel like I have anything left to live for. I've been stuck in this town since 2011 trying to get my degree and some asshole had to shoot and paralyze me. I probably won't graduate until 2020 and I currently don’t know if I have the energy to complete school the way I am now. I'm biomedical engineering so it's quite difficult. 

I've tried to make friends in all kinds of ways, but it's never good enough. I never feel good enough or anything anymore. I know people say it all the time but I really do try and be a good person. I care about my friends and the community. I've always done as much community service as I had time for. I'm a good listener and gift giver. 

I smoke and unfortunately can rarely drink since being paralyzed. I like playing video games, board games, listening to music, and watching things with my friends. 

I also like to be outside. I'm getting a canoe soon but will probably need help taking it out. Fishing, going to the dog park with my service dog, and just being active are things I enjoy. I go scuba diving as often as I can and like bringing people with me. 

If you have any free time, even just a message would be really appreciated. Maybe one-day I won't feel so alone all the time."

I'm Eisa, I help run all the esports teams for Blizzard games on campus. We compete in Tespa tournaments, which is the official collegiate esports partner of Blizzard Entertainment. Students from across NA compete for scholarships, merchandise, battle.net credit and more.

We are always looking for new players for each of our teams. We've done reasonably well in each game so far, but are always on the hunt for good players. Here's some info for each.

--------------------------------------

Heroes of the Storm:

&amp;nbsp;

Our HotS team, FSU Crab Legs, has been around for 3 years now. We've competed in each Heroes of the Dorm since, placing top 64 out of around 300 schools each year. Our games have also been streamed live on ESPN.com.

We have 1 Master and 1 Diamond player currently, but we still need players, so anyone is encouraged to tryout. We will hold practices multiple times a week. This spring tournament will have large scholarships up for grabs, and likely participation prizing for everyone that competes.

Here's our team page from last spring: https://heroesofthedorm.com/teams/34

--------------------------------------

Hearthstone:

&amp;nbsp;

Hearthstone also has it's big collegiate tournament during the spring. We've had 4 FSU teams compete last semester, and almost made the national bracket. The tournament is a standard Bo5 competitive format with 3 students on each team. Players with multiple meta decks are encouraged to apply.

--------------------------------------

Overwatch:

&amp;nbsp;

Last semester's TCS OW tourney featured our inaugural FSU Overwatch team. We are looking for anyone with &gt;3000 SR to tryout. We currently have 2 GM players and are looking to make a strong showing for the spring.

--------------------------------------

&amp;nbsp;

More information about each game's spring tournament will be announced within the next month. But we are looking to recruit early in order to be prepared and ready to play.

If you're interested in any team, please shoot me a PM.

**Registration-Related Reminders**

* The Drop/Add period for Spring 2018 begins on Saturday, January 6 at 12:01AM. 
* Drop/Add ends Thursday, January 11 at 11:59PM. *Students are financially and academically liable for all courses on their schedule once the drop/add period ends.*
* Students who register for their *first* class on or after January 8 will be assessed a $100 late registration fee. If you don't have anything on your schedule yet, make sure you get something on there on Saturday or Sunday to avoid this fee. 
* **First day attendance is mandatory**. If you miss the first meeting of one of your classes, you will be dropped from that class. 
* *Students should not rely on skipping first class meetings as a way to drop a class.* Every now and then a prof forgets to drop a student who missed the first day, and sometimes that same student was relying on skipping as a way to drop the class. The student is often unaware they are still in the class, and ends up being financially and academically liable for it. Don't let this happen to you. If you need to drop a class, just go into the system and drop it (registration holds rarely, if ever, prevent drops). It is always the student's responsibility to ensure that their schedule is correct before the end of the drop/add period.

7. Go out on campus and distribute flyers and free swag but make sure you don’t say anything that could in any way be meaningful to anyone.

87j9wv,https://www.reddit.com/r/fsu/comments/87j9wv/my_freshman_experience_and_advice_i_would_give_to/,My Freshman Experience and advice I would give to future Noles.,56,17,2018-03-27 08:24:45,"Hello! I am a freshman at FSU and have been having a great year so far. I just want to help out any incoming freshman how I can by telling them what I did and wish I did throughout this year. Let's start with the life lessons I learned:

Dorms:
https://photos.app.goo.gl/tFI7ltEJgwjgl58n1
That link is from my dorm room. The moral of the story is DO NOT LIVE IN SALLEY HALL. Live off campus before living there. The photos show water damage, mold, cockroach fungus in the corners, and later I will add a photo of the bathroom to show how bad it is. None of the pictures show the 12 cockroaches my roommate and I had to spray and stomp when we were cleaning our room this weekend. At $3000 a semester, you are paying about $800 per month for rent, which is comparable to some of the nicest apartments in the Tallahassee area, such as a 4/4 room at Onyx, the new expensive place in college town. Mind you, the room is extremely small, with just about 250 square feet to be shared by 4 people. The staff is nice, but not always responsive to issues (our sink leaked for a month before we were able to get it fixed, however it was mostly because one request was put in the wrong place and we were not in the room when they came to check). I simply cannot say this place is worth a penny of what I'm spending when I am rooming next year off campus for less than half the cost for rent. To me having an RA isn't quite worth the extra penny (love ya alyssa). Some of the other dorms are nicer however. My girlfriend lives in Jennie Murphree Hall, and it has much more space, but other than location I would say the price is also extreme for what is given. That being said I think it is worth it to spend a year on campus if you can get a nicer dorm, as it creates a college community and keeps you safer and more responsible during year one. 

Meal plan:
Lucky you, meal plans are not mandatory next semester. I would recommend not having one if you are in any need for money. In case you cannot tell by my tone yet, I have had a very bad experience with Sodexo. The company follows horrible business practices and tries to lie and decieve you into giving them money. The mandatory meal plan this semester costs $1799. To add the VIP package (which allows you to exchange a swipe a day at a better location) it tacks an extra $100 to that. The meal plan provides 200 meals. When broken down with flexbucks ignored, it ends up being $9 per meal. You can almost eat Olive garden for that price, and that is every time you swipe; breakfast, lunch, and dinner. With that, the VIP package is only worth $6 at most locations. This means that every time you use the package you payed extra for, you are actually paying more than they are providing you. I end up eating Subway nearly every day as a result of it being the only place on campus where it is worth more, at $9 per swipe which is what it should be. My girlfriend did not have money to pay the plan, and when they moved Suwannee dining hall down to the union, they still required her to pay for it, and she was given the choice to move out or pay 2000 she didn't have. The people were very rude to her throughout the experience and I have nothing but resentment towards Sodexo. The dining hall food is mediocre, and they always put a show on when the parents come for orientation, but the food is horrible the rest of the year. All that said, I hate Sodexo, not the FSU dining workers. A lot of them are extremely nice and talkative people that are enjoyable to be around, but Sodexo themselves just steal your money in my opinion. 


Alright, negative stuff is done. Let's get to some things I wish I did:

Recreational sports - I love being active and doing sports, but with me being a music Major I had to spend all my time on that. I intend on joining a team next semester, maybe swim or soccer! 

Clubs: my girlfriend just joined FSU Teach and the Teachers club and loves the atmosphere and friends she has met in it. I am part of a few groups but I will also be joining some next semester. 


Some things I learned:

FSU reimbursement: it's kind of dangerous I'm saying this, but any school related trip will be helped out by FSU. For example, I completed in a 3 level collegiate competition where I had to travel around the country, and the college helped me and my quartet out monetarily throughout the process. That being said, don't abuse it. The school has limited amounts of money they can give for these things, whether travel, research, or competition fees. So don't expect your meals and car rentals paid for unless you are spending very little on everything else. 

Practice: especially for musicians, but really for everyone. Study or practice and spend as much time on this stuff as you can. You are at school to learn and improve and become a master at what you are studying. Don't mess this up with too many drinks or video games. 

Fun: have it. College happens once, and it's at a great time in life when everyone around you is at their most explorative and social. So have fun and become an adult. Party with friends and be as social as you can, I am an introvert and I have come out of my shell a lot throughout this year. 

Drinking: up to you. I don't drink because I find it doesn't really suit my style of fun, but a lot of people do it and a lot of people love it here at FSU (or any college). Just don't let anyone make you do it, and don't do it just because you think you can't have fun without it. Trust me, around campus there is always something to do that is sober, like visiting the REZ or STUDYING or going to the gym. Have fun whatever way you want, but don't have so much fun you have to drop out. Remember: 4 years of good fun &gt; 1 year of lots of fun and a lifetime without a degree or losing all scholarships and help. 

Your teachers care: they really don't want you to fail, however it isn't high school where they let you get away with laziness. They will give you a C or a D if you are late on assignments or do bad on a quiz they didn't plan on curving. The mentality amongst all the teachers I have had is that they will help those who come to them and who want to improve. To the others they have to help themselves. 

TAs are awesome: when you walk into class and your teacher is 23 instead of 93, don't think that they don't know every single word of the textbook. Their lives since their first day of college has been based in that material. A physics lab tech will have been studying physics since their freshman year, and are typically as smart as the professor (minus experience and doctoral knowledge yadayada). What I am trying to say is that you should treat them as a professor and get their help as if they are your major teacher. 


Tl;Dr fsu is a great place to grow. I have been here one year and I am much more mature and social than I was through high school. It will be a great experience, and more than anything the people here are awesome. Be wary of the companies that run the campus, but other than that have fun and do what you can to become the best person you can be. Find success and explore. And go Noles!"

Time flies when you’re having fun. I’m going to get back to studying for finals, but guys I really love you. #GoNoles

This contest allows high school seniors to declare their college choice online at www.declarationdays.com. By doing so, they also enter to win a scholarship of up to $5,000. Additionally, the three universities that receive the most declarations overall win hats and/or t-shirts for all the students that declared for their school. 

The contest ends in about a week, on May 1, and FSU is currently in *second* place. So we have a good shot at winning at least something. But to be perfectly honest, I really want us to be #1 overall at the end of this thing. We're only about 250 declarations behind Oklahoma, and we have a real shot at winning (especially since we enroll about 1,000 more freshmen than OU). For those of you that have been around FSU long enough, you'll know how nice a victory over OU will feel. 

To sweeten the pot for FSU students to enter, our office is also giving away prizes on a weekly basis. I have some hats fro ToW and gift cards from various local business partners, and I'm giving a few away each week to students who post about their declaration on Twitter and/or Instagram using both #NowANole and #DeclarationDays. I'm also going to pick one incoming FSU student at random from all our entries to win a move-in prize pack that includes an FSU-branded chair, hammock, laundry bin, blanket, and backpack as well as a $100 Bed Bath &amp; Beyond gift card. 

If you're an incoming freshmen, we encourage you to enter the contest. At the least, you stand a very good chance of winning a free hat/t-shirt as long as our #2 overall position holds. And you might win one of our other prizes or a scholarship from ToW. "

So quick story, if any of you were there this morning you may have witnessed this. 

It was early this morning right as orientation started and they started forming a line for everyone to get their FSU card. So we’re standing there as the line is enormous and they get to the first few people to take pictures. This kid walks up to get his picture taken with this student employee. 

He has a few bags in his hands so he decides to rest them down on the floor to take his picture. THEN WE HEARD IT. 
At the top of their lungs in the most terrifying demonic fresh out the gates of hell voice started screaming at this poor kid to “PICK YOUR BAG UP. PICK IT UP. PICK IT UP NOW. I SAID PICK IT UP.” 

It was like a “Full Metal Jacket” Marine Corps boot camp scene. 

Poor kid gets flustered and puts his bag down again. Guess what happens; more screaming. 

At this point everyone that could hear it from a 7 mile radius all looked at each other at the same time for a collective “WTF” 

It definitely was NOT a “warm” welcome start to all of us. We were kind of surprised no one said anything to that employee. But I guess everyone has a bad day... However, I don’t see how anyone with that temperament tasked with something so simple could function in a work environment... it was quite terrifying. 

Every other person was more than amazing though! The entire team of people who put in the hard work were excellent! 

But that drill instructor....that’s a YIKES from me.

My girlfriend was driving to FSU campus on W. Tennessee St. Yesterday, 08/28/18 approximately around noon. She was at the stop light, not moving and was hit by a negligent driver right there at the turn into campus opposite the Tennessee St. McDonalds. 


Now, my gf's car didn't get messed up too awful bad, but it did just about knock the front end off the other car. Now, my gf is a smart girl, but none of them smarts got to do with cars so unfortunately all I have to go off of is:


 it was a small, 4 door, standard red, car with white bumper sticker. 


The driver was a petite-esque white male. 


Shortly after the accident he made an illegal u-turn and fled the scene, which made it too dangerous for my gf to follow him, and he did so without giving his info to my gf. My gf called TPD and filed a police report after she gave up trying to find him. TPD has officially filed the incident as a hit and run. 


I had my gf also contact the FSU police force, and for some reason they did indicate that someone called in regarding the matter, but, he did not leave his information, and they said they are not authorized to release the number he called from, when she asked TPD they said they could not get the info from the FSU Police. 


As it stands now, my gf may need to report this against her own insurance, and I don't know about y'all but I don't think this dude should get away with this. 


I'm not looking to hurt this guy or anything, I just want his contact info and insurance information. I feel that everyone oughta pay their dues and if anyone's crazy Tallahassee insurance rates gotta go up it oughta be his and not hers. 



I don't much know what to expect but my fellow redditors seem to be mostly good people, so, if y'all got any info, please post it or pm me, I ain't looking to start nothing, I just want my gf to stop feeling guilty for letting herself become a victim on her first day back to school. "

**Registration-Related Reminders**

* The Drop/Add period for Fall 2018 begins Saturday, August 25 at 12:01AM. 
* Drop/Add ends Thursday, August 30 at 11:59PM. *Students are financially and academically liable for all courses on their schedule once the drop/add period ends.*
* Students who register for their *first* class on or after August 27 will be assessed a $100 late registration fee. If you don't have anything on your schedule yet, make sure you get something on there on Saturday or Sunday to avoid this fee. 
* First day attendance is *mandatory*. If you miss the first meeting of one of your classes, you will be dropped from that class. 
* *Students should not rely on skipping first class meetings as a way to drop a class.* Every now and then a prof forgets to drop a student who missed the first day, and sometimes that same student was relying on skipping as a way to drop the class. The student is often unaware they are still in the class, and ends up being financially and academically liable for it. Don't let this happen to you. If you need to drop a class, just go into the system and drop it (registration holds rarely, if ever, prevent drops). It is always the student's responsibility to ensure that their schedule is correct before the end of the drop/add period.

 * Petition to reinstate a class schedule cancelled for nonpayment of tuition.

I've talked to case management, and they basically said there was nothing they could do besides sending out an email to my professors and hoping that then they would be more lenient...My professor wasn't, he's really nice though and he thinks allowing me to get 50% is the nicest thing he can do while still being fair to the other students.  


Has anyone experienced this before? Is there anything else I can do?"

I'm a CS major and I took a course called (**COP 3223) Introduction to Programming with the C Language** that I got an A in, but am now wondering if this course would even transfer. I looked up the CS course directory for FSU and they have a course with the course code (**CGS 3223)  Introduction to Programming with the C Language.** So the names are identical but the Course Codes differ. From what I can tell the curriculum looks identical, as an Introduction to a Language course can only teach so much. How can I assure that this credit will transfer over, should I save the Syllabus just in case? Who should I reach out to who might be able to help me with this?

This is not a political post; it is simply a warning to understand what you are signing before you actually sign it. Don't just ""be polite"" etc. Remember that these petitions have power and if enough people unwittingly sign a petition they don't actually agree with there is a legitimate chance that that petition could be on the FL ballot in 2020 with legitimate legal and legislative implications for our state.

If you feel pressured into signing something some good excuses are that you are not registered to vote or you are registered to vote out of state. Or of course you could just say ""I'm sorry but I cannot sign this at this time."" You have that right. 

Again this is not a political post. I  don't care what your politics are. And if you agree with a particular initiative, by all means sign the petition!

I plan on working while in college, but I wouldn’t have the money up front to pay for a meal plan by the payment date without taking on student loans (unsubsidized are what I would have to take out), which I’m desperately trying to avoid.

I am a freshmen, on track to graduate in 3 years, as of now (we'll see how that goes lol). I'm a neuroscience major, so if you're in a psychology or biology related major, it'd be cool to get to relate over what scientific interests we may share. If not, it'd be great to get exposed to different career interests and experience too!! Personality wise, I would say I'm extremely open and accepting, and some people may find that off putting. There aren't many conversation topics I'll shy away from either, so prepare for that too. I would overall consider myself extroverted, but I do get quiet and take on more of an observing role sometimes. I'm quite talkative, so it's not hard for me to carry the conversation if need be.

I'm really into a lot of musicals (my favorites are Heathers, Falsettos, and Starship), disney park trivia, poetry, painting (specifically love using watercolors. I'm not that skilled, but it's still really enjoyable.), Dungeons and Dragons (I've yet to play any campaigns, but would have 4 sets of dice if the day ever comes), and listening to indie/alternative music. Some of my favorite bands would be Cavetown, The Front Bottoms, alt-J, McCafferty, and Cake.

So here is a megathread to ask all your admissions questions, so as not to clutter up the rest of the subreddit. 

Here's a quick rundown of the most common questions we're getting:

* What is the November 1 deadline for? 
 * November 1 is actually the deadline for a lot of stuff. Not only is it the priority deadline for Freshmen applying for Summer/Fall 2020, it's also the final deadline for Transfer and Graduate applications for Spring 2020 (although many Grad programs have earlier deadlines). 

* What is required by the November 1 deadline?
 * For Freshmen: The application itself, the application fee (unless waived), the Self-reported Student Academic Record (SSAR), and your self-reported SAT/ACT scores. 
 * For Transfers/Grads: The application itself, the application fee (unless waived), and official transcripts from all the colleges you have previously attended. Freshmen/Sophomore level transfers must additionally submit official high school transcripts and SAT/ACT score reports. 

* How do I submit my SSAR and self-reported SAT/ACT scores? 
 * Once your application to FSU has been submitted, you'll gain access to the Application Status Check tool, which contains a checklist of required materials. On this page, you will be able to submit your 32-character SSAR ID and also self-report your SAT/ACT scores. Please note that if you apply via Common App or the Coalition application, it'll be one business day before you're granted access to this page. You'll receive an email that morning with instructions on how to set up your account and log in.

* Can I still meet the deadline if I submit my Common / Coalition application on November 1? 
 * It takes one business day for us to receive applications from The Common App and the Coalition application systems. As such, if you apply on November 1, you likely won't be able to log in to our website to submit your SSAR ID and SAT/ACT scores until Monday, November 4th. This won't be a problem. We're aware of the delay between systems, and we won't penalize students for it. Just be sure to submit your SSAR ID and self-report your SAT/ACT as soon as possible once you're granted access to our website. We'll allow a few days' grace period to get those items submitted.

There are huge privacy concerns with FSU's decision to use HonorLock for exam proctoring and I will be including snippets of HonorLock's privacy policy to reiterate these concerns.
___

# Webcam Requirements
&gt; You’ll start by scanning the room with your webcam to ensure that no one else is present and that you’re not using any external resources, and then we’ll have you verify your identity by taking a picture of both yourself and your photo ID with your webcam. 

I, as well as many other students, did not sign up to take online courses this semester. I already operate on a very tight budget since I pay for school, housing, and food (in addition to other things like internet, cell phone, gas, etc) out of pocket. Requiring us to go buy a webcam (and yes I'm aware they're ""cheap"") when some of us live paycheck to paycheck is incredibly unfair. If FSU is mandating that physical campus students now buy additional items more than halfway into the semester, will they be giving us the money to do so or provide them to us? Doubtful.

# Storing recordings of students that use the software, as well as keeping copies of our government and/or school ID
&gt; After your test, one of our exam proctors may review the exam session to look for any potential violations, and the recording will also be sent to your instructor along with any notes from our proctors.

Personally, the idea of a third-party having full Video and Audio recordings of me feel like a huge invasion of my privacy. Further, the idea that **they can potentially keep these video/audio recordings of you (as well as photo copies of your government ID) for an indefinite period of time** is extremely concerning.

# Storing non-related Information (e.g. your browser history, cookies, and running processes)
&gt; Like most websites today, our web servers keep log files that record data each time a device accesses those servers. The log files contain data about the nature of such access, including the device’s IP address, user agent string (e.g., operating system and browser type/version), and referral URL (i.e., the external source by which you arrived at our Website, or the pages you’ve clicked on while on our Website). We may use these log files for purposes such asassisting in monitoring and troubleshooting errors and incidents, analyzing web traffic, or optimizing the user experience. 

This is self-explanatory, **they are tracking everything you do while you run their software**, a proprietary and closed-source browser extension that REQUIRES google chrome.

# Distributing aggregated data among Third-Parties/Business Partners (aka selling your information to other companies)
&gt; In an ongoing effort to better understand our Visitors and the Website, we might analyze your information in aggregate form to carry out, maintain, manage, and improve operations in connection with the Website. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. We may share this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents, and business partners. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services and the Website to current and prospective business partners and to otherthird parties for other lawful purposes. 

**They're going to sell whatever data they can to third-parties**. This is standard language used by websites like Facebook.

# Encryption of Data
&gt; We use secure encrypted protocols to save and view all student assets. Honorlock’s certified proctors and your institution’s faculty are able to review test session videos until they are deleted based on the school’s retention policy. 

**Nowhere on their site, or in the browser extension is an actual description of what type of ""encryption"" is being used** in the transmission of any data that occurs on your computer while their browser extension is running. This is a HUGE red flag in terms of their potential capability to distribute decryption methods/keys to third-parties.

# Potential Violation of FERPA
According to FSU's [own policies](https://dsst.fsu.edu/newnole/resources/student-privacy-parental-access):

&gt; **Any record that is maintained by an institution and that can personally identify a student or group of students is an educational record**. Since FERPA is technology independent, these records can consist of any number of media, including but not limited to files, documents, tapes, disks, film, microfilm, and microfiche.

I would consider Video recordings of our persons, and our homes (which have incredibly strong privacy laws to begin with) a violation of FERPA.
___

In the end, we shouldn't be forced to have a third-party company invade our privacy, and give up our personal information by installing what is in reality **glorified spyware** on our computers. It's bad enough that we aren't getting what we paid for, don't make us give up our privacy just because it's more convenient for the administration and colleges.

We have a right to privacy according to the University's own policies and I urge the administration to protect and maintain our rights."

Met a lot of friends and had a great time...however it only drove me deeper in the closet.

I remember during first week pledging we were told multiple times that if we were a fag we better walk out the door immediately. Generally speaking the brotherhood, and many others from what I've heard, had an unwritten rule that gays were not allowed. There were a few exceptions but that's just how things were.

This is obviously not everyone's first choice when graduating, however,FSU mades it even worse by not calling out the students names.

"" Graduates’ names will not be individually announced during the virtual ceremony due to time constraints. Names will briefly appear at the end of the virtual ceremony and can be found in the digital commencement program that will be posted online at [**commencement.fsu.edu**](http://commencement.fsu.edu/) prior to the ceremony. ""

I think it's ridiculous that they're claiming time constraints as the reason for not stating the names. They could easily do separate virtual commencements like they would in person and say everyones names. I know that this doesn't matter to some people, so they could even have people request whether or not they want their name to be called. There are no constraints from preventing FSU from saying the names, they just don't want to do that and I wish they'd at least own up to it."

Just read this article: ""UM Students Want a Refund Over COVID-19 Closures, Putative Class Action Filed"" - https://www.law.com/dailybusinessreview/2020/04/10/um-students-want-a-refund-over-covid-19-closures-putative-class-action-filed/

""according to her lawsuit, which claims Dixon and hundreds of other students paid higher fees for an “in-person, hands-on curriculum,” but what they got was online classes that will diminish the value of the degree “for the rest of plaintiff’s life.”

The complaint claims students are missing out on face-to-face interactions with professors and peers, access to facilities, participation in student unions and government, sports and other activities, and opportunities to network and develop social independence. Dixon alleges class members chose UM out of “hundreds, if not thousands” of other schools for precisely those benefits.

“Although defendant is still offering some level of academic instruction via online classes, plaintiff and members of the proposed class have been and will be deprived of the benefits of on-campus learning,” the complaint said.

UM did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The lawsuit, filed in the District of South Carolina, accuses UM of breach of contract and unjust enrichment. It seeks damages and a refund for the 2020 spring semester’s fees and costs, including room and board, parking fees and extracurricular fees.""

A lot of people at FSU are in a similar situation. They are paying full tuition and fees for the on-campus and in-person experience. While online education may makeup some of that, students are not getting what they fully paid for.

So, do any of you think FSU students would consider suing the school for tuition refunds?"

My highschool counselor explained to me that these grades were to be taken off of my record, therefore I should take it as they never happened.

Please note, ALL of this is tentative and subject to change, so take it with a grain of salt. I'll try to answer any questions/comments.

* Bronze, silver, gold phases of reopening
* Currently on phase zero
* If things turn out poorly, Leach could fully close
* Bronze would mean outdoor classes, zoom classes
* Silver would mean instructors in the studio doing livestream classes
* Gold is back to normal – full capacity, regular Group Ex classes, no restrictions
   * Gold is unlikely to occur any time soon
* Current plan is to open FMC on August 10, Leach on august 15
* Virtual classes are not guaranteed
* “wellness check” on the app – do you have any symptoms, exposure, etc
* MANDATORY masks
* No cardio equipment, 2 benches and 2 squat racks in Leach
* Squares blocked off for stretching, that’s it
* Facility reopening
   * You can come in to work out by reserving a time slot on the rec app
   * 125 people per slot
   * No waiting list – if you don’t show up that spot disappears
   * 1:15min slots
   * If you don’t have a spot, don’t bother waiting in line outside of the Leach, you will not be admitted
   * No guests, you have to be affiliated with FSU, student/staff/etc

One of the requirements of the course is that my employer do a final evaluation through FSU Qualtrics. The company I’m interning with only does internal evaluations, not external. I informed my professor of this and had my manager explain as well. The professor stated it would be fine for me to email my final evaluation once I receive it, but until then the course would be marked as incomplete. The professor assured me that it would be fixed once I email the evaluation.

For context, the course ended July 31, 2020. I received and emailed my final evaluation on August 10, 2020. 

Earlier this week I received and email from Financial Aid stating I was an “unofficial withdrawal” because my courses were marked incomplete and that I may have to pay back my summer aid and also complete an exit interview for my loans. I emailed financial aid and explained the situation and got the automated response. 

I also emailed the professor and got an automated email stating they are out of the office until August 19, 2020. I thought nothing of it because the professor said my grade would be fixed once she returns. No problem. 

Yesterday I decided to check my financial aid. I’m a low income student from a poor family so I’ve ALWAYS gotten the full pell grant amount. 

Before yesterday my pell grant amount was around $3,400. It is now $790. I’m not sure what to do because the professor is out of town, I have to wait a week for financial aid to respond, and I won’t have enough refund money to cover my living and tuition expenses for the Fall semester. 

Was this because the course for summer was marked incomplete? Has anyone else experience this? What should I do?"

Look, I hate Honorlock as much as the next student. It’s invasive, the eye tracking stuff is creepy, and I don’t want to be paranoid that any random movement will be flagged. But at the expense of sounding like a narc, I have a clear and simple message:

Shut up.

I’m tired of seeing posts asking for how to circumvent Honorlock’s proctoring tools. Do these posts affect me directly? No. But if this garbage continues, and FSU decides that Honorlock is too weak after the umpteenth pissed off 20 year old decides to screen cast his notes to a TV and cheat through exams, there is a good chance will find a more invasive system, like ProctorU, which has a real life proctor watching you through a webcam at every moment.

Your odds of getting caught are slim. On Reddit, you are blissfully anonymous. But the outcome of being caught is far worse than the D you might have eked out on your Orgo quiz without cheating. Do you want to risk expulsion for the instant gratification of getting a marginally better grade? Do you want to learn? This is not how you learn.

To be clear: I’m still annoyed that FSU is using Honorlock. I wish there were a better system, and I do complain about it. However, the student who complains about Honorlock because it is invasive and spyware is typically not the same person who complains about Honorlock becuase it won’t let him or her bring a crib sheet into a test. Motive matters.

Please stay safe guys. Go noles."

I’m sorry to once again intrude on this subreddit, but I wanted to ask a few questions regarding students’ opinions of FSU:

1) Is there a noticeable lack of diversity (and is there racism) on this campus? I’m an Asian-white student coming from a HS with a student body that’s about 49% white, and I wanted to know if I would experience some type of shock here. 

2) How is this campus for those who are part of a pre-health program? 

3) I stalked this sub and noticed there’s an ongoing problem with crowds and partying during this pandemic. Would you say that the ignorant students on this campus take away from your personal enjoyment of FSU? Would you change schools if you could afford it?

One of my goals for these upcoming four years is to come out of undergrad without taking out any loans. The safest option for my goal as of right now would be to stay home and attend UCF completely debt-free. However, I was accepted into FSU the through CARE program, and I would love the support the CARE has to offer that I wouldn’t receive anywhere else in the state other than FSU as a first-generation student. With going to FSU I would have to get a dorm, a meal plan (debating whether I should get one or not to save some from my financial aid package), I would also need money for personal miscellaneous, anddd I would also have to find a new job since I would have to leave the job i’m currently at in Orlando.

It promotes itself as helpful and cheap but it is a scam! Here's a sample from the email I received:

""The Follett Access program allows you to subscribe to required textbooks at exclusive, lower than market prices from the FSU Bookstore. You can automatically pay for your textbooks through your tuition and fee payments, receive immediate access to the textbooks on the first day of class, and get the best deal possible on your new books.""

There is no chance to subscribe to this service if you want it. Textbook charges are automatically applied to your account and you can not opt out until August 9th. The chance to opt out is intentionally set to open at a later date so you'll get busy and forget about it. The hope is that you will forget about these charges that the bookstore tacked onto your class fees and end up paying for books you may not need/can find cheaper elsewhere. Do NOT let them steal from you! Fall semester fees will be due at latest September 3rd. Make sure you opt out before September 3rd so that you aren't stuck paying extra fees."

I have been pretty sick the last couple of days causing me to miss some class already. I just got my test results back today and unfortunately tested positive. Am I supposed to individually email each of my professors to let them know or is there some other process I need to go through? Thank you.

I dropped out last year because no one was willing to accommodate my medical issues. I went in with a FAFSA loan and bright futures. I did a medical withdrawal and was told I wouldn’t be charged for tuition because it’s medical. 

I sent in all my forms and completed everything online. When I tried to check the status, everything was gone. I called (and good lord is it difficult to get anyone who knows anything on the phone, even after being rerouted several times) and said I couldn’t see my application online anymore, but they said it was fine.

I’ve been getting emails from my loan company saying that I need to pay them back, but I never cashed the checks FSU sent me. I tried to contact them. Again, near impossible. I was told the checks were cancelled so it was fine. 

Turns out I still owe all that money to the loan company. FSU has no idea where the money is, even though, as confirmed by the loan company, it was given to them, not directly to me. 

Now I’m getting bills for the refunded tuition that I was told I wouldn’t have to pay because I had medical reasons to withdraw. They lost my withdrawal application. 

So I’m thousands in debt according to my credit, I owe FSU another few thousand, and they have no idea where the money that I owe but never took out is, nor the application with all the medical information that I guess I’ll have to go through and recollect. 

I’m so pissed. I hardly even fucking went to this school and I’m thousands in debt."

given the amount of our peers who seemingly don’t give a shit about their health or the health of their classmates, professors, or the tallahassee community at large, my anxiety is the worst it’s been the entire pandemic. most of the students in my classes are maskless. kids are coming to class hacking up their lungs at an increasing rate. i can hear coughing all night in the dorms. and with the inevitable mass rise in covid cases coming our way next week after the football game, i just don’t feel safe on campus. 

yes, i’m vaccinated. yes, i wear my mask. but i haven’t been able to focus in class. i’ve been losing sleep. i’ve lost weight because i’m too scared to go to the dining hall. maybe i just have bad anxiety, but until this is behind us, i can’t see myself feeling safe and productive on campus. 

do i have any choices at all here? of my five classes, only one is online and one other is a flex class. that leaves me with three (massive) in person classes where everyone is sick and nobody wears a mask. 

it seems the state/the university has limited our ability to keep ourselves safe. i’m just at a loss for what to do."

I'm not the complaining type and I really don't want to come off as whiny or entitled but there was no food out aside from the cereal bar, the occasional burger being grilled up and one food station serving food that wasn't even on the menu online (and also not the best quality...to put it lightly). I get that it's not the most popular place on campus and I understand wrapping up early for that reason (though two hours early is a bit ridiculous), but if there's next to nothing to eat, maybe warn students about that before we waste our money/meal swipe? I could have gone to any overpriced restaurant in this town and gotten a better deal.

I'm not sure if this is the result of the new food supplier or the pandemic causing hiring/supply issues or what, but man I'm disappointed and wanted to know if anyone else has had this experience recently or if this is just a stroke of bad luck. I really hope it's the latter because I used to love coming here :("
