Just a heads up, there's a Christian Cult that is mobilizing on campus. To be upfront, they believe in a Korean Jesus and that any other Christian who doesn't belong to their church is basically misguided by Satan and destined to hell.

Of course they don't tell you any of this until you're part of their church, however, they have a very methodical way of brainwashing people over a period of 7 - 8 months, which as crazy as it sounds, makes their doctrines convincing. Once you are a part of their church, it's basically mandatory that you dedicate your entire life to their cause.

They particularly meet at the MU during noon and approach people by first asking if they can conduct a quick health survey. They then move the conversation to religion and ask if you'd be interested in attending a Biblical class.

They go by ""Light ministry"" or ""Zion"".

If you want to read more about their beliefs,  this blog covers a great deal.

YESSSS THIS IS THE GAME THREAD I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO MAKE

Wednesday marks the second day of March Madness and the first NCAA tournament game ever for our UC Davis Aggies! UCD is playing in one of four play-in games in Dayton, OH to determine who makes it into the Round of 64. We play the North Carolina Central Eagles, winner of the MEAC championship and tournament. Don’t let the titles make this seem too daunting; the MEAC is one of the weakest conferences in DI and NC Central, while a big fish in a small pond, isn’t ranked much differently from UC Irvine.

UCD must play at least at the level they brought against the Anteaters, including lock-down defense to keep NC Central’s offense of-balance and passable shooting numbers to survive a probably low-scoring game. The Ags’ hopes likely rest on Brynton Lemar and Chima Moneke getting to the rim and free throw line in the last few minutes of the game, as they have in the last few contests.

All in all, this is one of the most doable matchups UCD could have received in March Madness and while the Ags are slight underdogs, they do have serious momentum and all the tools necessary to overcome a decent opponent.

**Time:** Wednesday, March 15 at 3:30 PM

**Location:** UD Arena, Dayton, OH

**Bracket Implications:** Winner faces #1 Kansas on Friday.

**Predictions:** I’ve seen NC Central by 3 or 4. A couple of pundits have the Ags pulling an upset.

**Following the game:** See comments."

#Battle of the Bands Info

Complicated and big enough that it warrants its own section. The rules go something like:

1. Each band plays a song in turn, with the condition that a) nobody else has played it before and b) it isn't their fight song.

2. A band loses and exits the Battle when they play their fight song.

3. UC Davis always wins.

There are certain other traditions -- for example, Stanford (when they're not suspended) will play a 45-minute song that everybody joins in, and Humboldt State plays ""Louie Louie"" with breaks for literally everybody to get a solo. Generally towards the end of the night the crowd migrates from band to band as a mobile dance party.

Yeah I want to get a nice job and make a lot of money but I don't have any motivation. I have no intention in going to grad school so grades don't matter but I still keep them up. I guess this quarter, you can call me hitting 'rock bottom'. Winter was a really tough quarter with upper core classes, and I got substandard grades that took a hit to my GPA. I am kind of in a depressed state now. I am honestly so tired, like I don't know why, but I just feel like I need a break and just step away. I told myself, once I reached Davis I would relax a bit but seeing everyone else being competitive and like getting these internships and maintaining all these leadership positions just gets to me.

This is not a pity post, but rather a post to show that it's normal to struggle.    
    
It's easy to view a bad grade as a failure.    
The real learning comes when I have had to learn how to overcome a bad grade, or how to use that 'failure' to guide me to something positive.    
    
You can learn so much about yourself by getting a bad grade.    
        
It may feel like the end of the world, and make you feel stupid/useless/not worthy; but bad grades can be so much more than that. Also, depending on your future career your grades really may not matter.

For all of the local bay area transfers and freshman try not to go home this weekend. I was a transfer last year that lived at Primero Grove and was shocked to see the parking lot nearly empty the first weekend and many following the first month or so. The first weekend for many people sets the tone for the rest of your first year. A lot of us come with goals to get out of our comfort zones and meet new people to get out and share new experiences. When the first week passes and you don't meet your BFF or go to the Project X party you saw in the movies, its easiest to try to head back home to well established communities. This is especially true for fellow transfers who likely worked and built most of their relationships outside of community college. 

In order for you to get those experiences you have never been a part of, you gotta do something you have never done before. Put yourself out there! The MU has a ton of booths going on this afternoon for information on clubs, fraternities, and other groups looking for new people to join. Facebook/social media groups exist for new students to get out and meet each other to try and get in the groove of things. Everyone worked super hard to get here so get out and make the most of it!

Also for any **fellow transfer students** I am getting a group together tonight to go on a local pub-crawl to show people around town and meet other new students. It will be super laid back and more of a way to get to know each other instead of simply getting plastered. If you are interested PM me and I can shoot you the details. 
**Freshman** I may host a small group to head to the farmers market tomorrow and then a dager from one of the frats before helping setup a party later that night for the rowing team. If you are interested in coming along and attending any of these events shoot me a PM and I can send you some details. 

TL;DR Try not to go home this weekend and stay on campus as it can help kickstart a great college experience. If you dont know where to start ask around or shoot me a PM. No I am not trying to recruit, just know how much it sucks to stay inside and watch Netflix when you were wish you were out exploring. "

1. All businesses in downtown have stamp cards. Use them regularly! Commit to using them when you go out to get coffee or snacks. Peet's also just got a new rewards system. Dutch Bros is really generous with stamps. Nothing is better during a really stressful finals week than a free coffee.


2. Change up your methods of transportation. If you live on campus or even kind of close, consider walking. Getting around is stressful since it's so damn crowded, but I found it helped to change it up. I biked all my first year, then when I realized how great walking and the bus was, I regretted biking so much because there is something stressful for me personally about the bike traffic. 


3. ASK FOR HELP. No matter what you are struggling with, there is help somewhere. I have noticed that especially younger students get into trouble when they are afraid to ask for help. TAs, Was, career center, counseling, there is so much... cultural resources. Please take advantage of those resources. However, you can't wait until something spirals out of your control. Nip issues in the bud.



I know I will think of more. Share yours! Keep it positive."

7a1orn,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/7a1orn/story_of_dismissal_and_readmission/,Story of dismissal and readmission,45,12,2017-10-31 22:34:58,"In winter 2017 I failed all my classes. I took too many extra curriculars, including a sport that ended up having too much of a time commitment, and I failed all
my classes in winter qtr 2017. I received emails saying I was on academic probation and that I had to appeal my dismissal but I didn't check my email for a few weeks 
(I dony have a habit of checking emails or social media) so I didn't see the appeal for dismissal opportunity. I was dismissed from UC Davis.

To this day I still feel like my dismissal was because of my lack of timely email responses. I am HORRIBLE at communicating with ppl - I barely use fb, I dont use snapchat,
instagram, twitter, or whatever. I was bad at it and I ended up getting dismissed because of it.

The dismissal was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. I was the valedictorian of my graduating high school class, and a super active student, and winter was
the first quarter that I ever failed a class. I ended up getting dismissed the quarter afterwards. I didn't tell my parents because I knew they would want me home and 
work instead of trying to get a second shot at getting readmitted to UC Davis. The only ppl who knew were my gf (who was SUPER INCREDIBLY HELPFUL) and one of my trusted
coding partners (for seans 60: thats right, Im a CS major). No one else knew. 

It was hard grasping the fact that I got dismissed. I cried MAYBE a handful of times in my whole life before I got dismissed, but after I cried more times than I can
count. I had to retake a cpl of difficult classes in summer in order to get readmitted. Earlier today I got an email saying I got readmitted. I got a pass time for
spring registration (I havent had a pass time for over a year- it brought a tear to my eye). So I decided to post this for anyone who got dismissed and needs motivation.

IF YOU GET DISMISSED: Do not freak out. It happens. Don't get the mentality that you're not good enough, that you're stupid, or that school is horrible (I was 
valedictorian in high school and got dismissed). People get dismissed, not because of grades, but because of technicalities like not reading ur email.
Work hard. Keep moving forward. Don't keep locked on the past. My girlfriend gave me a book, ""The Shortness of Life"" by Seneca the Younger, that changed my life. I 
highly recommend that every single person reads it. It motivated me when I had very little to hold onto. Find out whatever/whoever motivates you and 
read/write/do/listen it every single morning. Keep a routine and NEVER break from it. You WILL get through this, and you will be a stronger person.

I guess the takeaway from all this is that if you get dismissed, you can still come back. It will be hard. It will suck. But you will be a stronger person. I am a more
productive person now that I ever was, even tho I did so good in high school, I am 10x better now. And check your emails too :)"

I'm a 25 year old student who is finally coming back to school after getting out of an abusive relationship and some other stupid, hard shit. I can be pretty depressive so the experiences I'm taking on right now have got me pretty low. 

I guess my major problems are this: I wasn't a stellar academic in highschool, my family life was a huge stressor, but I've never ever ever failed. I'm a hard worker, a hard studier - but my stress can come out and ruin progress as (you probably know) it can make it hard to remember/ retain information as well as concentrate. 

My first round of midterms turned out like this: A, F, D (FST 10, BIS 002A, CHE 002A). I'm just so dissapointed/ mortified with myself - even though these grades seem to be class average, I just expected better, I guess. The whole thing has me in tears and I'm getting to a bad place. I don't think it helps that I've not really settled into any friend groups and I feel like a stick out (in a bad way) when socializing as I've always been a bit maladjusted and friends have never been easy for me to come by. 

I don't know, I guess I just needed to say all of this to someone. I must be studying wrong/ the wrong content as I study every night but I still get these sorts of grades. I've tried Khan Academy/ Crash Course/ Practice Problems but maybe I'm just not a great test taker. Any advise there? Or any advise in where to find 25 year old type people to hang out with/ other people who won't be completely turned off by my age? 

Thank you in advance.

It emphasizes relaxation, sensitivity, structure, and speed rather than force and strength. Wing Chun uses arm strikes, leg strikes, trapping and control techniques as part of its fighting arsenal. Legend has it that the style was created by a Shaolin nun named Ng Mui and was first taught to a young woman named Yim Wing Chun in order for her to defend herself against a local warlord. The art continued to be passed down hundreds of years later to famous masters such as Ip Man and Bruce Lee. Simple and easy to learn, practitioners become effective extremely quickly through Wing Chun’s unique and innovative teaching system.

7chpu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/7chpu2/christian_cult_on_campus_20_new_song_ministries/,Christian Cult on Campus 2.0 (New Song Ministries),73,39,2017-11-12 12:04:30,"Throwaway account for anonymity.

There's a ""Christian"" group on campus that recruits people near the MU by asking them to take a survey or trivia quiz or something similar. This group has gone by several different names. Right now they're called New Song, but in the past they've been called Religare, Light Ministries, and Zion. They'll probably change their name again. Here is a warning post from February 2017, when they went under a different name: https://redd.it/5thsph

This group is part of a cult called [Shinchonji](https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-07-11/apocalyptic-korean-christian-group-goes-different-names-critics-say-its-just-cult), but they hide this fact until their followers have been with them for a long time. At first, their teachings seem very sound. The leaders obviously know Scripture very well, and they're very friendly. I was drawn to them. I didn't suspect anything strange until others alerted me, and even when they did, I couldn't fully believe there was anything weird about this group.

But of course a cult isn't going to straight-up tell you they're a cult; they have to lure you in first. I did some research. Apparently Shinchonji has considerable traction, even in the US, under many different front names (for example, one is Zion Mission Center in Santa Ana). They hide their true nature in the beginning so as not to scare people away.

These posts from 2012 were what finally convinced me. Thankfully I haven't been involved as long as the OP had been, but so far, everything resonates with me: http://jmscult.com/forum/index.php?topic=872.0

From the 2012 post: ""This group tricks Christians into participation by withholding information, lures them in through starting with non-controversial lessons, building seemingly caring relationships, and using guilt as a weapon. Early lessons are about the importance of Biblical knowledge and how the Pharisee’s lack of knowledge caused them to reject Jesus when he was right in front of them. This lays a groundwork that dupes participants into buying the more extreme ideas taught in later lessons. Those that see it for what it really is and call it a cult are compared to the Pharisees that rejected Jesus.""

The beginning small groups I've attended focus exactly on those points. They also emphasize the importance of learning the ""mysteries"" of the Bible; the true meanings of Revelation and Jesus' parables and whatnot. In other words, knowledge that only the cult can feed you. Ultimately, they believe that complete understanding of Revelation and the parables is what guarantees salvation.

In that post, OP talks about the small group transitioning into a class, which is the next step in the brainwashing/grooming/conversion process. It's the same in my experience. Without warning, our small group leader told us we would transition into a class during winter quarter. They gave us very little information about this so-called theology class, yet a bunch of us blindly filled out applications for it anyway.

This group seems to target new Christians, and Christians who are dissatisfied with the Bible studies that Navs, Koinonia, Cru, etc. have. (Many Bible studies on campus are conducted as discussion groups led by peers, and some students think this lacks structure.) Because these dissatisfied Christians are looking for a Bible study leader, New Song (or whatever the heck they want to call themselves) snatches them up, and the students are more likely to believe what their leader tells them.

If you come across a group that has a different name but sounds very similar, stay alert. It's probably still them."

I can't be in the living room because he's in there 90% of the time.  It is such a FOUL odor and he's about 21 years old now.  I would think he knows how to properly clean himself.  He constantly judges others on how they appear/sound/smell/act--but yet his scent makes me gag.  Honestly.
He is sensitive and has a loud mouth...basically will get offended like no other if I say anything.

What do I do?

I tried to hint that Im going to they store to get deodorant and asks if he wants to go...
I have said Damn whats that smell? To hint.
I have sprayed febreeze like a mother fucker infant of him to hint like dude something stinks...

I dont wanna live in hostility because he gets all mad that I say that he smells like complete BO which makes me gag.

Edit: -My throat, now, has an autonomous function to close/swell up/ become very tight when I am around him because the odor makes me just want to breathe as little oxygen as possible
-I am having to breathe out of a small hole formed by my lips while I am around him (no full breaths)

It works in two pass times. You can get your pass time at this [link](https://my.ucdavis.edu/schedulebuilder/index.cfm) starting May 7th, 2018. When you register, you must register for at least 12 units to be considered a full-time student (and get full financial aid). Waitlisted classes do not count as registered, ie having 8 units registered and 4 waitlisted will not make you considered a full time student. Registration works in two passes. The first pass allows you to register for up to 17 units, no waitlisting. Second pass allows up to 19 units and enables waitlisting. Waitlisted units will count towards this maximum. After each pass is an open registration period where you do not have to wait for your pass time appointment to register. After all of this is schedule adjustment, which is like open registration, but you can register/waitlist up to 28.5 units. Specific dates are available [here](https://registrar.ucdavis.edu/calendar/registration).
These two Chrome extensions may be useful:

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/schedule-builder-export/dahicfbjacnkkdhphlloeeaadkenloaf?hl=en-US

By the way, when Schedule Builder says M T W R F, the R is Thursday. May seem like a no-brainer, but it tripped me up first time I saw it.

&amp;nbsp;

**Bikes**

Bikes are really useful since the campus is very big. It makes a 15-20 min walk to your next lecture into a 5 min bike ride. Do not bring anything too flashy/expensive. It will get stolen no matter how well it is locked up, especially if left out overnight.

1. No quick releases. If anything is getting stolen off your bike, it will be something [quickreleased](http://justyna.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/06/13/p1210007_2.jpg). Replace it with something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Delta-Axlerodz-Bolt-Bicycle-Skewers/dp/B000ACAMKG).

2. No cable locks. No lock is impervious, but at least U-locks can't be [cut with scissors](https://youtu.be/K32gKwdbefg?t=30s) ([or pliers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqMbNOYtiEg)). Get a U-lock or chain lock. LOCK YOUR FRAME TO THE POST, NOT YOUR FRIGGIN TIRE. If you are extra paranoid, you can use [two bike locks](https://bikeindex.org/assets/Locking-8cfdfe6d5dbb733e2a2ad294b946c51f7de814633f56dd10db0f6e8c0459e0cf.svg) 

3. Your seat. Seats get stolen so friggin often. Either get one of the aforementioned skewers or [lock it to your frame](http://www.bikewhenever.com/locking/seat_lock_with_cable.jpg).

&amp;nbsp;

**Professors**

RateMyProfessor.com can be a useful tool, but it is not always accurate and reviews are often affected by bias or just outdated.
This isn't high school anymore. You're an adult. Most of your professors don't care about you. You're just another student ID on their class roster. It differs from professor to professor, but you will usually not get everything you need to be successful from lecture. Make use of TA and professor office hours (these are usually on the syllabus). Make use of tutoring that is offered for free here. Unless you really know your stuff, your first quarter will really suck if you don't make use of these resources.
On a side note, don't be *that* guy who always interrupts the class to ask a question that they could simply email the professor/email a TA/Google/read an assigned reading/etc. It takes time away from an already short lecture. You can always write down your question and do one of those things listed above.

&amp;nbsp;

**Curves**

If you don't know, a curve is when the professor decides the class's grades are too low (ie 50% average) and chooses to raise everyone's grade slightly (say up to 70%). This is only done by certain professors in certain classes in different ways: every professor has a different type of curve. **Don't rely on curves**, but if the class is really that hard, just focus on staying above the average. That way, if the professor raises the average from say 50% to 70% and you are at 51%, you will still pass.

&amp;nbsp;

**Changing major**

It is relatively easy to change your major here, even to different colleges. Essentially, each major has its own set of requirements to change to (ie [Computer science](http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/undergraduate/cs/change-of-major/) vs [Mechanical/Aerospace engineering](http://mae.ucdavis.edu/changing-majors/)). As long as you meet those requirements, you can simply submit an online form and then an adviser will email you to set up an appointment to officially change it. If you ever are in doubt, email your intended major's adviser or [set up an appointment](https://appointments.ucdavis.edu/).

&amp;nbsp;

**Taking summer classes**

You can do [Summer Session here for ~$1400 for four units](https://summer.ucdavis.edu/fees/index.html). This is useful if you are needing to make up some GPA, or need to meet minimum progress. However, some people have a one-off class (as in it is a requirement for your major, but isn't really something you need to know for your major and is somewhat rigorous) like CHE 2A for CSE. However, you can take it over the summer at community college, which would relieve a lot of the stress. I would recommend talking with an adviser first, but you can take some classes at community college for [~$46 per unit](http://www.losrios.edu/lrc/lrc_tuitionfees_summer.php) and transfer them here. However do *not* take a single class in a series at a CC if you need the whole series for your major (ie MAT 21A if you also need B, C, and D).

I spoke to an Academic Advisor, and was referred to the OSSJA for help managing my case. cool. OSSJA case manager is helpful and supportive, provides me resources and tells me there's a wonderful friend of hers who's a psychologist and has helped so many. Ok, cool. Well, we arrange my appointment on the spot, and apparently there's paperwork to fill out first, along with surveys. It takes my 40 minutes of our allotted hour to finish everything, at which point the psychologist randomly shows up and says, ""Hey, we've got twenty minutes to talk and that's going to be our session.""

So after twenty minutes of explaining my situation and trying to understand wtf she's saying through her thick accent (which is just me ranting, not her fault), she essentially tells me she can't do jack for me, and refers me to a person who will help me arrange a long-term therapist. 

Why the fuck do we have a useless middleman? Is their job simply to sit through an hour of random students asking for help before shooing them off with a referral to another guy?

Moreover, why is there no clear communication? Don't send me on a wild goose chase.Fucking tell em straight what I need to do, who I need to see.

And finally, why is the website such a fucking awful mess of UI? There's several categories that seemingly overlap in purpose, all the tabs are the same size, shape, font, etc. so you have no idea where to go, and to this day I've still no clue how to scheldue a simple counseling appointment via the website.

1:1 ratio of administrators to instructors, and you still have to deal with bureaucratic bullshit while these guys take home sizeable paychecks for not doing shit, and all while our tuition is raised behind closed doors in *Sac* with armed guards posted at the doors.

Even with loans maxed out and full tuition scholarship, as well as working outside of school, I am barely making ends meet. I work so much, I struggle to sleep enough or make it to my professors’ office hours when I need to. I obviously don’t have time to do extracurriculars and social stuff so I haven’t made many friends at school. I share rent with someone else in a cheap slum apartment and still don’t know how anyone can afford to live in this town. 

I struggle to pay for textbooks, many of which are UC Davis exclusives that you can’t rent or buy used. After several quarters here, I finally found out about the reserve copies available in the library. It would have been fucking nice for at least one professor to have mentioned this early on, rather than just assuming everyone in these classes can afford to drop hundreds of dollars a quarter on books.

I barely passed another class due to lacking a computer at home. This was not a computer-related class, and nowhere in the course description did it say we needed to learn computer programming in order to complete the homework. When your TA is teaching R in discussion and you lack a laptop, it is almost impossible to follow along and later adequately reproduce it all by yourself with no help on a library computer.
I often go without healthcare because I have to pay out of pocket for everything, and I constantly hear “Why don’t you have SHIP?” Am I literally the ONLY FUCKING PERSON on this campus that doesn’t have $2000 to spend on a health plan every year? 

The worst part is the assumptions from everyone that I have the disposable money to pay for these things or parental help, and I feel very isolated. My advisors and counselors keep saying I’m not the only person here with financial difficulties or no family support, but it definitely feels like it. I feel inferior to all of the other students here and don’t feel like I can talk to anyone. I hate this fucking school and wish I hadn’t chosen to go here. "

**if anyone has recommendations for mental health places i can start calling that will help me through the process and have kind doctors please recommend them cause honestly after this quarter i just need to get help before its too late. thanks for reading, good luck with the rest of your finals guys.**

EDIT: Thank you everyone for the quick and detailed replies, it means the world to have this much support. I will be sure to ask if I have further questions about the process, which I am sure I will. Wishing you all the best, stay dry out there!

I had a question for any of you guys who’ve dealt with being dismissed by the school for a quarter because you did not meet minimum progress. I am a sophomore now. 

To keep this short, I failed a class for my major during freshman year, spring quarter. Not to get into any specific details, but I was sexua!!y assau!ted (don’t know if I could say that on here lol) and so I ultimately didn’t meet minimum progress. 


Then last quarter, I was dealing with the aftermath of the assau!t and was receiving threats from the guy. That led me into thinking about whether or not to report. It kind of messed with me mentally. I ended up getting two D’s, and one A. 


This quarter, I needed to take 15 units and if I passed these all, I would be able to be in good academic standing again. I’m taking a math class at the moment, and logistically, I don’t think I will be able to pass the class. I’ve never been good at math, so dealing with all of this has kind of taken a toll on my time. I definitely know that when there was time I should have been studying for math, I was thinking about what happened to me. I did decide to report my incident, and I am currently in the middle of a legal case with the police. Needless to say, this has also affected me but I try to push through it.


You may ask why I didn’t take the quarter off. I chose not to because I thought school would be a good distraction and I didn’t want what happened to me to affect my school situation. I didn’t want him to dictate whether or not I attend school. For the most part, I know that I will never get over this. I have been receiving help at CARE, counseling, and my academic advisor. My perpetrator does go to Davis as well so despite all of this, it’s still tough for me to overcome. I pride myself on being a good student because I really do work hard and before last SQ, I had fantastic grades. 


So with all that being said, the only option for me is to file an appeal to not be dismissed for the next quarter. I do know that it is my fault that I am in this position but I really am so honored to be a student here and I’m hoping it all works out in the end. I’m doing everything in my power to continue being a student here, getting my degree, and work my butt off! 


In addition, I have submitted a retroactive withdrawal for FQ 2018. My academic counselor said that she does see me getting the withdrawal of FQ 2018, as well as the appeal for the dismissal, but I’m just completely lost with what to do now.


Have any of you guys had a situation similar to mine? How did it work out for you?

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope all of ya’ll do really well on your finals. Good luck!!"

Feel free to bash downvote what have you. But after reading the recent post about MSM, I felt compelled to share my experience about **Cru (Campus Crusade for Christ)**

&amp;nbsp;

Okay, before I start, want to share a little nerdy historical fact:

&amp;nbsp;

The Crusades were “a medieval military expedition, one of a series made by Europeans to recover the Holy Land from the Muslims in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries.” What resulted was a bloody war between Christians and Muslims, with tens of thousands of people dying as a result. It started from what was supposed “good intent” and religious fervor. Many countries participated in it… But just because a lot of people are in it, doesn’t mean it’s something that they SHOULD be in. 


&amp;nbsp;

So...that’s why many are starting to realize too about this campus ministry network called “CRU”. Not just people who used to be part of Cru but even Cru themselves. The reason they shortened their name to CRU was to distance themselves from the Crusades. Their president said they don’t want to seem “too aggressive” so they changed their name…. Maybe there’s something more to that claim. CRU seems like a legitimate Christian organization, but if you look at the things they are doing, their actions are not so different from the radical Christians of the Crusades. They love doing things their own way and have their own viewpoints on things. If you are in their way, they know how to get you since they are a  “national” organization and they claimed to know best how to help students grow in their faith. Yeah, right. &gt;&lt;


&amp;nbsp;

CRU is a money-sucking waste of your time, whose purpose is to lead people away from Christ and into the world. They take people’s money in the name of “fundraising” and they make people be completely devoted to them only. Let me tell you the insider story of how they carry out their cunning schemes.


&amp;nbsp;


**“Money money money, it’s all about money, in the Cru’s world”**
If you leave the ministry, don’t count on remaining close friends with the people in CRU. From being in the ministry, I found out that many CRU staff members are paid by the organization to take care of the members there, so when I left I was told they could no longer meet with me as they had before. Doesn’t that mean they were meeting for the purpose of receiving a paycheck? Does that means the relationship that was established between the staff and the students is based on money? And yet they claimed to be “always there for you, support you blah blah blah..”


&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, I left CRU for another ministry and to my surprise they began to persecute me, even going as far as spreading malicious rumors to my friends. I was really shocked. I know others who have experienced the same for their various ministries. It seems as though any ministry besides theirs is considered by them to be a “cult,” and they won’t refrain from spreading groundless accusations against those ministries or the people who leave. Does that even make sense?! When I asked them if they knew anything about the ministry, what it teaches, or have talked to the people inside it they had not done any of those things. That’s pretty messed up!  Who ever persecuted other believers in the Bible? It is also common for them to talk amongst each other about the members. This might be okay if they kept it to themselves or tried to help, but on more than one occasion news of a CRU member’s sin or difficulty has ended up spreading throughout the organization and being referenced as a bad example. It felt horrible  to hear so much gossip from other believers in the same ministry, and the members who were struggling often ended up leaving with no friends and a loss of faith.


&amp;nbsp;


**“If you want to remain friends, then you have to remain staff”**
Which is so strange because when  you first join, everyone is friendly and super-welcoming at first and suddenly you have about 15-20 instant ""new friends"". As a freshman looking for a new community, everyone would be up for that.  But as you become involved, the pressure to start being ‘everything’ for Cru begins. You’re expected to bring in new members. Then they want you to become a bible study leader and recruit your own members even more. There seems to be this hierarchy that exists that you are pressured to move up in. Kinda like pyramid scheme in my opinion. My grades suffered and emotionally I was getting very stressed. When I told them I needed to take a break, they made it pretty clear that they would ""move on"" without me. There was no room to take a break. If you tried to step outside their ""track"" of progression you were essentially cut loose from all those wonderful instant friends you made and you faced being alone. I stepped out anyway, despite being ostracized, but I sought counseling because I felt so mentally exhausted from the pressure of this group.  


&amp;nbsp;


But even as I was struggling with this, I couldn’t help but feel a strange envy for those who did follow what they wanted you to do. There’s this idea that becoming staff is the highest thing you can achieve and it’s what you should be aiming for. Joining staff though means signing away all your individual choice. Little by  little they manipulate you into doing things their way, including who you can date. If you want to be staff, then there’s the expectation that you can’t date anyone except for someone that the staff approves of or selects for you. And they have to be staff too. It’s like being staff is this super exclusive club of the very “elite” and that’s your goal as a Christian. But the staff don’t even know what they’re doing!! They think disciples should all be the same and that discipling happens in the same way for everyone too. Do they even match pairs according to their shared and mutual interests and their personalities? Feels more like either they like you and want to include you in their ‘inner circle’ of staff. They are not interested in getting to know you, more just interested in getting you to be what they want. Their main interest is winning you over to their group and then forgetting about you when you leave. There’s a reason why people call Cru “cookie cutter” and “bland”.  



&amp;nbsp;


The thing that hurt the most though was how pushy they are about everything and if you don’t fit their cookie-cutter mold of what you’re supposed to do, then you’re like nothing to them. 
Take this story from a former member. It’s not really an uncommon story. 



&amp;nbsp;


&gt;“This organization asked me to pay 43,000 dollars to spend 12 months in Italy for a ""mission trip"". When I said that I didn't have a job and I couldn't afford such an expensive trip, they scolded me because ""I wasn't trusting God"" and ""I would go to hell"". Also, ""God was offering me a job"" and ""I was refusing it"". It seemed to me that this ""mission trip"" was actually a long vacation, as it included excursions to Rome, Florence, Venice, Sicily and the Mediterranean sea. I told them that I preferred to volunteer in a prison, in a hospital, or among the poor. I could do that even in my area and there was no need to go to a tourist spot overseas. Again, I was ""following Satan"" instead of ""listening to God"". I was about to give in, and asked them how I should raise almost 50,000 dollars. They replied that I had to pray all the time, but most importantly I had to ask my relatives and acquaintances to pay a monthly fee to the organization. It looked like a huge pyramid scheme. I got upset and said that I wasn't going to rip off my relatives. After I left the organization, they continued to call me and sending me emails. In the end, I changed my cell phone number and my email address.” 


&amp;nbsp;


Fundraising for mission trips is important and I support that completely, but if you’re going to take my current financial situation and use it as a weapon to attack me and make me feel guilty  as if I’m not being a good christian by not being able to go these trips… that’s not fair at all. And then telling everyone on the staff that I’m going on a path towards sin and that my faith is being shaken and that people should take me as an example and warning… that is very hurtful. 


&amp;nbsp;


I feel like I am just venting here but this is my experience with Cru and you might have your own experiences. But hey that’s what the internet is for right? To share with one another. You can downvote this and you can get offended but what you can’t take away is the shame, guilt, humiliation, sadness, and isolation I felt. You won’t ever be able to “downvote” that away or claim that it’s not true. Just remember that before you are so quick to defend a ministry that would quickly throw you away too. “The best thing about Cru is that we’re all each other’s best friends” I wish I could have felt and said the same. I honestly do. "

They’re affiliated with the Davis Korean Church. Their supposed mission statement is ""being and making disciples of Christ” but all they’re interested in is making disciples after their own selves. They’re just into fellowship and being a community, but under the guise of helping people with their faith. I lost a lot of friends because of how exclusive they made my friends be to “show their dedication to God”, but they got nothing in return for this except just 4 years of serving some church that didn’t really care about them in the end. When a friend of mine fell out of faith after college, he didn’t get a single phone call from the pastor or the staff. Great shepherding ! I think it’s time everyone knew the truth regarding them.  

&amp;nbsp;


Freshman, beware. Don’t be fooled by their promises of free food or anything like that. If you just want a group of friends, then go join a campus club.

You’re not going to take in a lot of it… but this is one you should listen to, because it’s about your salvation and your faith, not just an org you’re joining.  
   
&amp;nbsp;


So what are some things that made me wary about MSM:     
   

&amp;nbsp;


**They push duties on the older members regardless of faith or Biblical knowledge. False teachers**     

&amp;nbsp;


I knew an upperclassman, and he had been in their ministry for a couple years. He wasn’t really active in his church and faith. I’m not sure why (maybe because they were lacking in staff), but they gave him a staff role as soon as they lost another leader. He was a nice guy for the most part, but in terms of faith and understanding of the Bible he was definitely not someone in the position to mentor others. I don’t know, it just makes me think of that part of Hebrews where Paul tells them they ought to be teachers, but still need to learn the basics. MSM should at least instruct those they raise as leaders if they’re going to raise anybody; unless the leadership themselves lack in the skills and Biblical knowledge to do so. Duties are pushed on the older members regardless of whether they’re equipped.   

&amp;nbsp;


You might think, “well in the Lord, all things are possible” and “He calls us even though we’re unequipped/lacking”. That’s true, God takes the insufficient to show His glory but if that person is standing up there at small group to lead the people in a time of worship and learning about the BIble, shouldn’t they at least know the Bible? If all it takes to lead a study group is to be able to read off a handout, then why not let a donkey speak in their place? At least that’d be Biblical. I don’t think it’s right to be told that you’re being taught God’s word, when it’s not. That’s deceitful. And that’s leading those who are falsely leading and teaching to judgment as well (take a look at James 3:1 if you’d like). 
    
&amp;nbsp;

**They’ve had 5 head pastors in the past 6 years, no one wants to lead a dying, corrupted ministry** .    


MSM is a part of a larger ministry and church, DKC (Davis Korean Church). If you look into the history of that place, it’s a little bit concerning. How long do you expect a pastor to stay with a church? I’d expect him to stay at least a few years if possible, for the body to be properly raised into something that can grow with a little help. However, if you probe you’ll find that DKC has had five head pastors in the past six years. If it was just one or two who left, you could chalk it up to something on their part; but when it’s five or six it can’t be anything other than the church itself. There must be something really wrong with this place.
    
&amp;nbsp;


  Essentially, MSM functions like an abandoned child. This isn’t to put them down, but it’s the sad reality of things. I wish I could say they’re in a good position a ministry, but how is it supposed to help anyone else when it can’t help itself. No wonder a lot of their leaders drink alcohol and encourage people to join KASA drinking events. The faith fall-out rate is really high after-college for MSM. Maybe once they leave college, they’re able to realize the hypocrisy they were once in. It’s really sad.   
  

&amp;nbsp;


**Christianity without the Bible** . 
Take a look at a recent newsletter of theirs:
https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/40b77f_ab814a4d05684a3d9b8c99945a6b439d.pdf . 
  
&amp;nbsp;


Their main activities as stated: Meeting together to enjoy a meal, encouraging one another through prayer and sharing, have conversations about how “our jobs, child-reading, marriages, relationships, money, rest.”     


&amp;nbsp;


Those are all things you can do… even if you’re not a believer. What’s so different between this and a sorority or even a good group of friends? Don’t you talk about all these things with friends too? So where’s God in this?     

&amp;nbsp;


Even other faiths do these things better than us. Where is the Bible in all this? They quote a couple Bible verses in this, but so did the devil when he tempted Jesus in the wilderness. Nothing about actually learning the Word or growing, just about worldly things and comfortable community. Even when they do have Bible studies, they don’t actually study the Bible. Instead, they read books that they just pick out of their own preference. But you're not allowed to question their choices or why we're reading those things instead of focusing on the Bible.  

    
&amp;nbsp;


**Questions? Too Bad! Non-korean? Too Bad!** 
That's a big part of this ministry: you're not allowed to question. Actually, you're not allowed to do a lot of things. Firstly, you're not allowed to be non-Korean if you're part of this ministry. Yup, that's right. You read correctly. On such a diverse campus, you're joining a very exclusive Korean-only club, even if they don't straight up tell you. You can feel the exclusion if you're non-Korean. Of course, what can you expect from joining a ministry that's from the Davis Korean Church. I guess non-Koreans are asking for too much when they're asking to be included within their community in Christ. They don't treat you with integrity if you're not Korean, so if you have some strange fantasy of being a part of them, then it's just a fantasy.  


&amp;nbsp;


  
All in all, why am I writing this? Because I think all the above are so wrong for a Christian community.   
Honestly, if you’re going to say that you’re a ministry based on following Christ, then you gotta follow his example and teachings too. Don’t be hypocritical, don’t act like you know, and don’t push people when they offer you suggestions for change. Don’t be racist. What happened to love for all humanity? Yeah, don’t expect that here because they talk badly about every other ministry on campus.   

&amp;nbsp;

  
Yeah, there are many good people in MSM who are nice and are there because they really wanted a community in Christ and this was the one that they stumbled across. I don’t blame them. Once you’re friends with everyone, I’m sure any group can seem good to you. But it’s the duty of a Christian to not follow man, but to please God. I hope those reading this can realize that truth is harsh but always comes out, no matter how much you try to hide it. MSM is a dying ministry; if you wondered what was happening, well maybe the incoming freshman are getting smarter. Maybe you need more than just free food and community to actually be a ministry and a church that is blessed by God. There are many ministries on campus; choose one that brings you closer to God. "

Why did you chose to go to Davis, and do you feel like you made the right choice? 

I'm just trying to gather general information and sort of get to know the campus. For reference I'm a transfer student looking to major in international relations and Russian language, but I'm interested to hear about your experience with any major. "

I have left lab crying and dread going each week to the point where I feel sick.

I’m at the point where the next time this TA is rude to me, I want to break down and remind them bluntly that my tuition pays their salary and to treat me with more respect, but I’m afraid they’ll force me to miss a lab and I’ll fail the class.

Your first year at Davis can be hard, I know some parts of it were for me, and I just thought that I'd share some really cool tips and trivia for all the incoming freshman that I wish someone had told me. 
______________________
**LIVING IN THE DORMS**

This is going to be one of the hardest parts at your time at Davis, just getting used to sharing a room with somebody. But it's also probably going to be one of the funnest and most interesting parts of your entire experience at UC Davis! You'll either make friends that you'll have the rest of your life, or find yourself dreading to leave your room because of your horrible depression! There isn't much of a middle ground, so you better choose one of those options fast!

1. You might find it difficult to start getting adjusted to your new roommate, especially if you don't have siblings or haven't really ever had to share a space with someone. If you and your roommate don't get along, you can always at any point fill out a roommate transfer form. Another common thing to do is become really passive aggressive towards your roommate and start constantly infringing on their space. Start eating durian on a regular basis, act incredibly weird, wake up in the middle of the night screaming, and solve all your conflicts by leaving angry sticky notes on your roommates desk, worded strongly, but with a smiley face at the end so that they know you're just joking. You'll have a new roommate in no time!

2. If you're from a wealthier background, it might be difficult having to live near, interact with, speak to, or even look at your new hall mates, most of whom will be poorer than you. Buy an expensive BMW, Cadillac, or Mercedes, quickly find yourself a cohort of douchey rich Chinese hypebeasts, and blast ~~shitty~~ fuckin' dope hiphop out of your super awesome aftermarket subwoofer in the nearby parking lot in the middle of the night. Those less fortunate than you won't even want to talk to you anymore because of how awesome you are

3. The signs in the DC may ask you to clean up your plates after yourself but trust me, the staff will take care of it for you. You're paying this school $40,000 a year, might as well get your money's worth.

4. If you want to make friends fast, leave a couple of bottles of wine out in the common areas for everybody with a note attached that has your full name and room number. Everyone will really appreciate it.

5. Staying in your room, never leaving, and ordering all of your food off of JoyRun is also an option. This is works better if you're in a single: you can easily just listen to the sounds your computer fan makes for socialization, or hug your waifu and pretend she's your roommate.

6. If you're considering bringing a car to Davis, racking up parking tickets in the parking lots is cheaper than buying a parking pass.
_______________________

**ACADEMICS**

School can be hard, and the most important thing to remember is that the university doesn't care about you or your academic well being unless they can find a reason to kick you out! So don't be scared and just embrace the constant state of panic and anxiety, because if you don't you'll probably find yourself considering jumping off the watertower. 

1. Don't be afraid to drop a class if the teacher is bad, or you're having a hard time personally, or for whatever other reason. In fact feel free to drop all of your classes, you'll still be considered a full time student as long as your reregister within a year, the university is extremely lenient about that type of stuff. 

2. If your professor gives you a bad grade, just approach them after class, they're always willing to hear you out. If you insult their teaching ability, make fun of their accent, and threaten to sue them if they don't give you a better grade, you'll definitely get a couple of extra credit points, and maybe even a grad school letter of recommendation!

3. The best way to make the most of your time at UC Davis academically is to transfer to another better school, like Berkeley, or Merced. 

4. NPB, BioChem, Engineering, CS, or anything pre-Med will be easy A's all the way through college. If you're looking for something more challenging, consider IR, PoliSci, or Art History.
_______________________
**SOCIAL LIFE**

Making friends might be difficult at first, but hey, thank God you're not a transfer student! Through getting involved in campus activities, you'll eventually find yourself some friends, and maybe even someone who's as interested in depressed day drinking as you are!

1. Join every club you can. Seriously, it will make a difference. There should be no exceptions to this, if you pass a club tabling next to the Quadrilateral by the MemoUni, join them and attend every meeting. Anybody worth their salt in the job market is going to have at least 100 clubs under their belt so I would recommend more than that. Davis has around 800 student organizations, joining every single one would be beneficial to your resume. 

2. If you're a guy and ever feeling lonely, the Pantry in the basement of the Memorial Union (also called the MemoUni) has free condoms. Grab some, take them back to your room, and masturbate as hard and fast as you want! No cleanup necessary, just take it off afterwards, throw it in the trash, and voila! 

3. If you're looking to date somebody, the best possible place to find an attractive person is on the Facebook Free and For Sale page. Oddly enough, while other campuses have Bumble and Tinder, Free and For Sale (otherwise known as FAFSA) is the prime dating spot at UC Davis. Just spot somebody you might be interested in, message them pretending to express interest in the product they're selling, and show up at their house later that evening for your date!

4. A commonly heard thing is that you can't actually be part of more than one social fraternity. What's not known too well is that there's a loophole around that. If you're part of a frat or sorority, rush for the other one, get accepted, and then don't tell the first one. Problem solved!

5. Speaking of fraternities, if you're a guy maybe looking to get into some Greek life, considering rushing for the best fraternities in UC Davis: Theta Xi and Pike. 

6. There are no limits to the amount of alcohol you should drink, black out drunk just means you know you're having a good time, especially if you're alone. 

7. If the social life isn't exactly your cup of tea, remember: friends may not last forever, but the experiences you'll have bingeplaying League of Legends, Overwatch, or Destiny will.

**FUN FACTS &amp; TIPS:**

1. Walking on the train tracks is a great way to get around town. The trains are programmed to avoid you if they see you so it's completely safe. 

2. If you're looking for a ride to the Bay Area, Uber is going to be the cheapest option.

3. If you're looking for a good place to jogging at night, the arboretum is ideal. Nobody's around giving you some peace and quiet, and the lighting is minimal so as not to distract from your exercise.

4. The best coffee in town is a little known quirky hole-in-the-wall cafe called Starbucks in the University Mall by Segundo.

5. When walking to class, it's considered perfectly alright to take a shortcut by walking straight through the bike circles. Riders will generally be able to avoid you so it's very safe.

6. UC Davis cares a lot about the mental health of their students, which is why they provide an  incredibly easy to use system where you can instantly book a same or next day appointment with a world class psychological specialist at the mental health clinic here. If you're experiencing any sort of mental health crisis, this is the perfect place, considering just how much time, effort, and money goes into making sure all the students are healthy and taken care of. The past 20 years have only seen about 2 or 3 dozen suicides, which should be a clear indicator of how well we handle those struggling with things!

7. If you're ever feeling the farm-town blues and want to get out of Davis for a while, just remember that you're surrounded by miles of and miles of farms and fields, and that there is no escape. Plus, if you do find a way to get out for a weekend, your desk will be surrounded by miles and miles of reading and essays that you needed to do over the weekend, so you'll have that to look forward to once you get back!

After this I decided to attend tutoring through an outside resource. The tutor is very helpful and a few days before the test he gave me 3 practice exams with answer keys. I practiced these exams heavily show up to take my test later in the week. The exam ends up being very similar and some of it was the exact same as what the tutor gave me. So I come back the next week with my professor accusing me of cheating because some of my answers were the exact same as the answer key. I told him exactly what happened and he said that he will adjust my score on the that test based on how I do on the final. Can he do this? Also after noticing that the exam was very similar I got curious and looked up questions from my exam 1, lone be hold, he stole it from another university, same thing with exam 2 when I looked it up. It was all online, a previous semesters test from a different university. "

92g0ho,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/92g0ho/to_the_guests_this_summer_and_incoming_freshmen/,To the guests this summer and incoming freshmen eating in the DC..,66,16,2018-07-27 13:23:19,"Reposted because people should know:

Edit SUMMER DC 2018: PLEASE stop clapping when a student/worker/guest drops a plate or bowl! I'm witnessing this while I'm working every shift (almost every day). One day, a guest dropped a bowl at the salad bar, and a couple of table erupted into applause and whooping, which led to a cascading effect of the entire DC joining in. I can't even imagine how embarrassed that student/guest was when all attention was focus on him. I don't know if you guys do this because it's ""cool"" or ""funny"", but it's not. It's cringy if you guys think it's ""cool"". It's also disheartening to us as workers when the attention is only focused on us dropping a plate or bowl rather than on the hard work we put in.

Please please please when you’re done with your meal, put your dishes and cups away. I’ve worked at the DC as a Dining Room Attendant and I’ve seen empty plates, bowls, and cups left on table for other DRA’s and I to put away. We have to walk back and forth to put them away for you guys (and we're standing and walking for a long time with only 15 minutes to sit down and rest). It’s really time consuming and super tiring having to walk across the DC when that time can be spent making the DC cleaner. It is our duty as student workers at the DC to make the DC clean and tidy for you guys, but you guys also have the responsibility of cleaning after yourselves when you guys are done eating. That means returning ALL your plates and cups to the dish return and returning the sauce bottles from where you've gotten them. It’s weird how some people expects us to clean after them when the majority of the people eating are doing the right thing and putting their stuff away. So to whomever leaves their plates and stuff to get up and leave, please clean up after yourself. That way we’ll be able to spend more time cleaning as much tables for you guys so you have somewhere clean to eat your meal. :)

Also it’s super rude when some people clap after a worker drops bowls or utensils while they’re restocking them. You may not know but more than half of the workers working in the dish room and even the person assigned to restock plates, bowls and utensils work around 5-7 hours each day. Because the DC is now opened all day, a lot of traffic comes in, which leads to plates and utensils to be used up quickly. This means that one person has to restock everything as fast as possible and they're wheeling carts full of dishes and bowls to each stations and utensils. A typical shift is this. A whole lot of people come in to eat, dishes and plates are being used up at an extreme pace. Chefs from multiple stations radio in to the person in charge of restocking the plates and asking him/her to come to their station with this and that. The number of utensils, salad and soup bowls are decreasing fast. Managers radio for the person to refill them here and there as quick as possible. Some chefs radios after a few minutes and ask the person to hurry and get plates over. Therefore, this person is wheeling a cart filled with heavy plates and bowls as quickly as possible without dropping them, and this is very, very tiring. Honestly, they don't have time to catch a break and sit down for a cup of water.

So it doesn’t really help when people are being asses and clapping at this when that person is working very hard.

We work really hard to make your dining experience as enjoyable and clean as possible, so please don't make it hard for us to do so!"

I'm a researcher at UC Davis based out of the Center for Neuroscience ([http://neuroscience.ucdavis.edu/contact-us/index.html](http://neuroscience.ucdavis.edu/contact-us/index.html)). I am recruiting for a brain imaging study (functional MRI). This involves lying in an MRI scanner while you watch video clips, and then while you recall those clips from memory into a microphone. Afterwards, you'll do a quick out-of-scanner true/false recognition test. Your time in the scanner should be about 1-1.5 hours, and only about 0.5 more hours outside of the scanner. Compensation is $20/hour, so $40 total for the 2 hour time slot. As an aside, the task is very easy and a lot more entertaining than your typical functional MRI experiment. Also, I'm happy to give you high-resolution pictures of your brain =)

It's not much, but -$60 is better than no change and certainly better than an increase.

The $60 fee was originally instated to recover the costs of defending the UC in two class-action lawsuits.

Kashmiri v. Regents: The University breached its contracts with the professional students when it raised the professional educational fees for continuing students after promising on its website and in its catalogues that such fees would not be raised for the duration of the students' enrollment in the professional program. The UC lost the suit and had to pay $42 million in damages.

It was the same issue, but a different group of students in Luquetta v. Regents. The UC lost this suit as well to the tune of $49 million."

1. Say I wake up and intend to take a shower, use the bathroom, and wash my teeth. This will require me to take a large amount of equipment to the bathroom, such as towels, toothpaste, toothbrush, etc Should you first go and take a shower, then come back to put your towels away to then go back in the bathroom to use the toilet? 

2. If I attempt to go to the bathroom during the morning to use the toilet and to take a shower, will there be a place in the shower to put my stuff, such as shampoo? Will I have to place it on the floor? How big will this place be?

3. If I go to the bathroom to use the toilet and to take a shower, I will have to take my shower equipment with me. If I want to use the toilet first, do I go In wearing just my towel to the toilet, use the toilet, and then use the shower? 

4. If you intend to take a shower In the morning, do you usually bring all your bathroom/shower equipment with you at once or do you go back to your dorm after using the shower for example to get your toothbrush. Where do you place your toothbrush when using the toilet? On the floor? 

5. When you go to the bathroom to shower, what do you wear? Do you get naked in your dorm room, then put on a towel and walk to the shower, take a shower, put the towel back on to walk to your dorm and then get naked to put your clothes on? Or do you do this: walk to the bathroom with your normal clothes on, take a shower, walk back to your dorm, and put on your new clothes? 

6. What percentage of males use a bathrobe? Mine looks to be made out of wool or cotton, which is different than being made completely out of a towel. Is this ok?

7. What is the time that I must wake up at in order to take a shower alone or say with only one other person? What time is the busiest?"

I have had clinical depression for years now and its made it impossible for me to be social and enjoy doing things i used to like such as gaming. ive felt really confused over some things my parents did in the past and its so bad that i am beginning to dissociate and lose my sense of self. I look extremely depressed and i come off as very unpleasant around other people (and i hate to admit that, but its true...). smiling just doesnt work cuz it comes out as fake to others and it doesnt feel natural for me to. Having this destroyed my whole social life in high school and on top of working in a summer job, volunteering, and just being around people in general. 

I complained about this to all of my counselors at school (my guidance counselor and two mental health specialists ) but they all told me that it was something i just had to live with, possibly for the rest of my life. I tried getting my parents to listen but they abuse me over the issue when i try to talk about it. So i just tried to solve it myself for months now and its just going nowhere, and my outside therapist has no clue how to help me. i genuinely feel sad that everyone around me has friends and a group while im just alone and so miserable in this state.

When summer started, coming home made me feel really happy, and i've been having less of suicidal thoughts, but as the days come closer, and I have to come back into college, i'm getting more anxious and stressed.

Jokes aside, I posted this in a comment section, but i just want everyone who might carry pepper sprays in the future with them due to recent robberies to see this. Again, DO NOT USE PEPPER SPRAYS AGAINST ARMED ROBBERIES (either a firearm or a knife)

Robberies usually involve more than one suspect and certain weapons, such as a firearm or a knife, so using a pepper spray in this situation can only escalate the situation and make the attackers more aggressive.

Unless you are trained AND have similar level of force multiplier, the safest thing to do in an armed robbery unfortunately is to follow the robbers’ instructions. Since the whole campus is within a gun free zone (including the parking lot where the robbery took place), please do NOT carry a firearm (EVEN IF you are CCW) or a taser. It is OK to carry a knife, but unless you are well trained and know what you’re doing, do not be stupid enough to try to fight. 


(a little bit political here but i believe it’s very relevant to everyone of us in this situation) I know it seems to be unfair that criminals can carry whatever they want but you have to follow the laws; however, under the current regulations, this is all we can do to protect ourselves without risking being charged and losing our enrollments and some rights. What this to change? Vote! Read the laws that are coming out and vote against any type of *unfair* laws that only prevent us from protecting ourselves and does pretty much nothing to restrict the criminals. (p.s.: go to vote is all I am saying. I am not accusing any people with any political beliefs that might have led to the current regulations because they were voting what they believed was the best based on what they’ve experienced, and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. and no, i do not think everyone should own a rocket launcher. )

and please post other suggestions below or point out if there’s anything i need to correct, and i will make edits

I feel like i could really use some advice because i think that i wont survive for long without help..

1. I bought a used fixed gear bike from facebook for $150, and it worked fine at first but it had a ton of hidden issues that came with it. The pedal came loose due to a broken crankarm, and i tried to get it fixed at the bike collective. No one there seemed interested to help me (they were all volunteers, so i guess they werent obligated to) and i just left feeling dejected and ignored by them. 

2. This was basically my fault, but i bought a crate to store groceries with and i was planning on attaching it to the front of my bike. I couldnt fit it because the handlebars are very close to the front wheel, which is unlike most other bikes ive seen. And when i was riding in the streets my chain fell off the gears and i had to run into a curb to stop my bike (hella scary...). I just walked my bike home the rest of the time and i dont know what to do with it anymore. 

3. For groceries ive been trying to gauge different places around to buy them. I tried grocery outlet, which has cheap prices but im not sure if the selections there are any good because they tends to be expired/lower quality than those at other stores. Safeway is closeby but its kind of expensive for me, and i dont know anything about target. Im receiving $192 in food stamps per month but i have no idea what my budget is and im trying to play it safe for as long as possible.

4. As for meeting people I come off really depressed and making new friends feels impossible for me to do. I tried talking with my new roommate but we had a couple of awkward encounters and i feel like the relationship died out already. I lost interest in most of my hobbies and when i try to get back into them, im really lousy at it no matter how much effort i put into it. I feel a constant numbness and discomfort that never goes away and it feels miserable. i tried to fix it for years but ive been unsuccessful most of the time, and even when i do i just end up back in that state shortly afterwards.

9ftiz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/9ftiz2/game_thread_uc_davis_football_stanford_11am/,[GAME THREAD] UC Davis Football @ Stanford (11AM Saturday),35,10,2018-09-14 09:34:23,"

Tomorrow UC Davis travels to Stanford in the biggest game of the season. In 2005, the Aggies, still transitioning from D2, [shocked the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nnY_ksDxh8) in an upset for the ages against the Cardinal. The Ags, now with more firepower than perhaps ever before, and already with an upset against a higher-division team under their belt, look to pull it off again.

Stanford is #9 in the AP poll, after beating San Diego State (who beat the Aggies last year) in Week 1 and U$C in Week 2. Stanford traditionally plays an old-school running offense that tries to overwhelm the defense with size and power, but showed they have an explosive passing game as well against SDSU. Now that Stanford announced that starting RB Bryce Love will sit this game, Aggie fans can expect that the Other Farm might turn to the air again -- not that we should underestimate their backup runners. Defensively, they look overall quite solid as well; Stanford locked down U$C in a 17-3 battle and caused SDSU's offense to stagnate for long periods.

Meanwhile, Davis runs the polar opposite offense -- an uptempo spread reminiscent of Oregon. The Aggies will try to advance through the air as quickly as possible, eventually opening up lanes for our backs. It's unclear at this point if any team in the country can outright stop the Aggie O when it's clicking, but the problem is that it doesn't take much time off the clock. Stanford might very well hold the ball most of the game, until the Aggie defense -- which has shown it's slightly above average, at best -- is tired.

That being said, I can't bring myself to predict against the Aggies on this one. UCD will get an early lead as Stanford adjusts to an offense faster than any they've faced this season, and the Cardinal offense won't be able to get anything going in the first half with their run game weakened. In the second, the score will tighten as the Aggie defense grows tired against a bigger, faster offense, but Stanford's comeback will be too little too late. 20-17 Aggies.

There's plenty. Also have heard of the ""Oakland Train Guy"" who used to be in Davis and pretend his car broke down and ask others for money for a train ticket. This used to be a repeated story, and he was a regular (last heard of in 2013 according to DavisWiki) - not sure if this is the same guy, but there's definitely plenty of people out here like this.

&amp;#x200B;

Last night, I was approached by an African American male \~6 feet near the Silo who was extremely polite and explained that his SUV was stuck in the parking lot near Sproul, and couldn't get out. He claimed he had called TAPS and they said he had to have cash (10-11$?) to pay for his parking spot, otherwise he would have to get a ticket. Granted, I was actually in a hurry to catch the bus and didn't have time to go check it for myself, but his story seemed pretty legitimate. In the midst of telling his story, he also subtly mentioned that the ATM was nearby (a red flag that I had missed until I realized afterwards), and he claimed he didn't have his wallet or cash on him. Being someone who likes giving people the benefit of the doubt and someone who would want to do the same thing for me if I was stuck in the same dilemma, I handed him a $20, all I had on me (despite already not being in the best financial situation at the moment). He seemed genuinely grateful and claimed he would pay me back, that he would be here from 8:30-4:45 the next day, his name was 'Patrick' and he worked at the MU. He also called my cell from his phone (in front of me) making it slightly believable. I've contacted him many times and he hasn't gotten back so I'm at a dead end.

&amp;#x200B;

I realize it was **very stupid** on my part to believe all of this, but there's definitely scammers still lurking around. If he tries the same thing again, it's more than likely he'll use the same story - he seemed serious and now I can believe it was scripted. It's great to help people out, but it's also best to do it directly (in a way where you can pay for them directly or have the peace of mind knowing they're not scamming you, in my case I was in a hurry so I couldn't think clearly). Please don't fall into the same trap as I did, it's absolutely revolting to profit off of someone's compassion or mercy.

This is the biggest freaking game in Aggie Stadium history and you do NOT want to miss this. After the best season since the Ags moved up from Division 2, not only did we get our first-ever FCS playoff berth but we got a home game with a storied FCS program!

UNI comes to town after having won their first-round game last week against another unranked team. UCD, being the #6 seed and coming off a bye, should be favored on paper, but Northern Iowa is from a really good conference and has been to the playoffs before. They'll try to keep the ball away from Davis' potent offense and grind out a victory like they did last week with a 16-13 brawl.

The Ags meanwhile, are hoping for clear skies, because we'll try to light it up in the passing game and won't want to challenge a physical midwestern team in a ground-based melee. We definitely have the offense to win in perfect conditions, but the Panthers know how to throw good teams off their game, like in their 24-3 pounding of an otherwise powerful South Dakota State team. The only two teams we've played on UNI's level -- Stanford and Eastern Washington -- were both losses, but neither were at a rocking Aggie Stadium (I'm sorry, UC Davis Health Stadium or something). This game will be the ultimate test of where we are as a program and how high our ceiling is. I think they'll stifle our usual numbers a bit, but scoring in the 20s won't do it for any team at Aggie Stadium. Take the Aggies, 35-21.

**Before the game:** Check out the student tailgate in the field next to the game where there's free entertainment and soft drings, $3 pizza, and $2 beer! What the heck, they never had this when I was a student.

**At start time:** Make your way over to the student section, where you get great seats at midfield! If you haven't picked up a ticket already you probably will still be able to ask for one at the ticket window.

**During the game:** Remember to be chill on offense but get LOUD when we're on defense! The point is to mess up the opponent's plays, not our guys'.

**After the game:** Be safe and make good decisions!

REMEMBER: 4 PM! BE THERE!"

Like I've done well in more traditional / non-theoretical courses like Nitta's 150, but this class has me so confused right now oh my gawd.

I follow lectures along fairly well but his homework is on a whole different level and the questions themselves are difficult to even understand, so it's so difficult just to get the ball rolling here.

Any advice? Gonna start going to office hours more often. The TA's are alright, they try to help but obvs they can't reveal too much and it usually just feels like there's a huge disconnect there because they don't really understand the confusion (I don't want to say condescending, but there's certainly a lack of them understanding the difficulty).

Also for those that have taken this in the past, how do grades work out? Might need to P/NP a class for the first time here, I don't know if he curves or anything. Genuinely concerned for this class, because his in-class quizzes seem more doable than the homework so far.

 Current member of the Senate table here. Elections are currently going on, however, most importantly, everyone should vote on the Unitrans Fee Referendum.

It would allow for the busses to run at the levels they are at, with no cuts on busses per hour nor lines operated. This is to compensate for the fact that Unitrans has to operate under new minimum wage requirements, new federal regulations, and others. So if you use the bus regularly or are just a NUMTOT, please vote in favor for it.

ASUCD has been working with the problem of Unitrans' defecit for a while now and we are hoping that the referendum can get the unit back in the green. For those interested, here is the background of the whole situation:

Background: Unitrans, the ASUCD operated public transit bus system that serves UC Davis and the Davis community, is experiencing rising operational costs due to State mandated annual minimum wage increases. The State minimum wage is currently $11 per hour and will increase $1 per hour per year until January 2022 when the minimum wage will reach $15 per hour. Unitrans has been operating with an annual operating deficit for two (2) years, relying on reserve funds to maintain current service levels. The deficit is projected to continue to increase and Unitrans’ reserves will be depleted by next academic year, 2019-20. Without additional funding, Unitrans service will need to be reduced by 25-30% in the next two years.

Currently, 90% of Unitrans daily passengers are registered UC Davis undergraduate students. The service is funded approximately half and half between undergraduate students through supportive fee referenda over the last 28 years and through the City of Davis. City of Davis revenues have increased over time however student fee revenue only increases with enrollment and not with rising prices or revenues.

The proposed fee referendum to support Unitrans service increases the current quarterly fee by $13.33 in fall 2019, followed by a $24.00 increase to be implemented gradually over three years followed by CPI adjustments thereafter in order to provide continued unlimited bus service and maintain current service levels.

One thing to keep in mind of our student fees is that they all go towards student wages, and are thereby supporting student employment opportunities on campus. (45% of expenditures goes to student wages and the rest to all other expenses i.e. fuel, bus parts, other salaries, w/ all student fees go back to student wages.)"

Anyway, I really feel for the people that are new to Davis because you’re right when you say it’s difficult to find yourself in this town. There are so many people here, and it takes awhile to jump in (or back in) to a community that’s in town.

That piano, even if it wasn’t the greatest, was my only way of venting; playing on it was at times more helpful than going to counseling services. And that gain pedal has been gone for seven weeks now.

The piano in Central Park is no longer there. The ones in the SPCA thrift store have been sold. I’m not a freshman, so the music rooms in the dorms are inaccessible to me, and are always occupied anyway. I’ve tried playing my uke but it’s not the same. My apartment is too small to fit a keyboard, as I’m living in a tiny 2bed 1 bath with four other roommates it’s crowded already. That piano was all I had, and to me, not being able to play is the equivalent of unhealthily bottling up feelings. Whoever is in charge, please, *please* fix it already. I’m not sure how much longer I can go without releasing my mental toxicity through music."

I haven't set foot on this campus since when I was 9 years old (9 years ago) for my brother's graduation. Now seeing it, I thought the campus was pretty, well-kept, and clean despite it being old. My favourite place on campus was the Memorial Union as there were comfy chairs to sit in and it was brightly lit. I also liked how there was an Amazon packing shop and many ATM Bank machines.

However, I was disappointed to learn (from you guys) that parking is a hassle. UC Davis is the largest campus in the whole UC-system and there are lots of open fields surrounding the campus. Why can't they add more car parks or parking garages? My aunt lives in Fairfield and I want to stay at her house to save money instead of staying at Primero Grove (or other transfer apartments) and it sucks to know that parking here is difficult. I might take the Solano Express for $40 a month instead of driving to UC Davis. Unfortunately, according to UCD's class schedules, Discussion Sessions are usually in the evening and there aren't any bus services at those times.

UC Davis may not be a perfect school, but there are a lot of things to appreciate about it and I hope to see it develop further before I come here in Fall 2020. 

Overall, I can imagine myself attending this world-class school (like my brother before me) as there are a lot of things to love about the campus. I was deciding between UC Davis, UC Irvine, and UC Santa Barbara for **TAG**, but I might choose UC Davis instead given that it's closer to my home and that the people here are so friendly and helpful (just like you guys)!"

We are all giving it our best shot out there, and we are all admitted to this university which means yes, we are good enough for this.

It’s okay to detour. It takes time to figure things out. Talk to a family/friend today, whoever will give you nothing but understanding and support. They will give you the motivation you need.

Take your time, get your thinking done, then try, try and try. You’ll get there eventually, because you are good enough. We have faith in you. Wish you the best of luck❤️"

Two of my classes were insanely difficult, and I was barely passing both. I had to quit 2 jobs in order to put all of my time and effort into the class that mattered the most (genetics). I was suicidal 3 times this quarter because I convinced myself that I couldn’t do it and that I was a failure. After consistently getting 60s &amp; 70s on the midterms, failing the canvas quizzes, etc, I studied my heart out for the final. You know what happened? I got a 96 on the final, 21% above the average, and a B+ in total for the class.

I’m writing this to let those who think they can’t do it, who think they’re Cs (or lower) won’t change, that it’s possible.

pros (almost all of it, but pointing some out): 
- obviously the huge amount of new equipment. I counted 20 racks in the weightroom itself and another 8 outside of it. The rack on the back of the pair also has a deadlifting platform. There are also 6 weightlifting platforms. There are now 6 flat benches, two of which are the ""handoff"" kind. About 14 adjustable free weight benches, and we finally have the shoulder press ""benches"" . 
- for you cardio folks, there are a million bicycles, treadmills, and other new cardio equipment (I saw a lot of rope climbing machines) 
- they have a sled, and I overheard the manager saying that they are also getting atlas stones and tires for the fitness area outside in the center of the building
- those cable machines by the stairs are wild (tip: use the ""free motion chest"" machine for a crazy chest pump) 
- no shitty music blasting on the speakers (this is a pro for me)
- the 5lb increments for the cables are fleshlights

cons (most are nitpicky): 
- I am not a fan of the level the hooks are set for the benches. I was really hoping we would get benches with adjustable hooks, but the current benches have the highest hook set way too low. I even have short arms, so I can't imagine how awkward it would be for people with average or long arms. 
- along the same lines, the hooks for the benches are way too ""deep"" so I found myself hitting the hooks a couple times, even though they are set low. 
- the squat rack pillars themselves (the things that hold the hooks) are too wide, and I ended up hitting the rack, causing the bar to bounce back once or twice. Watch out when reracking. It is not like the previous racks where the pillar was flush with he hook itself. 
- its also hot as balls in the weightroom. I see they have the AC to like 70 but even then, circulation seems to be poor. There are no fans above the racks??
- Most of the plate loaded machines only have enough pegs to hold 45 lb and 25lb weights, so you have to walk across for the 10s and 5s which is kind of an unfortunate change from the previous set of hammer strength machines. 
- I noticed that some of the old machines are missing. notably the hacksquat and the ""standing"" hamstring curl machines. 
- I also wasn't a fan of some of the Matrix plate loaded machines either. Specifically not a fan of the plate-loaded shoulder press and incline press. The shoulder press is at too much of an incline for my liking, but what is even worse is that pushing the weight moves it more like a guillotine press rather than a vertical press from the shoulder. The incline press also seemed like just an incline guillotine press as well, but this one is adjustable so maybe I just couldn't find the right setting this time around. 
- not the weight room itself, but the locker rooms only have like 4 rows for day use lockers??? Are we just going to have to wait for a locker at peak hours? lol
- women can't work out in just a sports bra anymore. I assume this also means men can't use cutoffs anymore either (this was the policy before renovations but never enforced) 


Overall though, I'm very happy with what they've done. Interested to hear what opinions other people have.

So I was riding my bike back from campus at around 5:40/6:00 PM down E street right next to the armadillo music parking lot across from Chipotle. There was a car driving next to/a  foot or so in front of me and pulled into the lot, not even turning on their blinker or looking to see if it was clear for them to take the turn. They ended up turning into me and I was knocked down. They stopped for a quick second, probably processing the fact that they had just hit someone, then as I tried standing up to talk to the passenger the car immediately sped off. A handful of people asked if I was ok/tried chasing after the them to get pictures of the plate but they all turned out blurry. 
The car was a 2014 (roughly) brownish-grey Honda CRV that now has a dent and scratch courtesy of my bike and body (lol) along its right side behind the door. I couldn’t see the driver, but the passenger was an Asian female with glasses. I know it’s a bit of a long shot but if anyone knows anything or has seen that car around town, I’d greatly appreciate any sort of information. Thanks!"

Here's mine!

I was heavy-set when I arrived at Davis, and I thought everyone knew it. Remembered coming into the dorms with extreme insecurity regarding my appearance, my double chin, my pillowy stomach. 

Then I saw the dining commons, and learned the concept of insecurity-driven portion control. After seeing the petite plates of food -- and observing that most people grabbed two plates at a time -- I found that I didn't want to look like a big glutton, so I began eating two plates of food every meal. I even cut out soda and juice, because water looked healthier.

This, compounded with the inherent stress of freshman year, cut my eating in half. Soon, I found myself eating twice a day: once after my first lecture, and once after my last class. There was no refrigerator in the dorm room, so accessing food constituted going outside and eating in a public setting. It was weird, I was insecure, I did it as little as possible.

So when I got around to buying a scale toward the end of Winter quarter, I saw 40 pounds missing from the number below me. And it was crazy. 

This was a wildly unusual way of losing weight, and I do not recommend it. However, it did change my life: I actually managed to claw my way out of prediabetes (diabetes runs in the family).

2 AM is the perfect time for reflection. 

Now someone wake me up in 7 hours, cuz I got a quiz in the morning.

TL;DR I was tubby McTubsters at the beginning freshman year, and through the sparkly, glittery magic of insecurity, I lost a good chunk of lbs and became a little healthier in the process."

Today marks the day that I've officially decided to leave my family in Washington for good. I was physically and mentally abused since a child, restricted from leaving the house, my location and every web page accessed tracked and used against me. What is the most frightening was that I was taught that living that life was okay, and that I deserved to be thrown in a closet for three months with little food and water to eat. I was taught to hate gays, Democrats.. anything that my father believed, I was forced to agree with. Or I'd be beaten, and once I was got ""too old"" for that, verbally and mentally abused.

When I started my freshman year here in 2018, I was still shackled. I went to my dorm room by no later than 7, didn't join any student organizations, spoke to my father everyday for hours and sent pictures of my outfits and my location to him, without question. Meanwhile, I had no friends, my grades began to suffer, and it wasn't until I was sexually assaulted and stalked by a student that I realized how traumatic my abuse was. I was victim-shamed, called a ""whore"".. told that I deserved whatever came to me, because ""you're just a controlling bitch with daddy-issues"".

This is where UC Davis comes in.

I see people on this subreddit complain about how no one is speaking to them, or how they don't have friends, and it baffles me how negative of an experience these people have. The moment I started to skip class and sleep in, I was emailed by my mentor, called by friends back home and on campus.. I was asked ""Is everything okay?"" by people who REALLY wanted to know if I was. There are over 32,000 students on this huge campus, and so many staff made time for little old me. I've finally been able to meet a psychiatrist for the first time in my life, my partner that I met here has encouraged me through the most, and even without a romantic relationship, I've met people who mean so much to me, both students and staff, in such a short amount of time.

So look around you at the beginning of this quarter. Don't be shy and say hi to someone who looks alone or distressed... You have no idea how much that one question will mean to them at that moment.

There is a pretty steep decline here so naturally people tend to speed up. I was about to pass this girl when she decides to turn left without any indication. My front wheel was about to approach her back wheel at this point, so I had to swerve to avoid t-boning her which led me on a direct path to the curb. At this point, I knew I was going too fast to stop, so I braced for impact and soft landed onto some grass. I was fine, just some dirt on my jeans, but she didn't even stop and say sorry (still salty).

I'm sure everyone knows you should signal before you make any turn, or at least I hope. You should also look over your shoulder and check your blind spot because you never know who might be right behind you. You wouldn't change lanes on the freeway without checking your blind spot, so why should biking be any different?

I'm a current member of the Davis Kinksters, a student and alumni ran community that has posted on this subreddit many times, asking for like-minded people who are interested in kink and sexual expression to come together, become educated, and have a safe space to come out of their shell. This is a throwaway, in order to ensure my safety, and also to make sure my words aren't used against me.

I'm going to tell you how I've realized that this community truly isn't as safe as they advertise it to be.

About a week or so ago, two of the administrators, who I am assuming were a couple, publicly stated in the server that they were leaving due to ""a security breach"". After speaking to several of the admin, I not only was hindered from knowing what kind of threat to our privacy was out there, but when I finally was told days later, I discovered just how scary it is to have an online platform for something so touchy as BDSM or sexuality.

A moderator's parent had somehow found about DK and had created a fake account and began taking screenshots of every conversation between several people within the chat rooms. For what purpose? I have no idea, but knowing that someone would be so willing to go through such great lengths to see what their now-adult child completely baffles me. Furthermore, the sudden change to the server after these two moderators left just showed even more how easy it was for a random person to just be able to walk in, see private NSFW content without being ID verified, and just leave.

I want to warn every student who may have heard of DK by a friend, or will see an ad from them in the future, to be very careful. It's possible that someone from their community may try to slander this post, but I don't want someone else to have their whole world turned upside down just like this innocent couple. I myself was really close to the couple when the server was first created, and I don't feel like any person on this planet should ever have what happens in their bedroom to be made public or known by their family.

Take care folks."

I checked out a lot of clubs and went to their meetings but there wasn’t anything that genuinely interested me and I didn’t want keep forcing myself to go when I didn’t even care about the club itself.

Since you are mostly undergrads here I just want to ask you a question.

Some background, my parents forced me to attend a four year university and threatened to withdraw their support (financially and emotionally) if I didn't go. I originally wanted to go to junior college because there is usually less social and academic pressure, but that wasn't an option for me at the time because of my mental health and I didn't think I could sustain a job to pay for my own housing (I was going to find another place to stay, but cc doesn't cover that because most people commute from home).

So I chose UC Davis because it offered the largest financial aid package and it was far enough from home to get away from my family. My relatives gave me tons of money because of my decision, and ever since then I have not made contact with my family and I projected that I have enough funds to survive without incurring any debt. However, I just feel like everybody is more happy here and making friends, but I'm really struggling to do that for some reason. I put in the effort to be really social and I work with partners in my classes, try out clubs, and talk to my professors, but it just doesn't feel that natural for me and I am not sure if going here was really the right path for me. My social life is lackluster and I have been trying to seek professional help for that recently.

At this point I don't think brute forcing interactions helps me anymore. I'm just wondering if people are happier to attend here because they actually chose to and their parents would support them no matter what school they went to."

Your subscription would tremendously help us out! We don't really know if people are going to find these sort of videos useful so your subscription would mean: YES, I think this could really help!

&amp;#x200B;

The lectures were just the professor reading every single word from the slides - and I really mean every single word including the smallest details in the examples that are not so relevant to the concepts. What's worse is the grading. Grading for assignments and exams was ridiculously slow to the extent that students started to feel TAs simply don't care about it at all: the grade for the assignment from week 3 didn't get released until the day before the final exam, and the grades for the other assignments were just released a few days ago. The overall course structure is unorganized and lacks emphasis. There are way too many concepts that are trying to be packed into this course, and as a result, every single one of them is only discussed briefly. Assignments consisted of a few of the simplest models (N-grams, p-CFG, Naive Bayes) and excluded the state-of-the-art methods, such as recurrent and fully connected neural network, which are probably the reasons that many students wanted to take this course originally.

&amp;#x200B;

And no, I didn't write this because I got a low grade. There are courses that I would totally take again even though I got the a low grade because of how much the course taught me, but ECS 189G NLP is not one of them. I got an A- in the end, and I think many other students also got relatively high grades because of the curve, but I still would've avoided this course at any cost if I knew. I believe this course was really a waste of time and effort as many students and I find the current unorganized structures of the course discouraged us to have a meaningful understanding of the materials. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do know that this is a new course and really do believe it will improve throughout the years, but as the pathetic whiny undergraduate, I just want to rant.

One student even called the building owner and said “Um, your apartment is on fire” lol. The fire was quickly spreading through the bushes, and due to the layout of the apartment, going through the bushes was the only way for those residents to evacuate. But after about 30 seconds someone found a fire extinguisher and ran up and put it out. If the rest of the bushes had caught on fire, the residents would have had nowhere to go. By the time the UC Davis FD got there 2 minutes later, all the nearby residents were evacuated and the fire was out.

We have a tent cabin in Half Dome Village reserved for the duration of that week which has two single beds and one double bed, and we are looking for two more people to join us.  

We have two friends that may be interested but they are very likely to cancel so we’re looking to see if some of you folks will be interested in joining us and help splitting the cost. Total cost per night is 160$ split evenly between occupants of the tent cabin. We would prefer a couple, so they could share the double bed, and that way cost per person per night will be $40. But anyone else is also welcome. We are LGBTQ+ friendly. 

As an added benefit, we’re bringing a car and would be happy to give you a ride. And it would be neat if we could make some new friends too. 

Please let me know if you’re interested. Feel free to DM me, then we will exchange personal information/social media etc to make sure each other is trustworthy, obviously. An empty double bed in half dome village during summer season is definitely a huge waste. Let’s make a Pareto improvement on our welfare."

And when there's a large crowd of pedestrians trying to cross, you cannot speak on behalf of everybody. A pedestrian who didn't see you gesture a car through may try to cross.

I suppose if you and the vehicle are the only ones at the intersection, it's no big deal. But when there's lots of activity going on, you cannot predict what everyone involved will do.

I remember, during regular session, a large crowd trying cross at Kleiber when a car approached. One dude just unilaterally decided to wave the car through. The driver rightfully refused. Like, literally a fraction of a second later, a cyclist came from behind the crowd and zoomed across. The cyclist could not have possibly seen what the guy was doing through the crowd.

Right-of-way is more important than politeness. If you have the right-of-way but worry you weren't seen, just pause a little and visually confirm that they see you (and stop for you) before crossing."

Yesterday I was eating lunch at the MU. Got my lunch and went to the outdoor tables. The nearest table had one girl sitting at it, do I asked if I could sit and she said it was fine. So, I sit, eat my lunch (with a quick napkin run in the middle), and then head to compost the plate and wash my hands. I enter the bathroom and head to the sink to wash my hands, and another guy does the same next to me. A few seconds in, he turns to me and asks ""Did you know her?"". By this point I was already thinking about my plans from now and had no clue what he was asking, so after I asked for supervision, he said ""The girl you ate lunch with"". I, still caught off guard, responded with a ""..No?"". The guy preceded to turn around and walk out of the bathroom, and I couldn't find him after. 

So my concern here is that he was stalking the girl, and I really didn't know what to do in that situation. I looked for the girl after that with the thought that I might warm her, but she was gone by the time I checked. I also don't know if I should have, as a guy I understand me warning her would have been creepy on my part, and also terrifying. My wife agreed, but said she would have warned her is she was there, as she's not a guy. 

Anyway, partially looking for opinions, partially general warning, and partially hope that girl sees this post. If you think it might be you, pm or comment and I can give more details to confirm. 

Stay safe people, don't be creepy."
cxtbkq,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/cxtbkq/to_freshmantransfers_wondering_if_your_schedule/,To freshman/transfers wondering if your schedule is too difficult,66,6,2019-08-31 00:52:15,"I’ve been seeing a lot of posts asking about this. Good news: you can drop classes! Almost every quarter I sign up for too many classes and drop the one I dislike the most after instruction starts. The minimum amount of units you can take is 12 (you have to average 13 over 3 quarters) and it’s totally fine to start off with that many units. My first year quarters I took 12, 14, and 16 units. My second year I took 17, 13, and 12 (had to go lower bc of health problems.)

Classes have either a 10 day or 20 day drop period, which means that you can drop a class by the 10th or 20th day OF THE CLASS, and you’ll get an email warning you about the drop date before it comes up. 

Also! I see people worrying that their schedule is going to be too hard because they have too many major requirements compared to GEs. I saw a really good comment the other day that said GEs aren’t always easy; they’re someone else’s major requirements! I wouldn’t worry about the proportion. And again... you can drop your hardest class if you need to, if you’re taking enough units! If it’s offered again later in the year you can try again when you’re more used to campus life, so you don’t have to stress about both moving somewhere new and a difficult class. 

Best of luck to those coming to Davis for the first time! It’s so funny to me how the subreddit is so completely different during the year and the summer. It’s fun seeing so many people excited to come."

Details in post.",43,4,2019-08-05 12:42:12,"Hello guys, I hit kind of a wall here.... Hence why I am looking for a roommate this late.

I am a soon-to-be third year living in North Davis. To be exact, I am living in 880 Alvarado Avenue AKA La Salle Apartments. 

They have really nice amenities including a swimming pool, study lounge and a gym. It is a pretty decent spot with easy access to the bus stop and a 3 minute walk to Safeway. I really recommend you checking out their website and possibly even visiting it. PM me if you are interested and I will let my housemates know that you are visiting. They will give you an overview of the place. 

I lived there for a year with my friends. The 5 of us lived in the ""two bedroom with bonus open loft"" and still do. 

https://www.lasalleapts.com/davis/la-salle-apartments/floorplans/two-bedroom-with-bonus-open-loft-169028/is-premium-view/1/

The two bedrooms on the first floor are doubles and the bedroom on the second floor is a single. 

This year, we were planning to have one more person move in to make it 6. However things went south really quick. 

Recently my roommate told me that he has to move out to live with his uncle in Sacramento. I don't know the details but I am sure he has his own set of reasons. Also, the person who was planning to move in was dismissed from Davis... 

This basically made us into 4, and now we have to look for a roommate asap. The office thankfully postponed our payment by 2 weeks so we still have a bit of time. 

The reason why we are looking for men only is because one girl decided to move into the single and already bought the furniture to go in it. At this point it will be unfair to have her move into the double. 

We are a pretty multicultural house with two Korean guys (including me), a Chinese guy and an American girl. We are all friends with each other so we are pretty tight and hang out together pretty often. Don't be afraid, we will be more than happy to have you hang out with us!

If you are interested in any way, you will be moving into the smaller double on the first floor. This room is pretty small. It is a 9x12 shared with two people. There is a twin sized bunk bed and you will be taking the top bunk. All you need is a desk and a dresser.

Your roommate will be me! Hello to you all who are interested. To briefly introduce myself, I am a Korean international who likes chill and laid back environments. I may not be the most active person on the planet, but I am keen on hanging out with people I like. I like generally ""nerdy"" things like tech and videogames but I also like sports and music. 

The rent will be $480 a month. We don't split the rent evenly due to the differences in room size and we calculated the rent split mathematically so we all believe it is a pretty fair split. The room you will be living is pretty small so the rent will be lower than the other members of the house. 

I hope you found this post to be intriguing. I am looking forward to meeting those who are interested."

Well, my friend just texted me a few minutes ago saying that her froyo tasted off, so she looked for the expiration date and found that it was already expired... Since March. I hadn't tried mine yet, so I looked at mine. It expired in fucking JANUARY. If they had expired earlier this month I wouldn't think it was that big of a deal, but dude.

It was a cold rainy day on February 13, 2006 in a portable building at the UC Davis College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences and I was 22 years old. It was my first day of work and I was sitting in a leaking, stale-smelling, cobwebbed covered room.  

I found a photo, logged in the back of a deep drawer and have kept this photo in my wallet since that very first day of work. The photo, known as 'Frog Lady', has haunted me - but the inscription has intrigued me beyond belief.  

If you recognize this woman, please let me know. She was either an undergrad student, graduate student, postdoctoral student or faculty member at UC Davis and most likely in the College of Ag, during the mid-1970s. 

In the posed photo, she is wearing three frogs - which represent 'Hear No Evil' 'See No Evil' 'Speak No Evil'. The inscription reads: ""December 22, 1976  The day I parted with the frogs...and you. Not good of me, not bad of the frogs the slide is better.""

Yes, it’s a big school, and it’s easy to get lost. You’re in a new place and nobody knows your name, or you’ve been here but things have changed. You try to connect, but you don’t feel it. 

You are engaged in a difficult fight. You fight a concept that has the power to end relationships, careers, and lives. It causes hatred, addiction, and despair. It is abstract and pervasive.

You fight the shadow, loneliness.

No matter what stage of the process you’re at, there is work to be done. I know when I get lonely, 80% of the time it’s just the voice in my head telling me shitty things. It’s pretty persuasive. 

But that doesn’t mean it’s right. It’s your head. You decide what is real and what is not.

Connection is hard, yes. But there are other lonely people out there. The forces that have hijacked your brain to make you think you can’t connect are out there infecting other people too. This is depression and anxiety, this is phone and screen addiction, this is school and work stress. These are the forces of division that keep us isolated and isolating.

It’s your job to find someone who is even lonelier than you.

They are not easy to find, and harder still to bring together. And you will have to bring your A-game to persist, as the loneliness will try to corrupt you and shackle itself to you until you give up, even more defeated for having tried. 

Remember, your enemy is defeated by teamwork and teamwork alone. All successes are earned; all failures, practice.

You know the suggestions; talk to classmates, join a club, organize an event. Do these and more.

It is more important, though, that you do anything at all. This way, you won’t be alone: you’ll have you on your side. 

You will succeed, eventually. I promise. At the very least, a fellow lonely person may see your efforts and be inspired to endure for another day, and that day may make all the difference. You have not been spared to venom fangs of loneliness, but you can help others still.

Go forth, lonely Aggies, and find each other."

**Giveaways:** Students are receiving free T-shirts and cowbells. Don't be surprised if you don't get your shirt right away -- it's bad form to just grab it and leave and so sometimes they put the giveaway later in the game to prevent that.

In the many discussions in this sub regarding the pro-freedom protests in Hong Kong, I’ve observed several recurring themes, talking points, and strategies by commenters and posters who have taken a stance in favor of mainland China’s authoritarian government (hereafter, the “CPC” for ""Communist Party of China""). Below is a brief summary of these rhetorical observations, along with brief rebuttals.

For background and reference, the protestors in Hong Kong have five demands and objectives. The first, “the complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process,” involves the main precipitating event of the protests, which is a proposed bill that would remove the limited due process that is currently protected in Hong Kong by exposing Hong Citizens to direct political persecution in mainland China. The last, “the resignation of Carrie Lam and the implementation of universal suffrage for Legislative Council and Chief Executive elections,” would ensure a degree of democratic self-governance in Hong Kong while remaining part of China. The remaining three, “the retraction of the ‘riot’ characterization,” “the release and exoneration of arrested protesters,” and “the establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests” are meant to address the ongoing brutal attempt by the government to suppress and discredit the protestors.

For China’s part, democratization in Hong Kong presents an existential threat to their regime. Historically, nothing destabilizes an authoritarian regime more consistently than bordering a democracy. It’s hard for subjects to accept authoritarianism and oppression when free people live on the other side of an imaginary line. China is currently separated from its closest democracies by seas, mountains, and buffer states. The prospect of a free democratic Hong Kong bordering the Chinese mainland has motivated a strong and violent response against the protestors by the Chinese government, even in the face of international condemnation.

Below, I’ve catalogued nine of the recurring themes, talking points, and strategies in pro-CPC propaganda on this sub. Even this post, which ended up being longer than I expected, captures neither the true breadth of the problem nor the depth to which some users have bought into China’s propaganda. A deeper rhetorical analysis would require more space than this post can afford and more time than I have to offer. For starters, I made the decision not to directly quote any specific user spreading propaganda, partially because I don’t want to call out anyone in particular or encourage brigading, although I recognize the lack of direct quotes may weaken my generalizations of those users’ arguments. I also don’t provide supporting evidence for my claims of extensive police brutality—which will likely be noted by those commenters who favor the Chinese government—because the main purpose of this writeup is to discuss the rhetoric on this sub, while I assume by now we’re all too familiar with the plight of the protestors.

&amp;#x200B;

**Using the term “Brainwashing”**

The first and perhaps most clever recurring theme in the pro-CPC posts is the use of the term “brainwashing.” Why would pro-CPC Redditors use this term so consistently? “Brainwashing” is a term that evokes a cartoonish image of people getting hypnotized by pocket watches. The term is meant to immediately denigrate any discussion of China’s extensive and pervasive propaganda campaign. Joking about the term “brainwashing” is also a great way to endear oneself to the audience. But, as we have seen, while the pro-CPC commenters in our sub aren’t brainwashed with swirly eyes, they have bought into much of the Chinese government’s propaganda and are parroting it here.

Pro-CPC commenters using this strategy will say things like, “We’re not brainwashed, we want to hear both sides of the issue” or “I’m just a scary brainwashed foreign student here to answer your questions lol.” Notice that these kinds of phrases make any following discussion of propaganda seem silly while also making the pro-CPC commenters seem reasonable and even funny.

While we’re on the topic of manipulative terminology, it’s worth noting that there are far less clever but equally purposeful attempts to control the narrative through specific terms. The most notable, of course, is to refer to the protests and protestors as “riots” and “rioters.” Other tactics, like using “western values” instead of “human rights” or using “China” and “Chinese people” instead of “the Chinese government” get their own sections below. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Cultivating Apathy**

When people think of the term “propaganda” they often imagine an authoritarian government trying to make their people believe incorrect or even impossible things, like that time that North Korea told its subjects that it found an ancient unicorn lair. The most effective and insidious propaganda isn’t a spread of lies, but a spread of apathy. Getting people to believe your lies is hard, but getting people to stop caring is an easy and effective way to control people. In short, authoritarian governments usually try to get their people to believe that their own beliefs and actions don’t matter, because the outcome will be the same regardless of any action they might take or opinion they might hold.

This strategy has been very noticeable among the pro-CPC posts in this sub. When confronted about their opinions of the Hong Kong protestors’ demands, the response is usually something like, “I don’t care either way, because they’re not going to get their demands met anyway.” Then, having dodged the question about content of protestors’ demands, they can move onto the other recurring themes and talking points of the propaganda.

&amp;#x200B;

**Twisting Hong Kong’s fight for freedom into a persecution of Chinese people**

The protests in Hong Kong are a conflict between the people of Hong Kong and an oppressive authoritarian government. The outcome of the conflict will determine the fate of human rights for millions of people living in Hong Kong and their descendants.

The authoritarian versus freedom fighter nature of the conflict puts the Chinese government in a bad light, obviously. So what is the best way for the government to spin the conflict in its own favor? The answer is to recast the conflict as an imposition of western values on the Chinese people, thus making the discussion one about cultural colonization, racism, and the preservation of Chinese values.

We see this in our subreddit whenever those defending the Chinese government attempt to frame the goals of the Hong Kong protests as “western” or suggest that democracy or human rights in general are somehow incompatible with Chinese values. This ignores that both democracy and a respect for human rights have been successful in a wide variety of cultures throughout the world. This is not only true in Asia in general (see India, the world’s largest democracy) and East Asia specifically (see Japan and South Korea), but even in an actual country populated by Chinese people (see Taiwan, which even if you don’t want to call it a country, is at the very least a functionally independent Chinese island democratically governed by its own people). Democracy has been successful in such a wide variety of countries because the core tenents of democracy—that people should control and be protected from their own government—is not incompatible with any culture, it’s merely incompatible with authoritarian political interests.

Don’t let the rhetoric distract you from the fact that this fight is one between the Chinese people and the Chinese government over their human rights. Siding with the people against their government doesn’t make you a westerner, it just makes you right.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conflating the merits of their opinion with their right to have an opinion**

In the specific case here at UC Davis of pro-CPC students holding their own counter-rallies, we see one of the oldest talking points of those who would use freedom of speech against itself. Several times, we have seen commenters say that they just want to have their own rally and table to share their own views of the Hong Kong protestors. How can you be against the pro-CPC rally if you support the freedoms of speech and assembly?

Those who have lived their lives in oppression might think this is a clever or even profound argument, but those who have lived in the free world are more than familiar with this fallacy by now. It’s the same question every time, always in a new wrapper. “How can you be against Nazi’s marching down your streets yet call yourself a defender of freedom?” or “How can you criticize that person’s remarks? Even if they’re sexist, what about their freedom of speech?”

The answer, of course, is not that we’re against anyone expressing him/her/their-self. If you want to spend your time in a free country to speak out against freedom, then go ahead. But respecting your right to speak doesn’t mean that we have to like your message or respect you for sharing that message. Nor does it mean that we can’t or won’t meet your speech with our own. Freedom to speak is not a mandate to be heard.

&amp;#x200B;

**Refusal to engage with the content of the protestors’ message**

&amp;

**Focusing on the protestors’ symbols rather than the protestors’ message**

I believe that most common strategy of Pro-CPC commenters is their refusal to directly engage the substance of the Hong Kong protestors’ message and demands. Every attempt to solicit a response regarding the five demands of the Hong Kong protestors are ignored or met with quick deflection. This is not surprising, because the demands are far too reasonable to attack directly, leaving deflection as an obvious strategy.

Many of these deflections are to other talking points discussed elsewhere in this post. Here, however, I want to discuss one specific form of deflection—the focus on symbols rather than message. Shifting the discussion to symbols from messages is an incredibly effective strategy when backed into a corner; I’m sure we all employ it from time to time. Symbols are powerful, yet easy to take out of context and easy to assign one’s own meaning. But let’s humor the pro-CPC commenters for a moment and take a look at the actual symbolic arguments they’ve made to distract from the substantive arguments against their government.

For those who don’t know, the UK returned control of Hong Kong to China in 1997, ending over 100 years of foreign rule of the city. Many in Hong Kong feared that the turnover would end many legal protections of their rights that existed under colonial government but which were not protected in China. As these fears have turned out to be very justified, some protestors have turned to the colonial flag of Hong Kong as a message to Chinese and local governments that they and their rights were stronger under foreign occupation than they are now under domestic rule.

Pro-CPC propaganda, however, has seized upon the protestors’ use of the old colonial flag to claim that the protestors are secretly intent on independence or-quite ridiculously-upon return to British colonial rule. This allows the Chinese government to shift the conversation to the preservation of the Chinese state instead of focusing on the actual demands of the protestors, which are quite limited in scope. Don’t let them deflect to symbols; keep the focus on substance.

&amp;#x200B;

**Dehumanization of persecuted groups, namely Uyghurs in China**

When confronted about the extensive state violence against the Uyghur population, keep an eye out for two key responses. First, of course, is deflection and minimization (e.g. “I haven’t heard that much about it, but I don’t think it’s as bad as the media makes it sound"" followed by a subject change). The second is the oldest trick in the book for oppressing minorities: dehumanization. This second point seems to have a lot of buy-in from Chinese commenters, which isn’t surprising because people everywhere have always been eager to buy into any narrative that presents different people as inferior.

In the case of Uyghurs, look for commenters portraying them as especially violent (e.g. “the government had to ban knives where Uyghurs live because they keep trying to stab each other”). This, in turn, builds into a narrative that any state action against the Uyghur population (which, they insist, is minimal) is necessary for the Uyghur’s own good and for the protection of the rest of China. If these themes sound familiar, they should. We’ve seen it many times before, at home and abroad. States don’t persecute minorities for their own good, they do it because the minority group is in the way.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cherry-picking, Exaggerating, Hypocrisy, and False Equivalence**

The hypocrisy and cherry-picking of the pro-CPC commenters deserve their own post, because there is a lot to unpack. In this one section, I want to briefly highlight what to look for.  

All messages, politics, and symbols aside, there are two indisputable truths about the Hong Kong protests. Firstly, the protestors have been extraordinarily peaceful. Even if the very limited but very repeated allegations of violence by the protestors were true, the violent crime rate among the protestors is much lower than a given city of equivalent size. Do the propagandists really not think that a protest of well over a million people wouldn’t have any bad actors? Or are they hoping that we’re that stupid? If anyone tries to convince you that the protestors have been anything other than restrained and peaceful, especially given the circumstances, don’t give them an inch of respect, because they aren’t giving you any.

Secondly, the violence perpetrated by the state against their people in Hong Kong is extraordinarily excessive and atrocious. This is not the actions of a few bad actors within the police force; it is a coordinated and widespread effort by the state to violently quell, intimidate, and suppress their people. Do not let them convince you that both sides are at fault. One side is marching for their freedom, the other is attacking the people.

&amp;#x200B;

**Imposing their own Rules, Ignoring History**

Above, I noted that the propagandists will highlight even the most isolated incident of violence by the protestors as evidence that the protests are generally violent. I also noted that the propagandists try to frame the protests as a secret succession movement. But while it’s abundantly clear that both accusations are patently false, I ask, “why would it matter if the protests were violent riots for independence?”

The propagandists have tried to establish a premise in the debate that all violent protest and all calls for independence would delegitimize the protests at large. But have they forgotten American history or have they also forgotten their own? Weren’t the origins of current US and Chinese states built upon violent uprisings against the incumbent governments? Furthermore, aren’t these revolutions seen as morally justified in their current respective countries? Violence in popular uprisings doesn’t invalidate the uprising or, if it does, then both the United States and China are both built upon illegitimate foundations. In short, the propagandists have been so busy trying to trick us into thinking the Hong Kong protests are violent, they haven’t actually made a case for why they shouldn’t be violent. They are, after all, fighting for their freedom.  So if someone tells you that the Hong Kong protests are too violent, tell them that means China should surrender itself to Taiwan, the last remnant of the government mainland China violently overthrew 70 years ago.

The case of commenters discrediting the protests as a secret independence movement is a somewhat hilarious example of propaganda meant for a Chinese audience finding itself in the wrong forum. This talking point is meant to pander to a common and strong desire in the Chinese population for a unified country, by evoking the specter of succession. This obviously doesn’t land too well in the United States, which was built around the idea that violent succession is justified and necessary in the pursuit freedom, liberty, and democracy. So, as a tip to the pro-CPC commenters, maybe avoid talking points that make the American readers associate the Hong Kong revolutionaries with our founding fathers.

&amp;#x200B;

**Justifying human rights abuses by China’s economic growth**

One final common pro-Chinese government talking point is that the numerous, large, and ongoing human human rights violations throughout China are justified by China’s economic growth over the past few decades. Let’s breeze past how morally repugnant that argument is, because if you think that’s a legitimate justification, no internet rant is going to save you. Instead, let’s take a look at the causal claim that China’s growth is due to its humanitarian atrocities. I argue that with proper perspective, China’s growth has, at best, happened despite its authoritarian government and, at worst, has been greatly delayed by its authoritarianism.

Authoritarianism in general is strongly associated with lower economic growth, although the causal relationship between government type and economic performance is not entirely understood. China is the exception to the poor economic performance of totalitarian government. And even then, controlling for its large population, it’s not an impressive exception with a GDP per capita roughly equivalent to Mexico.

China is the largest country in the world by far, controls resource-rich territory, and has had its current regime for 70 years. The fact that they are now the second largest economy in the world isn’t surprising. The question isn’t why it’s doing well now; the question is why it took so long to catch up. Apologists for the CPC might say that China simply started with next to nothing 70 years ago following the Japanese occupation. Nonetheless, the numbers speak for themselves. Of the other top-ten economies, almost all were devastated by World War Two, yet they managed rebound faster and stronger than China with just a fraction of the population and without committing crimes against humanity. And if we’re talking about growth rate, sure it’s high, but it’s easy to grow a lot when your baseline is so low.  China’s government, policies, and actions have delayed their inevitable economic growth by decades.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR**

Stand up for your fellow humans and their humanity.  We're not fighting in the streets alongside the protestors, but the very least we can do is confront those who would twist the dialog against those fighting for their most basic freedoms."

I had the most fantastic experience and that may just be because therapy was something new for me. I REALLY needed someone to listen to me, and sometimes I needed that someone to not be a friend/family member.

 In the recent days **Davis4HK** has received harsh treatment for our  involvement in the Free Hong Kong movement on campus. It recently  escalated to the point where **Chinese Students and Scholars Association  (CSSA)** at UC Davis put out a statement saying they had reported us to  the **San Francisco Chinese Consulate (SFCC)**. 

This is another attempt to disseminate fear: 

* What are the consequences of our movement being  reported to the SFCC? 
* Will we, UC Davis students, be personally  targeted now that the SFCC has become involved? 

**These questions are just  the beginning on the implications this could have on our campus.**

 Please help us by signing this letter to help protect our UC Davis  students exercising their right to freedom of speech on campus! We will  not be intimidated!

**The goal of this event** is to provide an open forum and easy opportunity for us, who are feeling a bit lonely, to make some new friends.

It's okay to approach at your own pace, no one will force you; we're happy you're here.  
**Remember:** We're here to make friends, it's wise to avoid hot topics. We all come from different backgrounds and hold different perspectives, they're all valid, let's respect that. Let's be a positive and welcoming environment.

**WHERE/WHEN UPDATE:**   
***When***: 4pm, Sunday, October 20th. After looking through all the comments on the original post I saw that Sunday late-afternoon would be a more fitting time.   
***Where***: E-Street Plaza. Due to so much interest we are moving the meetup spot to the E-Street Plaza. This location is very public/open and will allow us to make plans by ear and find what can accommodate us best. E-Street Plaza is in downtown Davis and has Baskin-Robins, Taqueria El Burrito, and is across from De'Veres Irish Pub.

If you rip off others’ posters, censor others’ opinion, or make verbal attack because of your feeling, you’re retarded. 


Hey y’all. I’m that mainland student again who did an AMA. You can look into my post history where I believe it shows that Im in a quite neutral position regarding the HK movement, and I think my experience as someone from mainland can give you an indepth view of the side that you don’t usually see — the side of mainland Chinese students. The majority of mainland Chinese students do not support and are against the movenment in HK for two main reasons to my knowledge, and I will go over each one of them and explain why they see it that way. 

1. They believe HK protest is a violent separatist movement that’s trying to make HK an indepedent country.

They view it this way mainly due to how the protests are displayed by the state media. The state medias show footage of police and mainland Chinese getting beaten up by masked protesters, pictures of protesters waving British national flags, videos of protesters damaging the public properties, and more. Did these things really happen? Likely yes. Did they do it just because they are violent thugs? Probably no. Do they make up the majority of the protesters? Likely no. However, the state medias use this footages to paint the protest to be about HK independence and mentions nothing about the five demands. Many of you asked in the AMA why HK independence is a bad thing and why it angers mainland Chinese so much. HK independence is a highly sensitive topic due to two things. First, it is just not possible in anyway. HK has no military of its own, is in the middle of mainland China, and has its infrastructures, such as power plants and water reservoirs, are all in mainland.  Second, it’s due to history of HK. HK was a colony leased to the British in 1800s, and the lease has always to be seen as a shame over the entire Chinese race because it shows how weak Chinese were and how Chinese were treated like slaves that would just give out their territory for opium. Fortunately for people in HK, British brought in a western democratic system, trades, and modern technology, which improved the economy by a sustantial degree. This sounds pretty positive, but it leads to the next reason that mainland Chinese dislikes the movement.

2. Many mainland Chinese believe HKers see them as an inferior race.

Under British rule, HK exceeded PRC (People’s Republic of China, aka mainland China) economically by a huge amount with its GDP being higher than PRC for decades. Because of this, many mainland Chinese immigrated to HK, and as what usually happens during a period that had a lot of immigration, discrimination and xnophobia happens. Mainland immigrants were given derogatory terms, such as “阿燦”, “大陸哩”, “大陸仔”, “支那人”, etc (you have to google them since each one has a history). Later during the infamous Chinese Milk Scandal, many mainlanders went to HK to buy milk powder for their children because they lost trust in Chinese brands. They bought so much that many HKers couldn’t even buy for their own because they were OOS. This brought mainland Chinese a new derogotary term, “locusts.” And of course, the state media reported all of this to the mainland Chinese to show them how HKers see them as inferior. 

(Below is a personal experience that I first hesitated to include because I could be biased due to many factors, but i tried my best to write it as close to what happened as possible. Sample size of encounters is not large either where N ≈ 15)

When I went to HK over several ocasions,  i found some really consistant patterns of how people treated me. I do not speak Cantonese, so I have to use Mandarin or English. Although HKers dont speak mandarin, they use very similar written language as mainland (traditional vs simplified Chinese). Because of this, I would type out things in traditional Chinese and show it to then. All of the questions pretty mich started with “hi, sorry for bothering. I’m from mainland and can’t speak Cantonese. Can you show me how to ...”. With this method, people most of the time responded in a really cold manner without any facial expression. I was just thinking maybe it was just that HK is a busy city and everyone is in a hurry until I started asking questions in English. Whenever I asked in English, people tend to smile a lot and respond my questions patiently. I am not the only one who have had this experience and was surprised when one of my friends bought up experience of his in a conversation where he found this pattern, too. Was it due to xenophobia or the bad stereotypical image of mainland tourists? Maybe. Was it just due to HKers feel more comfortable with English than mandarin? Perhaps. But one thing for sure was that I felt uncomfortable with identifying myself as someone from mainland and many people in China see this as discrimination.


Because of these, many mainland Chinese have a very biased view on anything that HKers do. Even if they did know the five demands, it would still be difficult to make them support the movements because of this nationalism and ethnicity related bias."

It may be normal that after graduating you miss it which is the case for me. But I’m now 2+ years removed and I still miss the area like crazy. Idk if anyone feels like this but I miss the small city feeling, the bikes, the food, etc. Maybe I still miss it a lot because I have not found like a set job like others have and I still have plans to get my masters.

I was in Sacramento earlier this year for 4 months doing an internship. I definitely took advantage of my time there and got an ARC membership so I would go every day to workout and play. Then seeing how some people from my years still go play or were in the area was great. Obviously it is not the same since there are new faces but it was still a great feeling being up there  enjoying Sac and Davis, eating at my fav spots etc.

Since graduating I’ve worked in San Antonio for a year (which I really liked) and had to move back to LA after a year (it was an americorps position in San Antonio). I am from and grew up in LA and I hate it here because it is just too packed and expensive and I think what I really liked about Sac/Davis was that it was way less of that there. After struggling for months finding something when I moved back to LA I got that internship in Sac which I loved doing and learned so much which was immigration, specifically citizenship.  after my internship was over I got an immigration position in LA and I love the work. But again too much traffic and all. I definitely enjoyed and needed those 4 months in Sac/Davis because I missed it like crazy

I still miss it like crazy and I hope to (if I stay in California) live in that area if there are immigration position open in non profits, schools, etc in the near future or after I get my masters in a few years.

I know we all have different experiences at Davis but for those who are enjoying it currently, keep enjoying it! It is a great small city with a small kinda town feeling to it. The food is great. It is beautiful there. I will always have fond memories of that place. Good luck Aggies

Walk in five minutes before the lecture starts, and I see that only three of the four seats she usually saves are occupied, the only unoccupied one being on the edge.

I notice her staring at me, but I pretend like I don't notice. A couple minutes pass and she's switching between whispering to her friends about what to do with me and staring at me. I take out one of my headphones and say, ""Can I help you?""
She responds, ""No, sorry, I thought you were someone else."" And stops staring. Her friend eventually arrives (late) and walks to the second row only to find me in his usual spot. He looks a bit confused and betrayed, then turns around to find a seat somewhere else. 

Even though it was 8am, it felt so damn good to fuck up the routine of these entitled bastards. Hopefully I can do it again on Monday."

Why is TAPS literally going the opposite direction of all the other colleges?

Try not to stay out too late, and if you’re getting home late, let a roommate or friend know. Tell them that if they don’t hear from you in X amount of time to call the cops. Allow each other to each other’s location. 

Don’t carry valuables at night. Leave your wallet in your room. Don’t carry your laptop in your bag if you’re coming home late (which is hard bc were all students) but if they ask you to hand you all your belongings, at least you won’t be a few thousand dollars short. 

Get some pepper spray. It will at least give you a few seconds head-start to run away. VSCO girls carry your huge ass hydro-flask so you can use that to hit someone if you need to. 

Don’t stay in your car after you park. Get the fuck out of your car and hightail it to your apartment. Leave the porch lights on. Ask your neighbors to do so too, that way the street will be more well-lit.

I get that it's an individual choice (etc., etc.), but is it not longer reasonable to expect seat ""saving"" to be respected? We should get to the bottom of this, because this feels like a cultural shift to me.

Hey all. I’m possibly not going to be able to pay for my third payment plan due on November 15th. Because of the brand new payroll system with UCPath, my paychecks have been lost and slower than usual (had paper paychecks and finally switching to direct deposit).

I’m working 20 hour weeks and I’m taking 17 units on top of that. I’ve tried to explain my situation to the financial aid office, and they’ve brushed me off numerous times saying that there are no exceptions. 

I don’t know how to feel because I’m just so exhausted. I work my ass off, yet I haven’t seen any of it in my mail.

Academically, I can barely handle the minimum unit requirement. The mindset in lecture halls feels like a ""don't ask a question unless you know you're right"" one. Along these same lines, ive found students in my major (ANS) to be competitive to a point of pushing me down mentally to step ahead. I don't feel comfortable stating that I don't know an answer anymore. All of my discussion TA's for general classes (chem, bis, ect) are international male students who can't explain things very well, and it gets frustrating very quickly (To no fault of their own, I know they are trying). I  hate the learning mindset this school has, which often doesn't leave room for mistakes and as soon as you get behind there's no returning to your original pace.

I'm depressed and The SHWC doesn't even have enough therapists to see all of us, they're booked out -2 weeks. The online resource crisis line is literally scripted and didn't help at all ""did I help you move from a 'hot moment' to a 'cool calm' today?"" (Yes, that's a quote. The whole conversation went like this). All I needed was human connection and guidance earlier than the two week waiting period they offered.

Davis is accepting more students than it can handle and it's causing issues across the board, from mental health, class impactions, and housing space. 

I don't know how you upper-grads handle this but ive just been smoking weed to manage my anxiety and depression and it's obviously not helping. (no need to lecture there, it's a short term gratifying solution, I know) I don't know what to do, I feel alone, uncared for, uncomfortable, and destined to fail. 
I regret choosing Davis and wish I had gone to CC. I think I just can't handle the pace of this school, and maybe it's just a me problem. I feel it's too late to back out or even transfer to another UC now, I'm in my second year and don't know what my options are until after break because it was the soonest appointment I could get with an academic counselor.

I'm a little concerned about financing. I've gone over the expenses with my landlord, and this apartment isn't as cheap as I'd like it to be (~$1300 a month w/utilities) its still much cheaper than housing through SHA (varies, $4100-$6000 depending on quarter), and it guarantees summer housing.

I do receive a little bit of financial aid which covers most tuition and I've had to take out loans just for housing. Someone told me that financial aid is reduced quite a bit if you live off campus. My landlord assured me that even if my financial aid is reduced, I will likely be spending less money per quarter. If I was spending less than $1000 a month this would make more sense to me, but I'm very uncertain with how much I'll be paying.

I have until tomorrow to submit an application for this apartment, and less than a week to back out SHA.

Any suggestions?

I'm also a little worried about paying rent over the summer. Im hoping I won't have to repeat classes over the summer (there is a possibility for one class) but I would like to stay and do my senior project so I wouldn't have to wait to do it in the Fall, when I'd have classes. My grandma is offering to let me stay those months, but it's like $40 a day for transportation and a 3-4 hour commute.

I normally wipe down faucets, doorknobs, light switches, and other shared surfaces with sanitizing wipes. I also never touch those surfaces directly with my hands (elbow, forearm to turn on lights, sleeves over hands to open doors...). 
I get super anxious just thinking about sharing a bathroom and kitchen with 2 other not-so-clean people that aren’t my mom. Does anyone have any other tips on keeping my germs to myself? 

These are some things I normally do anyways that might be helpful to others:

-no sharing towels 

-hovering over the toilet seat lmao (I’m paranoid af)

-closing the toilet seat when I flush so bacteria doesn’t go everywhere

-hiding my dishes and utensils so they don’t use them at all

-no sharing food

-keeping my own personal roll of TP that no one else touches

-washing my hands compulsively (they’re so dry :( ), not touching my face...

I hope everyone is staying safe and sane preparing for this upcoming quarter!"

If you can’t already tell from the title, I was waitlisted for biotech at UC Davis. I was pretty disappointed since Davis is my top choice. I understand that there isn’t a definitive way to determine the chances of getting off the waitlist considering that it ultimately depends on how many people accept their position on the waitlist in the first place. However, I’ve taken a look at the waitlist stats for 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 freshman application cycle and around a third (~3000) of all people offered a waitlist for Davis accepted it. The big difference between those two application cycles is that around 2/3 of those who accepted their waitlist offer in 2017-2018 were ultimately accepted whereas only 24 people who accepted their waitlist offer in 2018-2019 were ultimately accepted. This concerns me because 1) Why did the number of students accepted from the waitlist drop so significantly? And 2) Will this significant drop in waitlist acceptances be similar to this year’s application cycle? 

Any input would be great. Regardless, fingers crossed!"

20 units. 2 upper div econ classes. 2 upper div math classes. Midterms every week. 

4 horrible professors. Countless errors on each syllabus. Lectures are slow and sloppy. We are spending more time fixing each syllabus than learning the material. Live lecture recordings take days to be posted online. OHs are just a continuation of syllabus corrections. Completely useless TAs. 

I’m sure the professors and TAs are going through their own struggles, but I’ve taken 6 online classes before; I’ve never experienced such a high level of disorganization. 

I also joined a few Zoom “study groups” in each class. All I’ve learned so far is that my classmates are absolutely miserable. What are the chances that all 4 of my classes are coming along this poorly? 

This is my first quarter back in school after taking a 2-year gap to work and support my mom. Sigh. What a nightmare. I hope you are having a better quarter than I am.

EDIT #1: I asked all 4 professors if I can just take their final exams and be done with this quarter. 1 said no, 2 said yes, and 1 said they will have to speak with me via video chat before further consideration. If this quarter is just too much for you to handle, and you are confident in your ability to study at an accelerated pace, I suggest asking for what I asked for. I’ve done it before in Fall 2017 (although the classes were chemE at that time).

While we all have the option to use notes for an open note exam, not all of have the financial resources (me included) for these more advanced cheating methods, so then again its truly not equal. I feel like the worst part is that professors are going to make their exams harder because of this and/or there would be no curve in the classes because of the fact that some people can cheat more effectively  than others.

This is my first post here, but I made an account so I can express this frustrating notion that I feel about housing in Davis. Does anyone else feel like it is unfair and slightly abusive that apartments enforce a yearly contract and then if you want to break the lease you have to do their job and find someone to replace you?

I feel like this isn't the normal thing in other cities. My sister just got a new job and her lease ends in October, but she just broke her lease (just paid extra and sometimes nothing at all) and she is moving to another city. I feel as though apartment complexes abuse students because they know that they can get away with it. Being a student is t a flexible time in your life. You could drop out, you can get kicked out, you might have to move home, you might have so many things that change as a grad student where you travel and stay somewhere else for months on end unexpectedly. It's not a concrete thing like if you are a family and have a stable job for years in one place. 

Yes, if you sign the lease it is your fault and you should know the circumstances, but whose to know what happens in the future? Like who knew that schools would be online in December 2019 when they renewed their lease. That is something you can't even anticipate. They ask you to sign it earlier and earlier every year. For me they asked me to renew in December. Then they say there is a deadline to renew and you feel pressure to renew. Also if you ask for a monthly lease or at least a half year lease, they wouldn't even offer it to you. If you don't agree with their yearly lease then you don't have a place to live. Yes, I know you can get a house or not live in an apartment. But why are these people allowed to profit so much like this?

It's also their job if they work there to find tenants. What do they do if they can't even do this? Also Davis has a 98% vacancy rate meaning that apartments are usually very full. Correct me if I'm wrong on that. So I feel like they put the pressure on the students to make their lives easier and they are a multi-million dollar company and you are just one student dealing with getting your life together.

The classics department consistently has some of the strongest lecturers I've seen. Not only do they have a phenomenal ability to facilitate discussion and link cultural practices today to distant historical origins, they're also super down to geek out about Classical Greeks and Romans at the drop of a hat. It's so nice to see professors who really enjoy what they teach and try to give their students that same excitement for the material. 

You may not care about old dead people, but you know what's fun about studying classics? Inside jokes. A lot of western entertainment is derived from classical sources, so it's a really awesome moment to read or watch through something unrelated and realize hey there's a reference that one guy my professor told me about!

If you have space in your schedule, a classics course would be a wonderful way to spend a quarter. It's fun, you get to listen to some of the coolest professors, and the department offers a wide array of courses intended to be accommodating to non-majors.

What catalyzed this post was the sheer amount of empathy my CLA professor has for his students this quarter. I'm nearly run ragged from other courses, but in this class I'm able to take a breath and just learn about something that I think is crazy interesting."

Are transfer students a rarity in the residence halls?  Will I be surrounded by freshmen?  Do they room transfers with other transfers in the residence halls? 

From what I understand you can apply to live is a residence hall if you’re 24 or under.  Although from the transfer housing seminars I attended it sound like transfers are encouraged to stay in the transfer apartments rather than the residence halls.  I am also considering applying to live in a co-op but I feel like the co-op housing maybe in high demand and it will be hard to get a spot in one without knowing someone.  Really confused by the whole process of applying for housing,  even more so because COVID has everything up in the air right now.

Dual enroll or something, just make sure the credits are transferable.

The course is really as bad as everyone says. Was written by UCDavis professors like 20 years ago and taught super weird compared to how nearly every other school teaches it. It translates horribly online too. Super long labs that are only worth a small portion of your grade. Honestly, they range from 3 to 6 pages long and you have two labs a week, worth about 2 points each! On top of that, you are expected to do the labs from material you haven't even been exposed to. This is meant for ""self-discovery"" as if we all have the time or desire to rediscover physics within 10 weeks. This wouldn't be a huge problem if we could reference a well-written textbook but their online text is so useless. Think about it. If a 4 unit science course textbook is condensed to about 30 pages of online text, you are going to leave a lot of information out.

Countless students have complained but the physics department does not want to change it because it COSTS TOO MUCH for them to change it. WE THE STUDENTS PAY FOR THESE COURSES. If a majority of students feel like they are not learning much then we are not getting our money's worth. It's not just students, TA's also share their dislike towards the structure of the course.

TLDR: Do yourself a solid and take Physics at a community college, bleed the Physics department of their enrollment until they are forced to change the 7series to better serve the students but more importantly you'll learn more from a community college course.

Go Aggies!

Edit:

1. If you can’t dual enroll or don’t feel like it, others have said the 9 series is better organized. There’s a prerequisite for it though.
2. Some majors require you to take the 7 series so don’t play yourself and check with your advisor first.
3. A few people have said they like it so you can always try your luck. Keep in mind that everything is online until further notice so you will be watching videos for labs.
4. If you’re already wrist deep in the peanut butter, some have mentioned Casey Davis as a great resource for the 7 series."

I often find that the Cs advisors take a long time to respond to emails and aren't as helpful as I wish they were. I understand they're overwhelmed because it's one of us impacted majors. I get it so we have to get together and support each other

We should share which classes require the least amount of pre reqs and which professors are the easiest to take. Often CS minors do not have quite the same level of coding skill as the majors so taking classes that are more tolerable toward the learning curve and hopefully the most enjoyable is important

We should create a list of classes that CS minors should take and we should exchange information on our experiences in these classes and tips for passing everything and getting through everything so you can finish a minor within a reasonable. Of time"

I graduated months back and have been struggling to find a job in the industry. I guess I am fucked for a while. So here's one of the I advise to do before your senior year:

* **Get an internship**

If that means having to make self-projects on your free time, and grinding Leetcode, then that's worth taking your time doing all of that and not ending up in the situation that I am in right now.

* **Take ECS36B/ECS 36C (Formerly ECS 40/60) seriously.**

These are probably two of the most important classes in the intro sequences, and I regrettably took 2 shitty professors. I barely made my way through these classes and lack some essential practices in my skillset as a result. 36C is especially important as data structures will be asked in the majority of coding interviews in the West Coast.

* **Upload your Leetcode solutions to Github**

Obviously, don't upload some garbage code that runs at O(n^4) or anything like that, but if you want to impress future employers, definitely do that. I mentioned self-projects earlier, but your ability to implement data structures is much more important.

* **Learn HTML/CSS/Javascript**

I can't emphasize this enough. A good chunk of wed development positions for software development these days requirement knowledge of these. Davis is a heavily theoretical school for CS, and graduating with only a knowledge of C++/C (which is what most professors use) is going to hurt in the long run as there are barely any entry level positions for C++/C. Knowing only just Python on the side isn't good enough.

Just please, don't be like me. I am currently struggling like no tomorrow finding a position right now."

This whole housing situation is really bothering me. I know that as an individual person nothing I want, say or do matters and that only what is good for the business is what matters.

I don’t regret going to cc but I was pretty lonely the entire time, so I was excited to meet new ppl. Basically is it stupid to go back to cc once I’m already in a pretty great uc and can just finish getting my degree in two years if I take summer sessions. If anyone wants to know my stats, I have a 3.78 gpa, no real extra curriculars besides working and being a full time student.

I never plagiarized. Some teachers were interviewed and a teacher straight up lied and said that my essay was at a higher writing standard than the power point slide we used for the presentation. I literally copy pasted from my essay which was written by me, and pasted it on the slide. That teacher also told SJA that I was off topic on the assignment which could be a red flag for getting help or having someone write the essay for me. I have emails with the teacher approving my “off topic” topic. 
I tried reasoning with SJA by trying to send them proof of everything but they basically said “we think you’re cheating because the teacher said so, we don’t have real proof though, just suck it up and take this mark on your educational record, and the referral is closed so don’t worry about it anymore.”

Any other STEM-related transfer students struggling this quarter? I feel as if every transfer student in my classes is adjusting well, seeing them ace their midterms while I'm legit failing mine. I know everyone has their own struggles, but at least theirs are paying off, right? I have no idea how I got in and I firmly state that I do not deserve this position. 

 As a reference, my two major courses are STA 100 (Kim) and BIS 102 (McKenney). Yes, the easy courses. The easy professors. I should be getting an A in both. I'm active in study groups and go to office hours. I feel like i understand the material and am actively changing my study habits. In reality, I'm actually failing. Nothing pays off. Well. I did better on the second BIS midterm, but I am begrudgingly struggling in stats and it's embarrassing since everyone raves about it being the ""easy"" math course. Not that I'm not used to being an embarrassment though. It's normal for me to  suck at everything academically. 

I plan to take P/NP for both bc either way I will never get into grad school and my GPA is shit. Not to mention my major requires an internship to graduate and many companies require a GPA threshold to be met. RIP

I've talked to the dean in my department and plan to email my advisor to see if there's anything I can do in case I do end up failing those two courses. The most I can do is bust out in the last midterms and finals and hope I can pass. I have also been diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety, so perhaps that's playing a part as to why I am struggling so badly in my online courses. But I can never use that as an excuse. Maybe accommodations next quarter might help. 

 I'm already fucked for the future no matter what happens this quarter so there's that. Been so negative since the quarter started and having unneccessary breakdowns every once in a while. It's embarrassing. I don't really want much from this, maybe someone to relate with? Not that I know of anyone that's struggling in their classes. 

I just hope I'm not the only person feeling this way and if there's a way to pick up from this. That's all."

A few months ago, most announcements pointed to the notion that in-person instruction wouldn't be a possibility until early-mid 2022. While I know the recent mass distribution of vaccines has driven optimism, it seems a bit too hopeful for **everyone** in the university to get vaccinated pre Septemeber 2021 (please feel free correct me on this with sources).

Highlights below:

\- UC Davis Health frontline workers were among the first to receive the COVID vaccine.  
\- Continue to wear masks, social distance, wash hands &amp; get tested often as vaccines become available to everyone.  
\- Avoid non-essential travel.  
\- Students must get tested within 7 days before &amp; after any travel for winter break &amp; self-quarantine for a min. of 10 days, even if tested negative.  
\- We are hoping for an expanded range of in-person learning activities for Spring 2021.  
\- We expect Fall 2021 will return to pre-pandemic, in-person instruction.

I am probably 20 hours behind in my lectures. Whenever I do homework, I just write random stuff and get a C. Most of my quizzes and midterms are during next week with a couple assignments due this week. 

I feel like I'm not really learning anything. I'm just doing the bare minimum to get a 2.0. I think the classes that I'm taking are enjoyable but tbh I haven't done shet for them. I just browse youtube 10 hours a day and scramble to turn in my assignments 10 minutes before they're due.

Last quarter I got my gpa above 2.0 by getting three C's and 1 A (GE). It looks like this might be it. This might be the straw that breaks the camel's back. I got away putting in almost no effort but I don't know if I can even get above a 2.0 this quarter.

I know that I have to grind it out this week so I can cram the previous four weeks of material into my brain but I lack motivation because I've been trying to put in effort the last four weeks and I just end up in the spot that I'm in now, always skipping classes to make up for the work that I was supposed to do days ago and falling further behind."

I went through a breakup with my closest friend / boyfriend. We used to tell each other everything and now we barely talk. And there's this other friend I've been talking to who's always been there for me. He helped make the transition to college feel less lonely and he's kept me company through a lot of rough shit. Well, I pushed too hard when I thought he was joking and now he won't talk to me or return my calls. 

I don't think I'm a bad person or have personality issues because I haven't gotten that impression from others. People generally like me (I think) and I think this is just him wanting some alone time. 

The thing is, this still hurts like a motherfucker. I have some friends from middle and high school, but they're almost always unavailable and though we do talk, I don't feel as close with them. I have one close friend who's always there to support me through whatever I'm going through and doesn't get annoyed with me, but it's just not enough.

It feels like life used to be so full of color and life, and now I spend my nights just waiting to fall asleep and I honestly dread waking up. I have piles of homework to do and I can't focus. It feels like my body is on fire because of the physiological reaction from feeling so alone. I'm in a mid tier difficulty major and I don't know if I'll make it through. 

My roommates are very friendly and I think we're going to become closer, but I haven't known them for very long and I honestly just need my old friends back. I miss them so much.

I think part of this is just my personality. My siblings have gone through similar circumstances but I'm the only one to react this way, or they're very good at hiding it. I feel like adverse circumstances affect me more than others.

The power over at least a quarter of Davis is still out, and that stinks, but when it died Comcast died too. I don’t mean my modem lost power. Some of us are fortunate enough to have huge battery backups to keep essential network gear running. So my network gear has enough power to keep running for about 2 days without PG&amp;E. That was important before I lived in Davis because the internet is often how people make phone calls now. My phone is through Comcast. I’m weird. I have a “phone line” but it is with Comcast. Great. Right? Wrong. Comcast’s shitty network died when PG&amp;E did. So I ask you, which one provides worse service to Davis?"

I have multiple panic attacks throughout the day, I wake up multiple times throughout the night because of the nightmares it causes, and top of that I've lost three loved ones this year to various reasons. When reached out to my TA and professor about this for one class, they basically told me a two day extension on an assignment is the best they can do. Even on weeks where I'm feeling super good, giving it 200%, I still fail ever exam and get Fs on every homework assignment.

Here's why I'm panicking. I'm in a history GE and I'm supposed to be watching lectures asynchronously, taking notes in discussion, and taking notes in the readings. I have been to two discussions all quarter and have done 0 work for the class. Our ""midterm"" is to turn in all these notes.

I was thinking of just half assing it and turning in as much as I can, but it's obvious I need help and I can't just keep doing the absolutely minimum to keep my head above the water.

My question is, what the heck do I do? How do I salvage my GPA? How do I avoid academic disqualification? Who should I be reaching out to? I literally can't afford to get kicked out school.

Shincheonji has been and is still active at UC Davis, as well as at other colleges and universities within the Sacramento, Vacaville, and Davis area and nearby regions like the San Francisco Bay Area. Shincheonji recruiters will not initially reveal the name of their campus ministry or group until people have progressed in the the Bible studies with SCJ. SCJ recruiters will also not tell anyone that they're part of SCJ until one has completed all the lessons with SCJ. There are several ways to identify SCJ-affiliated groups:

\- The Bible studies begin with introductory lessons, followed by small class lessons (lasts about 6 to 9 months), followed by large class lessons (lasts about 1 year)

\- The Bible lessons mention about ""history, moral teaching/instruction, prophecy, fulfillment""

\- The Bible lessons are heavy on parables and on the knowledge and understanding of parables, and teach that one must know and understand the parables to receive salvation

\- There are Bible lessons about ""the Language of Heaven"", meaning parables

\- Bible lessons are in classroom format, with teachers and students. The teachers will occasionally use whiteboards or pieces of paper to write notes and draw pictures of what they're teaching. The Bible lessons will generally be in one direction only (teacher to student)

\- Notes are to be taken, but only through handwriting. Taking pictures of what's on the whiteboard or the piece of paper is forbidden. One also can only use a physical copy of the Bible

\- ""Hand clapping for God"" at the end of each Bible lesson is a custom everyone must do at the end of the closing prayer

\- Bible lessons talk heavily and frequently about spiritual harvests, spiritual food, fields, birds, vines, among other things

\- In later Bible lessons, there will be more weird unbiblical teachings, such as teachings about the ""Promised Pastor"" and about the ""New John."" These two terms refer to the leader and founder of Shincheonji, Manhee Lee. Additionally, they will also teach later on when one goes further in the Bible studies that lying is okay under circumstances and take various Bible verses out of context to justify lying, despite the fact that the Bible clearly teaches that lying is a sin (I never got to this point when I studied the Bible with Shincheonji members, but this is based on my research on Shincheonji and its affiliated groups after I left NorCal Missions, which is the current name for one of SCJ's groups in the Bay Area and nearby regions and which is the group I studied with for 6 months before leaving it)

\- The Bible study group teaches that one cannot be sure of their faith or that they were truly saved until they do everything Jesus tells people to do in Scripture, according to what the Bible study group teaches, in addition to knowing and understanding all the parables

\- Teachers and leaders don't let any student learn most Bible lessons individually nor do they explain certain lessons to students individually because they say the lessons can only be taught in the small class or the large class

\- Discussions and questions about the Bible or any theological concept are generally discouraged or even forbidden unless if the student agrees with what the teacher tells them. Otherwise, the teachers may accuse students of stirring up doubt or of wanting to argue or debate with them, or they might stop talking to those students

\- Members of the Bible study group will claim that it goes over the entire Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, but in reality they only go over snippets of verses and passages of Scripture, based on the lessons

\- At the end of each level (beginner, intermediate, and advanced), there is a test to be taken by the students

\- Recruiters, teachers, and leaders claim that a cult is merely where there is no truth in it, nor is God present in it, without realizing a cult is not just that, but also where there are some extreme or bizarre beliefs and teachings, manipulation and other types of abuse especially from teachers and leaders, and several other characteristics of cults like being secretive, unquestioned obedience to the leaders, cutting off contact with ex-members and non-members and even discouraging or forbidding genuine friendships within the cult. These characteristics are all present in Shincheonji

\- There are a variety of events held by the group or  campus ministry itself, such as seminars where only the main speaker speaks and everyone else listens

Additionally, SCJ-affiliated groups will occasionally change their names to avoid being exposed as being affiliated with SCJ or once those groups have been exposed as being affiliated with SCJ. Shincheonji in the Sacramento, Vacaville, and Davis area and nearby regions have a church or mission center called the San Francisco Zion Church. Within the Sacramento, Vacaville, and Davis area and nearby regions such as the San Francisco Bay Area, SCJ groups are currently known as NorCal Missions and True Vine SF, and SCJ also runs a website called Bible Study For All. Other names that various SCJ-affiliated groups went by in the Sacramento, Vacaville, and Davis area and nearby regions like the SF Bay Area include Ignite Ministry, True Vine Ministries, Religare, Global Light, Revive Sacramento, Zion Missionary, and Christians of NorCal. One other group in the Bay Area that I found out online that I suspect was another SCJ group is Revival SJSU.

Shincheonji is currently recruiting UC Davis students, alumni, faculty, and staff through Instagram and other social media platforms due to the COVID pandemic and restrictions and all other activities are online due to the pandemic and restrictions. They especially target Christians, and have been trying to recruit people from Intervarsity, Cru, the Newman Center, Bridges International, and other campus ministries. In addition, Shincheonji is also recruiting people who are neither students, alumni, faculty, nor staff of UC Davis within the Sacramento, Vacaville, and Davis area and nearby areas, in person and online.

If you are studying the Bible with an SCJ-affiliated group like NorCal Missions, quickly leave that group and encourage anyone in an SCJ-affiliated group, including those you know to leave that group. Shincheonji-affiliated groups such as NorCal Missions are not healthy Bible study groups for anyone, whether or not they're Christian, and they will not help Christians grow in their faith in God."

I am planning a move to Davis, and was wondering if anybody could give  me a sense of how the rental market works there. I have so many  questions, but here are a few important ones that I came up with:

1. What  is the ""rental season"" in Davis? It's mid March, and there are a fair  number of units listed on the usual websites (e.g., craigslist, zillow,  etc.). However, there are fewer than I expected given my experience  living in other college towns. Am I bit late in my search for housing  right now?
2. I'm  sure this depends on the area, but what are ""fair"" rents for a 1  bedroom apartment? It seems like one bedroom apartments start at \~ $1400  and can get up to $1800. From what I've seen, a lot of the cheaper  units appear to be concentrated downtown, with the more expensive ones  located in newer complexes spread throughout town.
3. More  generally speaking, are there any areas, apartment complexes, property  management companies, or landlords that I should avoid?

I'm looking forward to hearing your insights. Thank you so much in advance!"

Hi, r/UCDavis!

Just to let you all know, so far, it’s looking like the P/NP deadline will NOT be on the last day of instruction for Spring 2021.

The [Quarter Dates &amp; Deadlines calendar](https://registrar.ucdavis.edu/calendar/quarter) lists the 25th day of instruction (that’s Friday, April 30, 2021) as the last day to choose P/NP. Also, on the [P/NP information page](https://registrar.ucdavis.edu/records/grades/pass-no-pass) from the UC Davis Registrar website does not list a date for Spring 2021 under their COVID-19 Exceptions information box.

Of course, I'm sure the situation can change at some point in the future. I just wanted to leave this here in case the P/NP deadline is not extended to the last day of instruction next quarter."

In-person commencement is first-come, first-serve basis. Those who receive emails without RVSP link is basically screwed. Even if we ask a friend to send us the RVSP link, it’s still late compared to when the initial email or text messages was sent. Especially, when there’s a limit of 300 people per commencement session (there’s ONLY 6 sessions for undergraduates). There’s THOUSANDS of us who are eligible for an in-person commencement."

Sage Corps is an internship placement company that asks “top students” to pay thousands of dollars to do an unpaid internship. But I’m warning you that they are a potentially predatory company. If you really were a top student, why would you need to pay someone to do an unpaid internship?

First, Sage Corps hunts students down through their emails to university departments, asking them to spam their students. My university, unfortunately, did not foresee that I would become the company’s prey.

Their application process traps students. The interviewer only asked me a few behavioral questions, so there was no formal screening process—their claim of sending “top students” is shady. After the interview, I was asked to sign a binding contract and pay a $1000 initial deposit. But I had to sign this contract months before they placed me with a company. Little did I know that Sage Corps would later use the binding contract to extort $2000 from me.

During the two months following the contract signing, they helped me edit my resume—a service worth $5 on Fiverr.com—and gave me access to this “career accelerator program,” a compilation of around $100 worth of Udemy courses. The only thing I paid for with real value was the housing, provided through Sage Corps by a third-party, at $3000. 

But something unexpected happened related to COVID-19. When I asked Sage Corps if I needed a visa for my internship, they said I needed a CPT. So, I saw my university counselor, but he told me that since I was an international student who did his first year online and not in-person, I could not get CPT authorization. Sage Corps—despite knowing that I am a first-year international student doing online school—did not check beforehand whether I was eligible for the internship. Nothing on their website, unlike other companies detailing internship requirements, mentioned the need for a CPT. 

I informed Sage Corps I was not authorized to do an internship. They scheduled a call for me with the company’s CEO. He suggested I enter the US as a tourist to do the unpaid internship, pay for travel to and one-night stay in Canada after the internship, and return to the US to activate my F1 visa. Does this proposition, from a professional international internship company, sound legitimate?  

And the CEO failed to be reasonable and understanding throughout. When I asked for a refund because of circumstances that made it impossible to do the internship, he blamed me. He blamed me for circumstances caused by COVID-19. He even refused to give a refund minus Sage Corps’s incurred costs. 

I tried to reason with him through email, again and again. I let him know that my parents had to take loans to finance my education, so him taking thousands of dollars—for no mistake of my own—was a gunshot wound. 

More unreasonable was that he told me he had given us, this summer’s cohort, the wrong contract to sign. I was bound to a contract for a remote internship, which cost $2000. I never wanted to do a remote internship, and I made that clear from the start. 

So, even though he admitted the contract was a mistake, he said I had to do the online internship program or that he could only refund me $2000. He made me liable for his mistake, and he even tried to gaslight me. He said I failed to sign the new in-person-internship contract unlike the other students—but he never sent me this contract—and was obligated to pay $6800. He said he was making an “exception” to his policy by giving me $2000 of $4000 back. 

When I pleaded for at least the $3000 housing payment, he said Sage Corps has incurred costs like the resume editing and learning modules that have “already been activated and paid for.” 

But that was a lie. After refunding me $2000, he deactivated the learning modules. He could reverse the arrangement with Udemy all along. 

I’m a student in debt, and Sage Corps and its CEO tried to manipulate me to work without authorization, tried to gaslight me into thinking I’m to blame for COVID-19 circumstances, and bullied and lied to me. This is how a predator would behave: hunting me down, trapping me, deceiving and wounding me, and taking my money. 

Today, I’m $2000 more in debt because of Sage Corps. 

I hope my post will save you from Sage Corps and similar unethical companies and prevent you from making the same mistake I did: selling myself short and paying thousands for work.

Today, she sent out an email saying that if a few more students don't register for the class, the department will cancel which would really suck. If you have free time over the next couple weeks, any kind of interest in voice acting and want to have some fun, it would be great if you signed up! There aren't any prerequisites required!  It's a pretty rare opportunity, so I hope the class can run. Thank you :)

I have looked on Youtube and there's a lot of negative videos on the humanities and honestly i feel worthless. I feel hesitant to go into EE because of the heavy classes and programming classes. I have tried learning programming on my own on codeacademy, it just never works out for me. Are the classes different compared to learning on your own? Is there even a lot of coding or am I just worrying over nothing?

We get it. You're hip. You have an app.

But please for the love of all that is holy will you  post meaningful signs in parking lots? You know, signs that have useful information and that are visible from the street? Like signs that show clearly to people driving by what kind of lot it is?

Today, I saw dozens of students zooming through A lots, one hand on their steering wheel, one hand (and often two eyes) on their phone or scanning the lot for the tiny, tiny signs that announced they were in an A lot, (some times parking and getting out of their cars, only to discover this fact,) and then zooming away at dangerous speeds to try to find a C lot.

This is happening because your signage is absolutely, pathetically useless. Nobody cares what *number* the lot is. Everyone cares what its *letter designation* is. A sign that has, in giant letters, ""LOT 5"" doesn't help a driver know if they can park there. A sign that says in giant letters ""C PERMITS"" does. This isn't a complicated idea.

Your app is cute. It does what apps do. It lets you collect money. It makes you feel current. It compromises our confidential information.

It's also largely useless--and potential dangerous--as a navigation tool. And your lack of meaningful signage means that people are going to be staring at their phones and not looking at the actual, physical world through which they are moving in 3,000 pound steel machines.

I’m a freshman at UC Davis majoring in NPB and I want to ask for some advices regarding some courses. Specifically, I’m considering between taking Art 002 or a first year seminar. Currently, I’m taking 15 units including the seminar. However, I keep doubting my choice of taking the seminar (it’s a research one where you get to make your own enzyme) since I’m already taking a lab class this quarter and I really love drawing. The seminar also only offers 2 units and doesn’t fulfill any GE. But if I drop out of that seminar and take the art class, not only my units will rise to 18 units (which is beyond the recommended amount for freshman), but I afraid I might lose a good chance to highlight my record since I’m pre med. Can you guys give me your opinion please? What will you do if you were in my position? I check the schedule already and apparently the seminar is only offered in fall quarter, and I know I can try to take art class next semester instead but I just feel excited for it. Please help me, thank you so much!!"

It wasn’t in some corner of the room either, but in broad daylight around a lot of people.
It happened in the Quad where all of the clubs were set up. I was near a table set up for the Chicanx and Latinx club. The table had a few people asking questions. A few feet from the table were three male students. I heard their conversation go something like this;
“What kinda table is this for?”
“Beaners.”
“Beaners?”
“Yeah, for the beaners.”
The three students laughed amongst themselves. I don’t think anyone else heard them since there were hundreds of people talking on the Quad.
It was pretty shocking considering; 1. UCD is a pretty diverse and liberal campus 2. The three males were Asian, a demographic that have unfortunately been increasingly the targets of racial discrimination since this past year. 
It’s pretty disheartening to hear that kind of talk coming from fellow students. I don’t know what might have happened to prompt such a response from these individuals, but being divided by race is something that helps no one and fuels very hurtful emotions.
Please don’t say these types of things, even if its to be ‘edgy’ and make your friends laugh."

If this is confusing dw I'm confused too also tryna keep this vague but also cohesive enough. I don't know how that turned out. **(TW: some mentally unhealthy stuff at the end?)**

I've been hitting it off with A Person, recently. We hung out, we clicked, I thanked whatever god above existed that we're back on campus so that we could meet up *at all.* I felt that chemistry between us. Yadda yadda, the usual bullcrap. We were at a party a while ago and we had a fun time and I thought I could finally make a move, but there hadn't been enough liquid courage in me then. In the end we parted ways as usual. All good.

So naturally I said fuck it and told them I liked them and would like to be in a relationship with them literally not long after that party. Spoiler alert they said *no not ready for anything like that* ***in general at all*** *thanks*. Okay then I get it they're a busy person chasing their future, I get it, I support it, I admire it. Took a few weeks to recover from that but I'd say we weren't too awkward afterwards. I finally felt MORE okay a few days ago; trying to graduate next summer, been keeping busy THIS quarter. Still partied with a few friends though because that shit's always fun.

Met some new people at said party.

Including someone who said that, ""I was recently asked out by A Person literally after giving them my number like wow they certainly wasted no time!""

To which my friend (who had no knowledge of any shit going down between myself and A Person) saying, ""Oh my god they asked me out the moment they got my number too, like after we met a few weeks ago??""

Wow that shit hurt to write out haha how horrible of a person am I to have deserved this.

Anyways. That all happened.

I don't know why I'm even posting this. Desperately hoping no individuals mentioned in this stupid post actualy browse the ucd subreddit (my friends included. They're nice and amazing people but I'd rather redditor Aggies read about this stranger's humiliation and misery). If people do recognize the me in this post and the me IRL that'd be super awkward just smile and nod and not mention it to me thank you. Not a confrontation I'm ready to go through right now, and all that.

Currently considering going to student counselling because damn if I don't have issues resurfacing now thanks to this *wonderful* human being (been getting closer and closer to having full blown panic attacks, wondering if I'm overreacting, questioning my self-worth even though I should know better, it's *just hard*, during *midterms week,* in *publc, o*n our *first quarter back to being offline,* this is *fun*). HEM won't allow me to make online appointments somehow, though. Does anybody have experience just walking into the SCHS building and making an appointment there? Please comment if you do, I don't usually look through my DMs so comments'll help a lot. Also I think I'd just cry on the spot if I walk in and can't make an appointment.

So yeah. Thanks for reading. And potentially commenting. Stay safe. Don't forget to study if you still have midterms. Or just study for the sake of studying, you're awesome. Hope y'all are doing better than I am this quarter. Man this sucks.

TL;DR: was close to A Person. A Person said no i don't wanna commit to anything with anyone. A Person had actually made advances to other people wanting to commit. I feel like shit. Can I just walk into SCHS without a prior appointment and ask for one because HEM isn't working for me?"

\-I assume it's not that easy to just complete it in a fresh start under 2 years. I understand that you are required to give a portfolio if you planned to get into the major, so how was that like?

Would an iPad work well? I used my laptop mainly for essays and to study lecture notes, so I would use the iPad for that. I still have to take HDE 120 and I'm not sure if that requires any apps that the iPad is not compatible with. I also want something that will last me years since I haven't had the best experience with HP.

also my budget is $400-800 which is why I'm not considering a Mac at the moment"

I’ve gone to events hosted by FIL-AM &amp; Mga Kapatid as well as KASA ( Korean American Association ) due to friends bringing me along or inviting me. They have been REALLY fun and I know multiple people in these organizations but I don’t identify as Filipino or Korean and would feel weird joining the actual clubs. I really like the concept of a large social club that has the main goal of just having fun events and making friends and even the idea of a big/little program but don’t know very many other organizations that are like that!!! Maybe some that aren’t identity/culture based ?? I don’t know if that sounds weird. 

Anyways, I’m hoping some people have some recommendations!! Good luck with finals :)"
