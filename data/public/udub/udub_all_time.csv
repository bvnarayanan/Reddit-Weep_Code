My name is Bryce, and I'm this year's chair of the [Student Technology Fee Committee](https://uwstf.org/about). 

**About**

The STFC is a group of 9 voting students appointed by ASUW and GPSS that fund technology needs around the Seattle campuses. Back in the late '80s early '90s, [Washington State law was updated](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=28B.15.051) to allow student populations to vote on creating a fee for all matriculated students. UW students sprang at the opportunity, and the STF was born. 

The STF funds many of the things around campus that you may have never given a second thought to; The Odegaard computer lab, the Student Technology Loan Program in Kane, The Daily, Mary Gates Hall's computer labs, scanning electron microscopes, dozens of 3D printers, Fluke Hall's Makerspace, Gould Hall's Makerspace, canopy measurement equipment, GPS units, and thousands of other items. Currently, the STF sees yearly revenue of around $5 million, so there's no shortage of money, nor proposal too large.

The best part of the STF is that everything the STF purchases, you can use, for free (departments may charge for use of consumable materials i.e. paper, ink, etc.). You pay the $38 a quarter, so all the equipment is for your use.

We have a quarterly proposal cycle, and our Winter Proposals are due in by this Friday. As students, you and I have the best viewpoint to address *the* most important question to STF: ""What do students need?"" If you'd like to know more, have a great idea that needs money, or are thinking of proposing, you can reach me here, by PM, by [email](mailto://stfchair@uw.edu), or at our [Proposal Workshop](https://uwstf.org/calendar) tomorrow

**Some particularly neat things the STF funded include**

*The Original Campus WiFi Rollout*, back when WiFi was new. The UW wasn't sold on this new-fangled wireless stuff, so the STF funded the initial implementation. It proved a hit (obviously), and was transferred to UW IT to maintain indefinitely

*The Student Technology Loan Program*, created to address short term student technological needs. It was originally branded the ""STF Equipment Loan Program,"" in a bid for people to recognize the committee, but students began to associate STF with the loan program, not the fee at large. Now the STLP receives free room from UW IT, salaried employees from the Student Activities Fee, and all its equipment from the STF

*Portage Bay Water Equipment*. So this one requires a bit of explanation: There's this program to monitor underwater volcanoes off the coast of Washington. The department that does this wanted to get their students some hands-on with similar equipment to get them to understand the science of it all. So they bought a water quality sensor box, with something special: it had no sensors! Students get to make their own sensors, slide it into the housing, and then drop the thing into Portage Bay. It's the first time any continuous water quality measurement is coming out of that body of water, and the data is made readily available for other students to use

*Burke Museum Artifact Cataloger*. The whole purpose of the committee is to weigh the benefit of proposals, but often it's not easy. For the Ode computer lab, it's  quite easy to see tangible benefit to students: they have 50k unique logins a year! But the artifact cataloger was only going to be used by half a dozen people. Obviously we shouldn't fund it, right? Not so fast-- the cataloger was is used to take pictures of artifacts and dump it into a database. That database is then freely available to all students. Furthermore, by purchasing into this tech, we gained access to a much wider super collection of all the other databases by other colleges with the same equipment. We'll never know how many students benefit from that proposal, but it's clear that there was a mass of intangible benefit. 

*3D Handheld Scanners*, which allow you to walk around an object and create an exact replica in a computer. Cool for all sorts of uses, one that I found super interesting was archeology students scanning unmovable fossils, then 3D printing replicas for hands-on use!

*Geographical Mapping Drones*, which can be flown over mountainous terrain. The drones are so sensitive, they can be used to measure tree growth year over year. A group of students took these up to Alaska and created maps of never-before-explored mountains. 

**Conclusion**

I'll be here to answer any questions, comments, concerns, ^thoughts, ^^^dreams you might have, so ask away!

I originally made this map to help me decide what to eat and I've updated it over the years.

A few notes:

-Not meant to be absolutely complete. For instance, the 42nd street intersection is already cram-labeled. Still, recommendations are welcome!

-Notable Additions: An Ezell's chicken opened in Wallingford; up the hill near Kabul and Taco Time. A new Rancho Bravo opened up next to China First. There are two Shawarma Kings on the Ave; same owner.

-Notable Removals: Memo's burned my roommate with a poisoning that lingered for 3 days; it's off my list. Taco Del Mar on 42nd closed. Fayza and their tiny portions died. The arrow-distance threshold is now 1 mile instead of a subjective 'walking distance'.

-I have a soft spot for fast food chains; they get the distant arrow treatment alongside local legends. (Not shown: Closest KFC is in Ballard. Closest Carl's Jr. is in Renton. Closest DQ is in Kirkland. Closest Arby's is in SODO near the light rail station.)

-Sushi Land may never open, which is a shame 'cause I really like them. The lot has been idle for three years, the permanent sign has been up for two; the only change in the last year is that paper is now covering the windows... so, maybe this year... I hope.

-Other Notes: I don't know if Dante's is still planning on re-opening; it's been over a year since a fire gutted it. Not Shown: My Favorite Deli (not my own, that's just its name) on 45th and Brooklyn. 4200-block omissions: 7-11 between Thanh Vi and Sultan Gyro; Kong Tofu House next to MOD Pizza; Cafe on the Ave kitty-corner from Madeleine.

-Open after 2AM - at least on weekends (north to south): Pizza Ragazzi, Alladin Falafel, Subway (at 45th and Roosevelt), Shawarma King (next to Earl's), Sultan Gyro, Burger Hut. (Open till 2AM flat: Dick's, Thaiger Room, Jimmy Johns.)

-I've had suggestions in the past to distinguish the dots based on reviews or recommendations. I'm not up to that, I don't trust Yelpers, and I want to keep the face of the map as neutral as possible; per its original purpose. I will play favorites in the text though, and list my own personal go-to's by category: Burgers: Dick's Drive-In --    Pizza: Pagliacci and Pudge Bros -- Breakfast: Morsel and Costas -- Thai: Thai Tom and Thaiger Room -- Pho: Pho Tran -- Gyros: Alladin Falafel -- Burritos: Chipotle and Rancho Bravo -- Philly Cheesesteak: Earl's on the Ave --  Other Sandwiches: Sarducci's and Jimmy John's -- Chicken Wings: Earl's on the Ave -- Teriyaki/Katsu: Hawaii BBQ.

**BEST**

*Paccar 192*: I love this room. Front is tables with rolly chairs, back is normal auditorium seating. Lighting is really great, tons of writing space, and general just a nice room to be in. UW's money was spent well here.

*Sieg 134*: The most comfy, squishy auditorium seats ever. Even though the rows are a bit tight on legroom, the seats are so comfy and closer to the ground so its super comfortable- 2 hour classes feel like nothing here. 

*Kane 120+upstairs*: Tons of legroom. TONS.

*Tho 101*: Comfy, big, and some really cool pivoting tables. Not so great air flow though.

Classroom wise, look for Dempsey, Paccar, Johnson, MGH, and Denny (haven't been, but heard good things)

**WORST**

*Bagley, smith*: I hate these halls. Uncomfortable wooden furniture. Weird air systems, and lets be honest, the 4th floor of Smith is a bitch to get to. 

*Fisheries*: For the freshman: its way out. Too far out. Don't take a class there unless you have a break before and after. 

*Kane 130, ARC 147, GUG 220*: Horrendous legroom. horrendous. 

Classroom wise, there are a lot of crappy ones. Chem Library, Winkenwerder, Anderson, Smith, Mech E, Lowe... all very mediocre.

I try talking to people next to me, some engage in polite conversation but the next class they sit elsewhere. Most people don't even want to sit near me. There's usually a buffer of chairs around me in class. When it comes time to work on group projects, I can never find a group that wants to work with me. Sometimes I think I'm paranoid, but I seriously think I've developed a reputation around here. I'm not sure if it's because I'm too old (late twenties), smell bad (I shower every fucking day) or because I have RBF (my forced smile looks more sinister). Maybe my introversion is crippling me to the point of isolation, but at this point I'd rather be dead than forcing enthusiasm for school anymore or facing dropping out and working a dead end job.

Also if your major does not have a pre-engineering, pre-science, or pre-whatever, congratulations you got direct admit! (I know this is true because my transcript last year said electrical engineering rather than pre-engineering and I got a direct admit offer). If you don't get direct admit to a highly competitive major, I would strongly suggest you either being okay with a less competitive major that you have a chance for (and you really don't know how hard it is to get a good GPA until you have had your first quarter here), do an open major, be open to transfer if all else fails, or if you aren't willing to settle for those other options then don't come here.

5zujw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/5zujw2/a_reflection_on_taking_18_stem_credits_in_winter/,A reflection on Taking 18 STEM credits in winter quarter,32,16,2017-03-16 17:45:09,"This was my worst quarter. I took MSE 170 (Fundamentals of Materials Science &amp; Engineering), AA 210 (Engineering Statics), MATH 308 (Matrix Algebra), PHYS 122(Electromagnetism) , MSE 273 (Intro to Molecular Engineering of Surface and Interfaces). I don't think 18 STEM credits are that much of a big deal in general. But the fact that four out of five of my classes were pre-requisites for engineering made this the hell quarter I'll never forget. I would be so screwed if I didn't get Early Admission. Actually, I think I might have given up if it wasn’t for Early Admission I know for sure I won't have to repeat MSE 170, MSE 273, but PHYS 122 and MATH 308 are up in the air.

My main complaint has to be PHYS 122 and AA 210. I wouldn't put any blame on the instructors or any of my TA's, but the unreasonable workload of those two classes dragged down my grade everywhere else. 

I don't think making sure that the students learned was the priority in Physics at UW. I could see how it could be deeply rewarding if you were say, only taking 12 credits or had some non-STEM classes to round out a full schedule. But instead of the 1.5x UW STEM multiplier for college credits, it had probably a 1.75x multiplier which made the class really 8.75 credits of work. For every class, I had to live deadline by deadline. I started out being ahead of my work but then the deadline for my Statics HW got moved by 1.5 weeks early. Before this quarter I associated doing homework as being a good student, but I now know that you should never put homework ahead of studying for midterms/finals if you had a choice.

So this is what happens when you fall behind in a Physics class at UW:
-You are unable to read the textbook before class
-You likely have to rely on classmates for clicker questions
-You have a very little grasp of what is going on in Lab and Tutorial; you might be able to understand the lecturer
-Post lab is still ""ok"" but for the Tutorial HW, you are really screwed. More specifically, if you also have people that are behind in reading as discussions partners(I am sorry that I was this person...), you are just going deeper down the rabbit hole and would either inaccurately finish filling out the tutorial or have it half-filled. This is further exacerbated by the fact that the ""correct"" answers for tutorial are not given. So you are left with an inaccurate reference for physical concepts unless you are willing to go to TA office hours...
-For lab, if your observations were ""off"", then you are equally screwed for the test.
-You become forced to rely on answer keys just to finish the homework

If they really wanted us to learn, they would give us the tutorial HW answer key and logical observations made by the TA so that you can catch your mistakes that you made while doing lab.

In sum, there are about 7 assignments that you have to turn in for PHYS 122 in a single week. This is Pre/post lab, pre/post tutorial, 2/3 reading homeworks, and one weekly MasteringPhysics HW. 

Now for AA210, you have about 5 assignments that you have to turn in each week. Hand-written HW, Connect HW, the week's lab, and two pre-lecture quizzes on Connect.

The thing about AA 210 and PHYS 122 is that they are actually high-skill cap classes (which I personally like), but you do not have time to build a skill set when you have to turn in 12 assignments each week from those two classes alone and still have to worry about your three other classes. I didn't even account for reading the textbook for just these two classes. 

What I did wrong: (besides taking this much STEM credits to begin with)
-I was a lone wolf. I am more friendly than most engineering students but once again the clique, in-group/out-group mentality prevails again(as if there is any place is exempt from this). If i tried harder to be social, I could have probably been able to see what other students that got the perfect scores on the tutorial HW did. And I kid you not, this is a studying skill you have to master if you want a higher GPA.

-I prioritized reading the textbook. It is way better to be in a study group and have each person read from one textbook and share notes and summarize than spending 2-3 hours to just go over one chapter. 

-Unless you had a good working background of physics before your time at UW, I find it nearly impossible to succeed as an individual unless you have genius-level IQ… especially if you have my winter schedule. 

What this has done to my health:
-I got sick two times this quarter exactly before and during midterms and I had a chronic cough. I tell myself the stress doesn’t get to me but apparently it got to my body. I think the cause of this was the stress induced in from my classes which lowered the virility of my immune system. I started taking vitamins and fish oil for this; I think it helped.
-Ironically, this stress went away during finals week because I didn’t have to turn in a shitload of assignments anymore. 
-I was able to go to the gym 3-4 times early in the quarter, so my muscles and stomach area became flabbier but I think I was using so much brain power that I don’t have any appreciable weight gain. 

As an in-state student who already got into engineering not having a job or doing research, I can’t begin to imagine what it would have been like for an out-of-state student still in pre-engineering who is trying to make it. Do the current admissions system find the best potential engineers? I don’t think there was a single instance in this quarter where I felt like my skills in engineering was tested. I literally didn’t build or manipulate anything in the physical sense all quarter and all I had to do was draw free bodies on engineering paper while being criticized for format and neatness. If there is a reason UW isn't ranked higher for its undergraduate engineering program, look no further than the first two years. 

EDIT: Looks like I won't have to be repeating PHYS 122!

I got approached by two very charming guys who claimed to be from ps circulation, a company that had kids work to sell magazines to people on the street, giving them points that they could use to win a scholarship. The magazines we were buying would be donated to St.Mary's Battered Women's shelter. This sounded great, and these guys were REALLY charismatic, so I picked out 3 magazines from their list that they had. They added up the cost and it was 280$. I said I didn't have that kind of money, so they reduced it to one magazine (and then asked for 20 extra dollars). They said that they could only take cash (red flag) and they sent one of them with me to get money from the atm (red flag). On the way there I took out my phone to search for this company since I was a little suspicious, and I found articles about this being a scam company and a bunch of negative reviews. I stopped right there and told them I couldn't give them money. I'm going to call the shelter tomorrow to make sure that this really is a scam.  
TLDR: People selling magazines are scam artists.

If they're still following the same pattern of sending out responses around July 20th then I wish all of you luck! And don't give up. Keep applying.

It was CSE 321 back then, I'm not sure how it fits into the new curriculum. I also had bad Math 126 grades and had to take Math 308 and Math 324 to prove I wasn't a total idiot.

&gt; September 9 &amp; 16; October 7 &amp; 28; November 4, 18, &amp; 25

We plan to monitor feedback from users to determine if this will be in effect in the future, and we apologize for any inconvenience this decision may cause.

I personally am most disappointed that the UW/UW sports provides all sorts of staff in support of football, but they don't provide staff/security for the IMA resulting unsafe conditions, plus they make it difficult for IMA staff to access campus that day to work. The IMA is a student resource, but we get nothing but ignored. "

The Dawg Daze events feel like events for people who are scared to be alone and are not about making genuine connections. Its all about meeting quantity over quality of people. Anyone have similar feelings?

It was finally turned in at the Metro Lost And Found and I just went to pick it up this morning (nothing was missing). A big thanks to everyone for contributing and up-voting for visibility, and if by chance one of you turned it in then thank you twice, you're awesome!

----- Original post: -----

I lost my wallet upon arriving at the Montlake stop on northbound Bus 48 yesterday (09/18/2017) at around 9 AM. I made a claim with Metro Transit, but nothing has turned up there.

I realize it's a bit of a long shot to post here, but I'm desperate. I am supposed to go to Vancouver, BC, next week with my girlfriend, and I have flights already booked to go back home to France to visit my family for Christmas, whom I haven't seen in over two years. It apparently takes five to six months to get a replacement Green Card, and without it, I won't be able to take that trip to Canada next week or see my family for the holidays; I won't be able to get back to my life in Seattle if I leave the U.S.

The wallet is single-fold, made of brown leather, and has an inside pocket that closes with a snap. It holds a great deal of sentimental value, as it was a gift from my best friend who lives in Australia, and it would mean a great deal to me to get this back.

I don't really care about the rest of the contents of the wallet, but I would really like to get back my Green Card ASAP and the wallet itself. If you happened to pick them up, please drop them off at the Metro Transit Lost and Found Office, mail them to the address on my driver's license, and/or PM me, no questions asked.

Thank you!"

Its that time of year again when the ground is covered with leaves. **PLEASE.** **SLOW.** **DOWN.** Leaves are extremely slippery dry or wet, and they can really mess with the grip on your tires and screw with your bike's braking ability as a result.

- Where does my money go?
- What does HFS's overall budget look like?
- Why does HFS have a retail dining model?

Please don't make any decisions about UW CSE based on salty reddit comments. The advisors are the best people to help you make an informed decision on anything related to UW CSE.

Personally I thought getting into CSE wasn't bad at all. Most of my friends got in as well. But again don't take my word for it, talk to CSE advising. I cannot stress this enough.

EDIT: Just for the record, **I'm not saying that getting into CSE is easy**. In fact for most people it is hard. All I'm saying is that I thought it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I was lucky enough to not have homesickness/anxiety/loneliness and also was able to find supportive friends who pushed me to excel at my course work. Other people might not be as lucky as I was. That being said, I still feel like the comments about CSE are overly pessimistic and not true.

It's also wonderful to see how well HFS is spending all this sandwich dough. One employee to heat up your previously assembled meal. Another to ring you up. And a third doing, well, something critical I'm sure. The whole operation certainly couldn't be replaced by adding a sandwich warmer to Etc or, heck, even simply putting a George Foreman grill on the counter.

My thoughts now are simply that Katie Beth doesn't care about our feedback and it is neccessary to go over her head. To the best of my knowledge (aka, reading the IMA contact website), the three people to contact are: 

* Gary Leonard Senior Associate Director gleonard@uw.edu
* Chad Yarbrough Member Services Coordinator cyarb@uw.edu
* Matt Newman Director mattn@uw.edu 

The first guy, because it says ""Senior"" in his name, so I assume he is important. The second because this is a member services issue, they aren't serving the members. The third guy, because he is director, so he outranks Katie the B. 

Below is my long collection of thoughts on things to include in an email. Please DO NOT COPY/PASTE. One of the major complaints was that we got a form email back. Sending a form email to them will hurt our case. Second, I have two bolded paragraphs, one is from the perspective of a student, the second is from faculty/staff. The fee is mandatory for students, but membership is optional for staff. 

Obviously feel free to, and please edit/remix/utilize what I wrote, even copy some sentences, but again, please do not simply copy/paste the entire thing, as I believe that will hurt our case by suggesting slacktivism and/or astroturfing by small group of people. 

Good Afternoon, 

I am writing in regards to the changes to the weight room which have occurred recently. I found your information off of the IMA web page and am contacting you as I feel my voice was not heard by Katie Beth when I contacted her through recinfo@uw.edu. 
I sent an email which detailed the recent issues that have been created by the changes to the weight room. In particular, the poor ventilation in the rear of the weight room has been exacerbated by the relocation of the racks to that area and the area is becoming hazardous to patrons health, both due to the slipping hazard and temperature. As well, the removal of the chalk bowls has increased the chalk mess as patrons bring their own and have nowhere to apply it in a contained manner and the lack of bumper plates has only made crowding of the platforms and racks; which was already increased due to the poor choice of replacements, worse. 
In response, I simply received a form email in return, filled with vague promises. As many people have sent in their feedback, I understand it is very difficult to respond uniquely to each email, but the vague promises of “looking into” these problems, combined with a direct copy paste of much of the statement which has been posted on the IMA webpage regarding the refresh suggest that Katie Beth, the signatory of the email, simply does not care about the feedback, but will continue to force her vision forward over the outcry from patrons. 
This form email, combined with the vague statements on the website, are deeply insulting to the patrons which frequent the IMA. I have talked to a large number of users of all levels, and have not gotten any positive feedback on the changes. This casts serious doubt on the quality of the “considerable time researching our weight room.” Entry level users have found the removal of equipment intimidating; while before they could work out in relative peace, now they have a line of people watching and waiting to use the equipment they are on. Mid level users have a tougher time completing their workout in a timely manner as the reduction in equipment directly translates to longer wait times to use the equipment. And advanced users have seen equipment removed, making it more difficult for them to accomplish their goals. 
Another issue which has become more noticeable in recent times is the “creative” utilization of equipment, in manners potentially dangerous to both the equipment and fellow patrons. The overcrowding of the platforms has led to patrons performing floor exercises such as deadlifts and Olympic lifts in random locations around the weight room. As well, anything that can be misconstrued as a rack has been used as such, including the hanging leg raise station as well as the cable stations. Meanwhile, the lack of bumper plates has led to some using one bumper plate and a collection of small diameter plates, which will result in failure of the bumper plates. 
**As a student, for whom IMA membership if mandatory, I find this particularly insulting. I do not have a choice to take my business elsewhere but can only watch as this money is spent in a manner that is opposed by myself, as well as many others. Furthermore, the poor planning of the budget drives home just how poor the planning has been. Functional equipment was removed without any explanation, and no replacement was provided because of budget constraints. This equipment should have never been removed in the first place if no replacement was available.**
**As a staff member of the University of Washington, these recent changes, and the apparent lack of interest in feedback by Katie Beth, has encouraged me to take my membership elsewhere in the future. The facilities have gone from being some of the best in Seattle to overcrowded, overheated, and uninviting. I do not wish to support the direction that the leadership is heading in, and feel that my membership provides tacit support. As such, upon completion of my current membership, I do not plan to renew.**
Finally, the complete lack of concrete explanations for these changes has been frustrating. I understand that the type of rack that was purchased is more durable that the pop-pin style racks that were replaced. However, no explanation was given for half-racks were purchased, leading to a decrease in functionality as the users of the rack and platform are much closer, nor why the racks were move from their excellent location; facing mirrors and close to ventilation to be unceremoniously shoved in the back corner. Concrete explanations of these choices, instead of vague statements such as “we spent considerable time researching” would be extremely beneficial.

What do I mean by this? Stay informed, and when you hear misinformation, say something! For example, let's go through some of the lovely comments in [this Seattle Times article.](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/uw-grad-students-hold-one-day-strike/)

I'll probably edit this post throughout the day and add more. Let me know if you have any comments or counter-arguments you'd specifically like mentioned.

**""They get free tuition!""**

This is true, but represents a fundamental misunderstanding of how graduate school works. A typical week in my life goes like this: I show up to work at 9, I attend one or two meetings and otherwise work in my office on my computer. I leave the office at about 6:30, eat, exercise, then work for another hour or two at home. I do not go to classes. The idea of a ""tuition waiver"" means absolutely nothing to us. It is bureaucratic red tape for tax purposes. We never see this money, most of us never even see the credit hours that it is technically paying for. To us, this is something that happens so that we keep our status as academic student employees (ASEs). 

**""They don't even pay taxes on tuition benefits!""**

The idea of getting taxed on this is absurd. We would be getting taxed on ""income"" we literally never touch. Imagine making $25,000 a year and paying taxes like you make $65,000. You don't need to be an entitled liberal whiner to see why that doesn't work. People couldn't be grad students. If you follow politics closely, you know that Trump's tax plan actually recently proposed this. It is so untenable that even the Republican Congress rejected the idea. 

**""They make $32 an hour and want more?""**

Our jobs are technically for 20 hours / week. Let's walk through some scenarios. 

1. I actually work 20 hours / week. I don't graduate for 10 years. The same people making this claim are now criticizing me for being a lifelong student.

2. I work what I actually need to work, which is often (always) more than 40 hours per week. I graduate on time, but I certainly can't make time for a second job. If I ask for more money to afford rent in the city where I teach, I get called an ""entitlement minded leech"".

**""They are just a privileged class whining for more free stuff!""**

We are not asking for free stuff, we are asking for a fair contract for our work. If you walk in to your bosses office and ask for a raise, are you asking for free stuff? No, that doesn't even really make sense.

In many ways (and not in many others!), we are a privileged class. But guess what happens if we aren't paid a living wage? Grad students would become way, way more privileged! Why? Because then only the independently wealthy would be able to afford graduate degrees. Is that really what you want from your public institutions?

**""Don't like it? Go somewhere else!""**

I always find this one a little funny in a very sad way. You are telling teachers and researchers at your public university to move or go elsewhere if they can't afford it. Now who teaches, and who does the research? If you think it's the professors, you are simply misinformed about how universities are actually run.

&gt; Beginning with the incoming class of fall 2019, the Allen School is expanding our Direct to Major (DTM) admissions program for incoming freshmen to be the pathway into Computer Science for the majority of UW undergraduates.  You may recall that the Allen School Student Advisory Council hosted an information session about this in Winter Quarter that Crystal and I attended.  So today's news is that this is now officially approved.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; What does this mean? Historically, as you all know first-hand, we have accepted only a small percentage of students to the CS program straight out of high school while requiring the majority of undergrads to enter CS under the “regular” admissions process. That process required students to enroll at UW as “pre-majors” and apply later for admission to CS after satisfying prerequisites. Because student interest in CS far outstrips our capacity, the old system meant a lot of unhappy students who could not get into the program having to make an agonizing choice: stay at UW and try again for CS in the next admission round, stay and try to gain admission to another major on campus, or transfer out of UW to study CS at another institution.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; The expansion of DTM will provide more certainty to students and parents. It will enable students to make informed decisions about what options are open to them before they invest time and money in their studies. It will also enable us to begin integrating more of our majors into the Allen School community as soon as they set foot on campus as freshmen—which will make for a more welcoming and rewarding experience for all.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; A few notes about how this impacts other aspects of admissions:
&gt; 
&gt; DTM will apply to the incoming class of 2019, meaning high school students who apply to UW this fall will be the first to come under the new process. We will continue to admit current UW students through the current regular admissions process in the 2018-19 academic year.
&gt; 
&gt; We will continue to offer an admission pathway to enrolled UW students, which is important for students who decide they want to pursue computer science after they arrive on campus. These “interest changers” (as they are known in the advising biz) are often some of our most engaged and successful students, and we don’t intend DTM to be an obstacle to those who discover CS “late.”
&gt; 
&gt; DTM will have no impact on the process for admitting transfer students from community and technical colleges—that process will remain the same as it is today—and there are no changes to our graduate programs as a result of DTM.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, this change impacts the CS degree only; the Computer Engineering degree will continue to fall under the College of Engineering’s Direct to College admissions program, along with its own pathways for interest changers and transfers.


**TLDR:** Starting with next year admissions to UW, CSE is switching to most DA admissions. Shouldn't affect current prospective students who are in UW too much, just new UW applicants."

I've been on both sides of the interview for the FIG program if anyone's interested in being a FIG leader themselves.

I took a FIG as a freshman and made no friends. My closest UW friends came from 200, 600 person lectures. 

Here's something I've told multiple FIG students: Making friends at UW is hard. The FIG isn't a magical place where you'll suddenly be best pals because you do one group project together. Seattle freeze is real. You have to keep introducing yourself to strangers in classes, labs, clubs, cafes, busses, etc. It's going to feel awkward and that's okay. You can't be discouraged and give up. One day you'll click with someone, or you'll see that one person you've had 3 classes with and finally get to know them.

I personally think that if you take a FIG, you have a UW veteran who can show you obscure tips/tricks and help you figure out your path at UW or find you someone that can guide you. FIG leaders train in the spring and teach in the autumn, but there's also an autumn class where FIG leaders meet together to figure out how they can best help their FIGlets. We care. A LOT. We want you to ask us questions. No question is a dumb question. Hell most professors at UW feel this way. Don't psych yourself out. Your instructors wish to see you succeed.

“Please stop asking about schedules/courses.

I know you guys are freshman and are worried about maintaining a good GPA but college is about learning independence. The point of freshman year is to make decisions for yourself and learn about yourself and grow as a person. Your first year in college, you will run into difficulties, and you have to learn to manage it. 

Asking if 3 STEM class is manageable is a silly question. You know yourself better than we know you. If you are willing to put in the effort and time, you will be fine. If you don't think you can manage your time correctly, maybe take less STEM and explore other interests. Stop worrying if a particular class will be challenging, if it's a prerequisite class, you're going to take it eventually.

All in all, most classes will be hard. You will need to put in enough effort to do well in your classes.”

It's Kathy from University of Washington's HFS student communication department.

We decided to make this post because there was something in our website that has sadly been confusing many students.

On our main website, under [""Useful Links""](https://i.imgur.com/uMDfq38.png) on the bottom of the page, there is a link to ""Contact HFS."" This page includes the quote ""We're Here to Help,"" as well as phone numbers, office hours, and locations for various HFS divisions.

Unfortunately, we felt that this link has mislead countless students into thinking we actually give a shit. We don't. Like not even a little bit. The world's strongest electron telescope couldn't even detect a fraction of the shits we give. I could go on about how little we give a shit about you, but here at HFS we like to keep things professional.

Thus, we have updated our website as follows.

[Before.](https://i.imgur.com/GBYc6ATr.png)


[After.

As you can see, our new additions to the ""Contact HFS"" page succinctly contains our attitudes towards students without any misleading information.

We apologize for the misunderstanding.

I'm embarrassed to say it, but I did fall for his trick and gave him enough for the ""ticket""; I was headed to an appointment with my therapist I was late for and, as somebody who commutes using the Bolt Bus, felt sympathy for his ""problem.""

I’m currently a sophomore at a CC. I’m interested in applying to UW, but I’m not sure if it’s the right fit for me. I’m currently pre-med and intend to be a ecology major. I’ve done good in my science classes at cc. I still have to complete the physics and O chem series. I want to attend UW because of all the potential opportunities that it offers, and the fact that I want to apply to their medical school. My concern is how low the classes are curved. I’m used to the 94= A, 90= A-, and so forth. I don’t know if it’s worth to risk potential GPA for the opportunities, or if I should risk the opportunities for the better GPA at another university. The opportunities I’m talking about are research, networking, volunteering, and clubs. So my question is, based on what I’ve said, would it be the right fit for me? Is it hard to do well in the classes I’ve mentioned, as well as the upper division biology classes? Any input is much appreciated. "

I'm a prospective student for the Fall 2019 quarter and am looking to purse a history major. I have a couple questions if you can answer them:

Do you find the material difficult, engaging, fun, etc? What do you dislike most about the classes you take and what do you like the most?

What other classes are you taking or would you recommend someone to take to fill the 180 credit graduation requirement?

Do you have any criticisms of the UW History Dept.? Who are your favorite professors and what are your favorite classes?

How is the workload? This may be relative to every student, but how much work are you doing on average?

You see I thought I could take PHYS 121 in the fall and continue with PHYS 122 which is REQUIRED for my major in the spring. I had to take this winter quarter off due to a variety of financial and health reasons.

I thought this would work great until I tried to register. Somewhere in the fine print there is this one little catch. Priority registration is given to those who did the series last quarter. So instead of being able to register now I am going to have to wait until March 4th.

I have no clue what the odds are that phys 122 will fill up by March 4th but dayum this is extremely liable to mess me up quite a bit. Not only might I not get the class but I can’t fully solidify my schedule for quite some time.

I was just reading the comments over on the post about Vikram Jandhyala's suicide. While there were a lot people expressing condolences and grief, there were a couple of asshats who decided it was an appropriate time and place to spam aggravating bullshit, which PISSES me off. Unfortunately, this subreddit has a longstanding problem with these types of users, and while the worst offenders eventually get banned, in the interim they cause a lot of disruption here, and can always come back with new accounts.

With this in mind: the best way to deal with these users is to NOT ENGAGE. While it feels right to call people out on their bullshit, keep in mind that these type of people are just cynically looking for attention, and will keep baiting as long as people keep engaging. Getting a reaction is what they want– so don't provide them with that. Instead, ignore, downvote, and report them for spam.

Just because we make burgers and chicken strips as our part-time job does not mean that we are any less of a person than you. Yes, I understand that you ordered a burger five minutes before we closed, and yes, it is our mistake that we somehow missed your order. You should have received what you paid for. I fully acknowledge that. 

However, there is no reason for you to call us fucking retarded and exclaim that we don't know how to do our job. Have the awareness that 10 other people besides you ordered food, and that there is only two of us to prepare that food. Have the awareness that at any point in time you could have walked up and said something to us about your order. You yourself claimed that ""it wasn't even busy,"" so it would not have been an issue for you to ask us something, and yet you just chose to stand there. Nevertheless, we apologized and offered you a refund because we no longer had any burgers left to cook, and we had already started to clean to grill as it was 10 minutes past closing. Continuing to give attitude after the fact is not going to incentivize us to open back up and cook you a burger even if we had any. So next time, I hope that you are able to understand that mistakes happen, and that just because they do, you are not granted the authority to belittle someone else.

(Thoughts and update)",140,24,2019-04-04 09:33:28,"Here's a link to my original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/a7qyt2/my_hardship_withdrawal_was_declined/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

I'm feeling conflicted right now. On one hand, I should be overjoyed that my 3.2 gpa went back up to a 3.8. I feel competitive for medical school again, and fears of all my hard work going down the drain are now gone. But what was the cost? 

To recap, autumn quarter for me was a clsuterf*ck of being bounced from multiple medical specialties, facing the possibility of death, while also fearing for my future career. Low blood oxygen is something really scary to deal with especially when you have no clue why it's happening. 

This would have been difficult enough to deal with on its own and a declined hardship withdrawal was the last thing I needed for my sanity. Going to more doctor's visits to get paperwork, speaking to multiple advisors, and running around from office to office was the last thing I needed during recovery. Did everything turn out ok in the end? Sure.... maybe in the end. 

But the psychological stress of having to run through bureaucratic red tape in the midst of recovering from trauma was really hard on me. For others, I saw in comments of my previous post that people were getting appeals rejected as well. This was for things like death of a brother. It blows my mind.

MY TAKEAWAYS:
1. The hardship withdrawal process is way too confusing and unforgiving. 

Yes, reading and following instructions is important. But what if those instructions are scattered across multiple pages and departments? What if the population that would actually be doing this paperwork is one that is likely dazed, stressed, and exhausted? 

Speaking of confusing, before planning a hardship withdrawal, financial aid told me to wait in order to not have to pay back tuition, and a premed advisor told me that waiting for a hardship withdrawal would look better to medical schools than a regular withdrawal. Which leads to:

2. All the different departments of UW do not have a clear understanding of the hardship withdrawal process. 

Hall health and the counseling center have different advise than academic advisors, who have different ideas than the registrar. Financial aid seems to also have different opinions about what constitutes a hardship withdrawal. 

Multiple advisors told me that with my medical information, I'd be more than ok. My primary care provider thatvstuck with me throughout everything was horrified that someone in my condition could get rejected. Yet, the registrar got caught up on the part where ""if I knew I was sick, why didn't I withdraw before the deadline?"" 

Because many people told me to do otherwise.

3. There needs to be more clarity on where undergraduates go for support during the hardship withdrawal process. 

Can I sit with an advisor from the registrar to help me? Is there a paper checklist to download to clarify all the different branches you must reach out to? What documents do you need to provide and who do you turn them into? With how convoluted the process is, there ought to be someone specialized in guiding students through this. Or, at the very least, homogenize all advisors' understanding of what's required. 

Medically, I'm doing better, and I'm happy to have my grades fixed. I just worry about those who either didn't get theirs fixed, or will struggle with this process in the future. It has me wondering who I can talk to in order to try to implement some concrete solutions to the hardship withdrawal process. If the new system auto rejects most and sends them off to a panel of reviewers, why not just do all of them that way? If it's too much work to thoroughly review all of them, why are you sending off the majority of them to the appeal committee? I don't know. 

I just want to thank everyone that sent me kind words and advice. If you or someone you know is struggling with this and needs advice, my dms are open. I want to take what I learned from this fiasco and use it to prevent others from going through the same. I love all of you fellow Huskies that were along for the ride. &lt;3"

(a rant)",108,32,2019-04-09 08:27:44,"As an unofficial subreddit for the biggest university in Washington, and honestly considering its prestige as an R1 and emphasis on computing, I think this subreddit should have a more active users managing it. The Automoderator is currently more active than the human mods, who haven't been online or posted here in months. I don't blame those mods for the lack of participation or care toward this subreddit--maybe they were students who graduated already and have lost interest in supporting this area. Finding people to take over something you created is also challenging. Who can you trust? How do you know they'll do a good job? What if you make a mistake in who you choose? Maybe that's something they don't have the time or interest in putting an energy into figuring out.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, it kind of sucks that the top search for ""university of washington"" + ""subreddit"" is this sub. New students, ever in tune with new technology and social media, are probably looking for an online space for answers to questions, opportunities on campus, and groups of people to find that may or may not be facilitated better with better organization of this subreddit and integration with a Discord server. I mean, maybe I am completely wrong about all of this, and maybe this sub is fine as it is, and maybe I am just obsessed with technology in organization and communication  (I am, I study it). Nevertheless, I see online communities like this as having potential for leveraging networks in ways that make visible more opportunities to students who are interested in participating in events at their university and getting experience in research or helping out other research projects that other platforms like Facebook are not as great at doing. For example, you can have pseudonyms here to protect your identity

&amp;#x200B;

If the old mods see this and are looking for some propositions for what I think should change, here's a list:

* Sticky posts for upcoming campus opportunities like: research assistantships, participant recruitment, internships, colloquiums, job fairs, free food, etc.
* Integrate a Discord server with the subreddit. The Discord servers are going to be more active than here, but they may also generate new sticky posts as students / alumni / etc. bring up new events going on or new information students should have. Having that integration is easy---just include a link to it on the sidebar.
* If the old mods really don't want to participate here anymore, they should at some point make some active members new moderators to help facilitate the above propositions. It's still going to be a relatively low activity subreddit, but it doesn't have to also be an unmanaged low activity subreddit either. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope anyone who reads this takes my rant with a grain of salt. I'm one person who's been mostly lurking the subreddit for a few years. I don't really think the subreddit is in any danger to itself or doing things ""incorrectly"". I just think there could be some ways to make it better."

I have been struggling with what I believe is depression and/or anxiety. For a while, I couldn't see a therapist because my family was going through some financial hardships and I didn't have medical insurance. It was the worst around the time I was trying to get into my major (engineering). I thought everything would be okay once I got in, but it's been two quarters and I still don't feel good. This year, I started taking better care of myself and going to the gym regularly, eating healthier, and letting myself have fun and have a social life instead of being holed up in the library. It helped a lot, but there are still days when I just feel so sad, and stay in bed to cry and feel extremely overwhelmed for no reason. 

It comes and goes in waves, and I'm currently in one of those seasons where I'm just really going through it. I've stopped in multiple bathrooms today to cry and I really need help. I called Schmitz Hall, and they told me that the wait period for an appointment right now is 2 weeks. I looked for nearby therapists and a lot of them have expensive rates, and I'm not sure how to maneuver all of this. If someone has any experience finding a therapist, I would really love your insight. I don't know how to go about looking for one, and how to find one that will match my insurance coverage.

I’d like to present my solution to our problems:


Capacity constraints on tourism. Here’s how it works. 


To gain access to our beautiful campus for this wild week, a visitor must present one of the following at an entrance:

—A UW acceptance letter, because, let’s face it: a lack of common sense is at the root of most of the problems with the visitor influx (standing on trees, throwing garbage into news stands, letting toddlers crawl through the quad, I could go on...), and most of those who qualify to be boundless usually possess a decent amount of common sense. 

OR

—A $5 entrance fee, to help cover any damages that our trash-tossing, tree-wrecking friends may (and probably will) cause during their stay. We’ve got custodians to pay and trees to keep healthy! 

If we really wanted to commit to the capacity constraints idea, we’d require applications to see each of the trees, but that’s another story. 

It’s an impractical, impossible idea, and one that I spent too much time writing about, but hopefully it was at least a little entertaining. Happy Spring Quarter, Dawgs!"

After living in HFS gender neutral housing for two years it has apparently been decided that both my roommate and I aren't ""committed enough to the community"" anymore.

Sorry—*""community?""* Trying to pass their gender inclusive housing option off as some sort of community is total bullshit. My first year here I never laid eyes on a single other gender neutral room until I made friends with someone who I only later learned also was doing GNH, living in a different building. He didn't know of any other gender neutral rooms either.

Next year our two rooms decide to get an apartment together (oh look, we made our own community cause HFS didn't provide any). HFS staff tell us that there are no gender neutral apartments at all. We finally find someone who says we can get a gender neutral apartment in Mercer Court. (But no gender neutral rooms in Stevens Court). Fine. So we apply. Turns out if with GNH you don't get to do room selection. You get assigned somewhere and that's it. If you pick a different room it's a gendered room and it has to match whatever gender HFS thinks you are. We went into the HFS office to see what our options were and the guy says ""we can't *neuter* a room"" cause ""that's just how our system works."" So they have a bad system then. But then this year we meet someone who lives in GNH in Stevens Court! So I guess that was bullshit too.

So now if we stay with HFS we get assigned with some randos who haven't made any commitment of any sort at all. Not that non-GNH roommates are necessarily going to be assholes but there's certainly some peace of mind in knowing your roommates have made a commitment not to hate crime you.

1. Just because high school was easy and you never needed to study, LEARN HOW TO STUDY and ask for help beginning your first quarter
2. Don't hesitate to take a lower course load to focus on your well-being (and get use to course-difficulty)
3. Study in the summer and take winter off if you have Seasonal Affect Disorder
4. Take classes you know will be difficult at UW at community college during your quarter off (MATH, CSE, BIO, CHEM, etc.)
5. If you're broke, take advantage of the on-campus food bank and the food bank by Trader Joe's
6. Find study groups! They might motivate you and become a good place to make friends
7. Go to office hours!! Getting to know your professor and chat with superiors isn't only helpful academically, but socially (and maybe financially if you need letters of recommendation/reference)"

The deadline to drop or S/NS classes was last Sunday... at that time I was feeling better and I thought I would be able to pull through these last few weeks of the quarter. But now I don't know how I'll be able to survive. Everything has been seeming so overwhelming lately and I've reached the point where I can't handle it anymore. On Monday I skipped three out of my four classes just because I needed time to study for my upcoming exams. I'm so behind in nearly all of my classes—2 .5 weeks behind in physics because of not keeping up with readings and missing lecture for over a week, 1.5 weeks behind in engineering because of not studying and not understanding anything that was taught in lecture. 

&amp;#x200B;

The pace and rigor of all my classes has been picking up so much as the quarter finishes up. On top of everything that I need to catch up on for the past few weeks, I have to write a final paper for one of my classes, do a final presentation in another class, and keep up with the current homework and assignments for everything. The stress is unbearable at this point, and although I try my best to bottle up all of my emotions, I just can't take any of this anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because of all of this, it has caused a strain on my friendships and relationship. It's so hard to ask for help because I don't want to be an emotional burden to the people I care about. It's been so much to handle that I've just ended up pushing people away and distancing myself from many of my really close friends and friend groups. I can't be there for the people I care about when I can't even take care of my own health at this point, which makes me really disappointed in myself.

&amp;#x200B;

The stress is already unbearable right now nearing the end of midterms week, so I don't even know how I'll cope when dead week and finals comes around because the amount of work and studying I need to do will really ramp up, and so will the stress. It honestly feels like my stress levels have gradually been increasing at an exponential rate since fall quarter. And right now it feels like everything—my mental health, academics, grades, friendships— have all been falling apart.

&amp;#x200B;

 I just feel so burnt out at this point that I don't know how I'll be able to pull myself together in order to meet my academic goals this quarter. I just kept pushing myself more and more with how much I dedicate myself to classes and extracurriculars and friendships that I've reached my limit for how much I can accomplish in the time that I have. If my mental health was in good condition, than my 19 credit workload and involvement in 2 extracurriculars plus band would have all been manageable— but in this condition, my work ethic and productivity has diminished severely just because of how perpetually tired and burnt out I am. And as a result, my coping mechanisms for stress have become more and more dangerous and serious. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know what to do. I've given up on the hope that things will get better because in the future, once I get into my major and have to worry about a job or research, I'll only have more stress and responsibilities. No matter how much my friends try to help me and support me, it doesn't help. My family would never understand what I'm going through. Talking to people I care about only puts more of a strain on my friendships and relationship. Therapy hasn't even been successful in changing my habits in the long term. Taking a break to relax only makes me mad at myself for wasting time. It seems like there's no solutions at this point."

Starting in 2020, more Washington residents will be able to attend college for less money. For many, it will be free.

About 110,000 low-to median-income students will qualify for help each year, including adults who never got a degree and want to go to school. There will be no more financial-aid wait lists.

The changes come from a sweeping higher education bill that passed along with the Legislature’s budget last weekend, which will help families who make up to the state’s median income – just under $92,000 for a family of four. It has not yet been signed into law by Gov. Jay Inslee, who called on the Legislature to expand financial aid, but already, experts are calling it nationally significant."

As an h3h3 fan at the time, I thought it would be a good meme to go to the meeting and get a picture with the guy. I only went to this one meeting, again just to see the guest. Fast forward to today's drama with the bake sale.

&amp;#x200B;

My high school leadership teacher texted me asking why I supported the bake sale. Super confused I asked what he meant. He said he looked at the UW College of Republicans Facebook page and saw my face ""front and center"". As someone who is left-leaning and does not want to associate himself with this organization, I was pissed. They were using a picture from the event I went to last year (probably because it was the biggest turnout they ever got). Little did I know when they took the group picture that they would post it on their page to represent their organization. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am sure there are many other people that went to that event who are not a part of the organization. It feels like a huge breach of privacy to be using my face without my consent to represent a movement I disavow. The fact my high school teacher texted me wondering what was up with me is deeply concerning. I am sure I am not the only one affected and this is not okay. 

I messaged the Facebook page and asked that they remove the picture, but I doubt that will do anything. Any advice on what to do would really be appreciated. And if anyone else could ask them to remove the picture I would appreciate it.  


TLDR: UW Republicans have a picture with me on their Facebook profile page. I do not want to be associated with them."

That’s alright. My aunt was a “C’s get degrees” person and now she’s a multi-millionaire. I know that might be a bit of an outlier, but everyone has different goals.  
  
I know for me I want to go to graduate school and stay in academia. For me it’s important to try my best to understand everything and spend quality time on my classes and research.  
  
For other people, maybe they just wanna get a degree and enter the industry. Maybe you don’t care about learning about physics for your CS degree. That’s alright.   
  
The idea of a weedout class is to make sure that you can face difficulty and move forward or to know that you’re dedicated enough to know how to succeed through it. Everyone is smart, but in different ways. I’m not going to say anything about whether weed outs are good or not, but this is what it is.  
  
Don’t forget who you are.  
  
Don’t forget to take help when you need it.  
  
It’s good to push yourself to be the best you can be, but only to the point of what’s worth it ***to you***. Wanna cruise though with a 2.5 and then go get a job and do it for the rest of your life? Cool. Wanna put everything into academics, sacrifice some free time and an extra 4-8 years of your life to do research, get 3.8+, go to grad school? Cool. Wanna drop out of UW, go to a vocational school, and do that instead? Cool.   
  
Just don’t give up.  
  
I remember wanting to become a doctor or an investment banker. Eventually I realized that having a family and putting everything I can into my family was what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to get a good job to take care of my future wife and kids and spend as much time with them as possible otherwise. I really wanted to become a doctor because I really like being able to help people. Finance and investment banking are what a few of my uncles are very successful doing and is also really interesting to me (also the pay hehehe). I felt like I could handle the challenge if I really pushed myself, but it wasn’t worth it to me.  
  
My mom had the chance to do many different things. All 6 of her sisters (my aunts of course) grew their careers to become millionaires or more. She chose to be a teacher. She’s happy, I’m happy, my sister’s happy. We’re not able to go on vacation all the time or buy super nice cars and houses, but this is good for us. I was jealous of my cousins sometimes, but I never wished or even thought about my parents having different careers.

In short: it’s reserved for *rare* cases where a student fails multiple classes. Though they reserve the right to rescind you for any reason, they will still send you a letter in the mail requesting an explanation from you if your grades are deemed “worthy” of one (what exactly that is goes by a case-by-case basis).

I mean, they can’t tell you anything concrete until they review your transcript, but things do happen, and they acknowledge that. Chances are you won’t get contacted about a C or even three, but multiple D’s and/or one F will most likely get you a letter in the mail.

Luckily, you always have the chance to explain yourself. Unless you don’t have a reason. Then you should be worried, fella’s. And if you have an F as a senior, definitely look into summer school and credit retrieval.

He wanted me to donate (cash only!) to some sort of job training/motivational speaking/magazine company thing to help innercity kids in Chicago. I could be wrong but it seemed 100% like a scam. When I said no thanks and tried to exit the conversation politely by telling him it wasn’t a good time, he became V E R Y hostile. He said “How is now not a good time when there are black children dying in Chicago” and then he started insisting that I probably call black people the n-word behind closed doors and how I’m racist, how I hate black children and might as well be on the streets shooting them up. While I’m not black and didn’t grow up in Southside Chicago, I actually am a POC who grew up in a rough neighborhood and I’m passionate about anti-racism.

I suffered from commons symptoms of depression such as loss of appetite, difficulty sleeping, feelings of helplessness/hopelessness, fatigue, thoughts of suicide, and sudden emotional outbursts.

The iSchool is woefully under prepared at teaching ""Data Science"".  
 

Don't believe me?  
 

Look at the classes you need to take to complete the Data Science track on the [iSchool website](https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/informatics/careers). There are only **FOUR** classes, none of which require you to take a STAT class after STAT221. Data science is all about applying statistics and machine-learning models to make sense of the giga, if not terabytes of data our world is generating. ""Oh, we'll learn about it in class""- except, you don't learn anything beyond what you already did in your 200/300 STAT class.

 

Professors are few and far between. Of those 4 classes, let's look at INFO474. Here's the INFO time schedule [AUT17](http://www.washington.edu/students/timeschd/AUT2017/info.html), [WIN18](http://www.washington.edu/students/timeschd/WIN2018/info.html), [SPR18](http://www.washington.edu/students/timeschd/SPR2018/info.html), [AUT18](http://www.washington.edu/students/timeschd/AUT2018/info.html), [WIN19](http://www.washington.edu/students/timeschd/WIN2019/info.html), and [SPR19](http://www.washington.edu/students/timeschd/SPR2019/info.html). INFO474, one of the four classes needed to complete the track- has only been offered once per year; and this year- it's being taught by new faculty who have never taught in academia before (my assumption is because the previous lecturer wasn't available). ""Surely the iSchool vets professors though, right?"". Here's a link to the CEC for the [INFO370](https://www.washington.edu/cec/i/INFO370B5078.html) class I took with Gregory Nelson, who loitered half an hour for students to show up (Every class) and all coding to an online platform. Complaints to the iSchool throughout the quarter did not improve things. Even now, INFO474, a class on data-visualization, is not teaching you on how to visualize data using tools like Tableau, and has D3- what your assignments and final project are going to be based on- tucked away to self learning. Class is spent learning principles of design you learned a year back in INFO360. (perhaps made worse when you realize your professor is regurgitating the exact slides and content from CSE512, but much less effectively.)

 

The lack of classes, coupled with how few times they offer it, and the faculty who teach it paints a red flag, atleast in my books, on the ""Data Science"" track offered my Informatics. It's bad enough there are only 4 classes towards this, but its made a lot worse when the professors in charge of teaching it are awful at teaching. This is going to go down a really unpopular opinion, but if you're joining Informatics to learn about data-science- don't- the school is not setup properly nor has the resources to teach you about it."

I went all-in for the past year only taking department requirements, getting nearly perfect grades. Now, I didn't get into either CS or INFO and have no clue what to do. I've looked into Applied Physics and GIS, but I'm aiming to be a Software Engineer post-college and obviously neither of those majors are the most direct way to get to the career I want. I do have a software engineering internship under my belt, which may help me get my foot in the door for future opportunities. However, many positions require a CS degree to even qualify. I'm currently leaning towards Applied Physics, but am open to GIS if needed.

I applied to SPU and was admitted to their CS program, still waiting on a decision from UW Bothell. I'm from out-of-state and been paying exorbitant amounts of money for tuition and have the requirements for both Info and Math Minors, so I would prefer to stay at Seattle to keep those, but obviously a major is a priority over a minor. Being here for 3 years, I've definitely made a home for myself and love the school (besides the major system) and would hate to leave it. All these rejections have definitely taken a depressing mental toll on me, and at this point, I'm just completely lost. 

Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated, I don't trust UW advisors after what Info told me. 

P.S. Let this serve as a warning to any prospective UW freshmen, if you aren't directly admitted to your desired major, **\*DO NOT\*** come here"

I'd like to say I can blame UW for this like a lot of people do on this sub, but honestly? My heart wasn't in it. If I really wanted it I would have found the passion to study harder, the interest to retain the material better. That scares me though because being honest with myself my heart isn't really in anything. I feel like I have no passion. And I don't do well in my classes unless I have a clear long term goal that I'm working towards and am fully committed to, turns out I never had that anyway. Sorry for the angry rant. I'm just really frustrated with myself and thought there might be people here who understand what I'm going through.

I joined center table as a student assistant (dining, dishing, and server) last quarter. Few days ago one of the managers told me that I cannot work in center table anymore because **a customer was complaining about me for ""speaking another language during working, and show rude when customers ask for more food.""** Since there is only me in the serving station at that time, **there is no one can help me and speak for me (also only I and few managers know this), and also the complaining customer has no evidence.** 

I am an international student here in UW, I am still learning English. I ll say I have accent when I speak English but I can remember every dish name and I know what my customers want. There is no reason for me to be rude for customers because I like center table and all customers so much since this is my first job in my life. I like every chief, and also the manager, John, even though every one think he is a little bit serious. But now I have to leave this place forever just because an anonymous customer said I am rude. 

It is my first job, and it is also my first time to be fired by a no-evidence-complaint. I even do not know how to explain this to my parents because I don‘t have income. 

I also wish everyone working in center table/people are going to center table, please treat every customer like your friend, or even better, at least I did, and I still got fired...

Also, please me some advice about how to find other on-campus jobs, thank you all."

These actions seem appalling to me.  But, I am cognizant that my news sources are biased in favor of the United States and Western Europe.  And I also realize my view of the world would be very different from the view of somebody that grew up in main-land China.

So, I am wondering how Chinese students here at UW view the action of their government.  Do you think the Chinese government is justified in their actions?  Do you think the media in the USA and Western Europe is being untruthful in their coverage of the events in Xinjiang and Hong Kong?  Do you think, as the Chinese government claims, that the United States is instigating the protests in Hong Kong? (it certainly wouldn't be the 1st time the USA has meddled in the politics of a foreign country).  Also, has your view of the United States' Government or its people changed since you've been living in the USA?

I am really curious to get the perspective of some Chinese students.  So, I hope some of them see this post and take the time to reply."

Thank you to everyone who upvoted and commented on my original post.
I have been reunited with my bike! I truly believed my bike had been chopped.

A Bike Index user alerted me about seeing my bike on OfferUp 35 minutes after it had been posted! I contacted the Seattle PD non-emergency line, where I was instructed to meet the “seller” and wait for a squad car to meet me five blocks away. It took 3 and half hours for a squad car to come but the thieves still came with my bike. 
In fact, they had another bike that they ditched when they saw the police (**a blue cannonade road bike** if I recall) Seattle PD is attempting to the find the owner. 

A few lessons learned:
* Go write your serial number down right now. 
* A hacksaw does not care how expensive your u-lock is. 
* Bike Index is legit. Register your bike. 

Anyway thank you for everything."

Look no further than Unite UW!,44,22,2019-08-07 17:43:32,"I know what you're thinking. This is probably just some shameless self-promotion of a club. But no, it isn't. I'm posting on Reddit today to talk about a life-changing experience that I had throughout my first year at UW. And that is what Unite UW is. 

Maybe you've seen our advertisements around campus, maybe you were at the Uniters of UW photojournalism event in the HUB (if so, my username may be familiar), 

This amazing program has been one of the most intellectually and personally stimulating experiences I have gotten in life. It's an on-campus cultural exchange program, run by the Office of Student Life. The program aims to engage students in quarter-long cultural exchanges (through weekly meetings, bi-weekly hangouts, and a big retreat during week 3/4 of the quarter) to enhance global understanding, overcome barriers and boundaries, inspire lasting international relationships and ultimately unify the experiences of domestic and international students at UW. I've gained so many beneficial people skills from participating in the program, I was able to be my genuine self for the first time, while also feeling safe and accepted by everyone, and made a ton of amazing friendships along the way.

This past year, I was pretty depressed. A mix of personal problems in my life and harassment/death threats experienced at UW. I tried to commit suicide twice, ending up in a hospital for hurting myself the second time - but there was always something positive that stopped me from doing so. I reached out to all of the friends I've made throughout two quarters of participation in the program, and still do so that they can understand my progress through the insane journey that is my mental health. Unite UW is more than just a club or a group of friends, it's a family. A family that does what families do best - care about others.

And I don't regret signing up for Unite UW.  The people there encouraged me to continue being as outgoing, positive and friendly as I am, had me understand that it’s okay to be not okay, were there for me and inspired me to have the increasing desire of being there for others.

Most importantly, everyone made their best effort in making people feel like they belonged. And it worked.

If you have any interest in the program, you can message me or discuss it/ask questions on this post.

### Really Competitive
Computer Engineering - 27%

### Competitive
Bio-Engineering - 57%
Aeronautical &amp; Astronautical Engineering - 61%
Mechanical Engineering - 61%

### Not-so Competitive
Human-Centered Design &amp; Engineering - 97%
Chemical Engineering - 107%
Materials Science &amp; Engineering - 118%
Electrical Engineering - 126%
Civil Engineering - 127%
Environmental Engineering 129%
Industrial Engineering - 133%

**Note: These are not the exact acceptance rates. The acceptances rates are equal to or lower for each.**

#### My takeaways:
UW has basically made it so 7 of the 11 engineering majors are not competitive anymore.
For future engineers who are considering coming to UW, they should only be worried if they are attempting to get into ME, AA, BioE, or CE. Overall I think this system is *much much much better than the old one*, so I have to give a lot of credit to UW. Way fewer people get screwed over by the new system, so I think they got this right. Obviously, it's not perfect, but I doubt it ever will be."

Yesterday, on my way back from Trader Joe’s a homeless man high off who knows what, masterbated  in front of me.....at 9AM. A few weeks ago there were stabbings on the Ave. Before that, my friend got a knife pulled on him while walking home. Last year, one of my closest friends (an extremely fit/strong man) was jumped and beaten up pretty bad. When I hold my girlfriends hand in public (off campus) often we get catcalled, asked to kiss, people touch themselves...(we’re lesbians). 

I’m tired of clutching my pepper spray every time I walk on the Ave or anywhere in the U-District. I’m tired of feeling scared when my friends or loved ones go out late at night. I’m tired of not feeling safe.

I’m from another major city, and our homeless population and crime was no where near this prominent. As a naive freshmen, I desperately wanted to move to Seattle after graduation. Now that I’m in my junior year of college, I no longer hold this idea close to me.

I know I may sound like a brat or ignorant to the fact that this happens in other cities. But I’m overwhelmed and tired and scared to go out. I’m sure some other people here feel this way.

If you’re an incoming student, I’m sorry to say that this is a part of UW and the U-District no one warned me about. So they probably didn’t warn you.

And after all of that fucking chaos, they hand me 3 flyers and on their way. Invading my privacy for flyers? Wtf? Why not just slide it under the door.

Basically, is this a normal thing to happen in college dorms? It just seems so unessescarily intense and invasive."

I have to get it shipped to me because my insurance only allows me to fill at specific pharmacies, none of which are nearby.

The medication arrived Friday and still has not gotten to me. Now I have 2 more days before this is an emergency but I don’t know when to start making a fuss. At this point I am just scared.

I am so fed up with HFS and this just adds to it. Like I went to the package room (temporarily in Stevens court) and there was one person working it and in addition to dealing with a line of people picking up packages. He was also the person in charge of sorting multiple bins of unsorted packages.

I am just not sure if I can count on HFS to get me my medicine in time....

So I guess my question is, I know they covered their butts with the whole “it may take over 24 hours to get packages to students” thing but how can I make them get their shit together and hire some more people to make packages happen? 

If my medication doesn’t come in time what am I supposed to do? Are they allowed to do this? Do I sue?"

www.techinternship.io

It’s a [web app](www.techinternship.io) for helping students find and apply to summer 2020 tech internships. It has a database of hundreds of open internships with links directly to them.
It also has a lot of data like location and compensation (some of it is user generated and will grow as more people hopefully use it).

I’m not making any money off of this and will always keep it free for students to use. I want to help ease the grueling and stressful process of applying to tons of internships which I’ve been through many times myself. 

I hope you all enjoy it, and I hope it saves everybody a lot of time in applying to internships!

I had an abusive family member come back into my life after 4 years and it triggered a lot of anxieties and suicidal ideation. I had trouble eating and sleeping, and just was so anxiety-ridden. It really impacted my performance this quarter. I saw a counselor on duty at Schmitz 5 days before the drop deadline and was fully intending on roughing it out and finishing the quarter. Dropping didn't even occur to me. Things escalated and I had a visit to Hall Health after all possible drop deadlines, and two days later, I was admitted into the ER for severe suicidal ideation (this was two days before my finals). The social worker that I talked to discharged me later that day, but said that I should not return to school. He only wrote me an excuse note (the ones that say ""this student is excused from this day until this day,"" nothing that specifies what I was going through specifically.) 

I went to see my primary care physician and she filled out the hardship withdrawal form for me and so I submitted that along with my response and I recently got my email saying that it was denied. 

My physician has agreed to write me a letter, but she doesn't know if it will be helpful because I saw her after Summer Quarter and I recounted my experiences at Schmitz, Hall Health, and the ER to her. I tried to call the ER department and it turns out the social worker was a per diem employee (who also happens to be still in school) and they do not know how to contact him. I could try to call the physician who saw me at the ER, but I barely talked to him -- only the social worker and the nurse. 

Should I try and get in contact with the nurse who saw me in the ER to supplement my petition? One of the student supervisors said that they would write me a letter, but I don't know how much grounds the committee would evaluate that on since they are not a healthcare provider. 

I have scheduled an appointment with Amanda Myhre, but I am so incredibly anxious about this and frankly, this has brought up more suicidal ideation. (On MyUWHome, my GPA for all 4 classes that I took are literally 0.0 so I am... extremely distraught...... to say the least....) 

Any advice/next steps to take regarding this would be great."

-You should clean the toilet up if you piss or shit on the seat of the toilet 

-You should make sure the toilet flushes when you're done using it

-Remember that the toilet you're using was made to be used multiple times by multiple people, not removed by a hazmat unit after each time you aim for literally everything except the bowl

-If you're from a culture where bathroom culture is different than here in Seattle, it's your responsibility to learn what's appropriate here. It shouldn't be my responsibility to dodge your shit on the floor when I walk into a bathroom stall

-A person should be able to expect to walk into a bathroom with five stalls in it and find one without shit everywhere

I thought about ringing the call button and making a big commotion. Instead, I just decided to sit down and hope to God somebody would use the elevator from downstairs so that the doors would open. I heard the elevator to my left move up and down a few times, but mine wouldn't go. I was scared.

It took what felt like 2 hours but what actually was only around 20 minutes for my elevator to finally move down to the 2nd floor and open.

so I got a lot of replies and messages of people showing interest in having a get together, which is awesome! :)for those asking, it’s definitely still happening. here are the tentative details but if I get feedback of people wanting something to change, it’s flexible! 

When: Saturday October 19th at 8:00 pm

Where: Pacific Sunrise apartments (to the right of Greek row, above north campus dorms) for safety reasons I’m not putting a specific building/room number on here, but if you’d like to come, shoot me a message 20-30 min before getting here and I will come down and get you. 

Why: to have a fun night and meet some new friends, and go a lil crazy. and most of all, cause why not? 

Other details: 
- Our apartment is decent sized but definitely not enough to accommodate everyone who responded. If anyone else has a larger space that they’d like to host in, message me! As of now though, we’re going on a first come first serve basis, and we will probably cap it at 20-30 people. 
- If you’re willing to pitch a little bit, we are going to buy a decent amount of alcohol. But in general, it will be BYOA, and anything else you want to bring. 

I have no idea if this is going to be a total bust or not, but we won’t know until we try! Either way, it will certainly be interesting haha. Can’t wait to see ya!"

So it seems like everyone is too busy to get in or even try out a relationship. So... I decided to make a significant other application, because I'd really like someone to cuddle with. That's right ladies and gentlemen and captains, I'm pretty bisexual.

About me for some interest:

I'm 18 and intended major is business and philosophy. Has the freshman 15 affected me? I think like 7 pounds. I really enjoy going outdoors, water color painting, photography, late night conversations about life and philosophy, impromptu adventures, cuddling, reading books (please read the great library series now), tennis, water balloon fights, slow dances when no one is watching, the color blue, sprinkles on cupcakes, walking at night, fluffy blankets, listening to music (into rnb right now, check out ""easily"" by bruno major), baking and cooking, h\*lding h\*ands, and more but I can't think of them.

Pros:

* I will bring stuff to you if you're sick
* I'm a great listener
* I'm pretty social
* We can study side by side
* Titties

Cons

* I dont know how to pick locks
* My feet get cold
* I will wear your clothes if give permission
* I speak whatever is on my mind. However, I'm trying to be more nicer and think twice.
* Chubby cheeks

Reminders: 

This is a capacity constant position. If you can't get in, we can be friends (infomatics).

dqaqmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/dqaqmk/uw_tacoma_computer_science/,UW Tacoma Computer Science,23,30,2019-11-01 14:30:39,"Hello everyone! This sub is mostly for UW Seattle content, and I often contribute to memes or stories or whatever about UW Seattle because I was a student there for a few years. But I'm currently at UW Tacoma for computer science and I often get asked tons of questions about UW Tacoma and their CS program in particular because there is no real mention of UW Tacoma online! So with this post I just thought I'd share my thoughts. 

TL;DR: Go to UW Seattle for Computer Science unless you are incredibly ambitious and able to take *full* advantage of UW Tacoma's resources. Also I'm bolding some words if you want to scan the concepts. 

UW Tacoma has some really great aspects and some really terrible aspects, the CS department in particular is no exception!

PROS:

* **Small class sizes**. Every class is about 30 people save 1 or 2 senior level requirements which can go up to 60-70. You work directly with your instructor in each class session, and if you ever have questions you're expected to be able to reach them at any time for whatever help. 

* A few very **good professors**. There are several specific faculty members at UW Tacoma that are an absolute joy to take a class from; they teach their material extraordinarily well while keeping nearly all students willingly engaged in each lecture. There are about 3-4 that I wish could teach classes to the whole world because of their teaching ability. 

* The school is **built for commuters**, so you can easily schedule your classes such that you only have T/Th days on campus or M/W(/F) etc. 

* Great on campus **resources** for computer science students, such as 2 credit seminars (TSS 390) each quarter which go further into detail on principles of object oriented design or algorithms design or other specific subjects to be taken in tandem with the main class on the subject, and an open cs computer lab staffed at all times with a student mentor who should be considered a subject matter expert with any coursework you're going through as a cs student. Things like these workshops and the 24/7 lab with a mentor are invaluable to students learning computer science for the first time. 

* Ability to do **projects and research with professors** you've directly worked with in classes. Nearly every professor here has a side project or research subject they're working on, and if you do well in their class you can ask to assist in their research or project. The **little opportunities** here **feel endless** and very approachable, unlike a place like Seattle which may feel more closed off from that sort of personal request for a research position etc. You don't apply to assist with a project here, you **just ask** and chances are you're the only one who even thought to ask. 

*  UW Tacoma is **cheaper** to attend than UW Seattle. The food and housing near campus is much more affordable than at the Seattle campus. 

* CSS (Computer Science and Systems) as a **major is easy to get into**. If you have even slightly good grades (2.5 min but 3.0 is fine), you will be admitted to this program. No bs get 3.9+ in CSE142 to have a chance at getting in if you ace your other classes. 

* Part of why the major is easy to get into, is the program is still growing. Each year there's another change to improve the structure of learning each subject and I think all the changes I've seen have been positive. And as a growing program that's still not large, you **aren't expected to know any computer science going into the program**, or really need to do anything outside of the classes to succeed in the classes. Maybe that last sentence should go a bullet above but whatever. 

UW Tacoma is good for the ambitious students because they're able to take advantage of each of the opportunities available to full effect. That's by far the best pro, unless class size matters more to you. If you don't plan on taking advantage of all the little opportunities, don't come here if you have the option, because we're about to see all the cons:

CONS:

* Bad professors will sometimes give solid passing grades to students who aren't learning. This may sound like a pro, but you can do okay in subjects and not really be learning anything and moving on through the degree requirements without ever retaining anything. Some students to on ratemyprofessor and find the easiest person each quarter and take that instructor and end up with Bs without learning, which leads me to my next point.

* Sometimes in senior classes you're interacting with people who possibly shouldn't be there. This one sounds incredibly pretentious, but occasionally I'll be talking a student through a problem and they'll fundamentally misunderstand foundational knowledge going into the problem, and I blame their past professors for that. 

* There is **no student life** at UW Tacoma. Being a commuter campus, most everyone goes to school for their classes, then leaves immediately after. Leaves as in drive away 20+ minutes to their house. Friends hang out after class and get lunch sometimes, but that's after you make the friends first. Building a good study group can be really important to your success, but it's not even close to as easy as it is at UW Seattle. We have the seattle freeze here, too, and it's harder because we don't all walk back to our rooms together and keep interacting for whatever reason outside of class. 

* **Stigma** with clarifying you're **not attending UW Seattle**. You can tell everyone at this school and in the outside world knows that Tacoma is not as good as Seattle, and everyone compares the two. It's not 24/7, but it's definitely a negatively contributing factor. You will be asked why you aren't just going to UW Seattle for CS by your neighbors and friends, and you should probably have an answer ready to reuse. Mine is ""I went there for a year or so but I didn't like living in the city and it was a bit to expensive for me, but I love the smaller class sizes at tacoma so it really works out"" or something to that effect. It's kind of annoying. 

* Lots of people that I know who graduate from UW Tacoma struggle to find a job (not limited to CS). I'm not sure if it's the school or the environment or a ton of coincidences or what, but it's something to consider - it's definitely easier to find a job with UW Seattle CS on your resume. 

Most significant negative is definitely the lack of student life, and I think I've even overcome that hurdle. Next worst thing is the stigma, but the first two points are lame as well. Not sure what to think about the jobs thing until I'm really affected and can get an inside look at that process and my thoughts/feelings. 

Again these are just my thoughts as a senior in this program who's been here for a bit.  I'm sure anyone at UW Tacoma who knows me could read this thread and know exactly who I am, and if that's the case then say hi! I'll be happy to answer any questions you have about UW Tacoma or UW Tacoma CSS, now or in a year or whenever. I'll probably link this thread as my thoughts when people ask in the future, and I'll also probably edit and adjust points as they become more or less relevant etc."

&amp;#x200B;

We invite you to come and check out our brand new brick and mortar store (our first one ever and located right in University Village) to pick up the $30 bucks for your pizza. We could only get the gift cards for MOD in person and so have to ask you to come pick them up, but...

&amp;#x200B;

While you are checking out our new location and picking up your Pizza dough, I managed to convince our team to snag 10 exclusive seat cushions (similar to these [https://purple.com/seatcushions](https://purple.com/seatcushions)), to take with you the next time you go see a Huskies game (or any other game) in person.

&amp;#x200B;

So if you are living in Seattle (or close enough to make it into our store) and planning to watch the game from home, then come by our store at **2623 NE University Village St** tomorrow (November 2, 2019) between 10:00am and 2:00pm to get your Pizza dough and free seat cushion.

&amp;#x200B;

PS.. In similar speakeasy fashion, make sure to say “Sleep Purple Wake Up Gold” when asking about your pizza dough and cushion.. There may be a bonus if you run around the store screaming it, painted in purple, with streamers behind you… maybe…

&amp;#x200B;

AND of course if you missed the pizza, feel free to stop by the new store and grab one of the free Purple seat cushions while supplies last."

First of all, I’ve always been a good student and have actually felt an intrinsic value of learning throughout my academic career. But recently, things have felt different at UW. I still love learning, but everything feels so much more materialistic. Everyone seems to be competing with each other for the same STEM degrees, and I find myself asking why, and how. Could there really be so many people so allegedly interested in all these STEM majors? Sure, they are very interesting, but it feels like majors like CS, EE, HCDE, etc. are so greatly desired because people just want a high paying salary later down the line.

This brings me to another point: why do I feel like I’m almost wasting my time with college? It seems as if I’m constantly hearing of individuals out there saying college isn’t for everyone, or even that it’s a waste of time, and that success comes from hard work, not necessarily a degree. I’m not saying a degree is useless, because if I weren’t at UW right now I couldn’t say I’d be doing anything better with my life, but I still feel like something’s not right, deep down.

I realize this post is semi-attention seeking, but I’m really just seeking advice. Is this feeling of “I’m just wasting my time here...I don’t want a 9-5 job 6 years from now...I can’t even figure out what my major should be” false? Is this just part of integrating myself into university life? Or should I question my existential state even further and eventually drop out and become a kermit. 

Anything helps, I’m just a freshman with a lot of questions."

I'm taking AMATH 482 (Computational Methods for Data Analysis) next quarter and have some questions that I was hoping people would be so kind as to answer:

1.  Are there any hidden prereqs for the class? I havent taken AMATH 481, and from what I understand 482 is a continuation of the 48x sequence even though 481 isnt listed as a prerequisite- is this true? 

2. Similar to the first question, is there something I should brush up on over the next couple weeks to prepare for the class? I havent taken a statistics class beyond AP Stat in high school (Stat 311), I feel generally strong in calculus, linear algebra, and diffy eqs but less so in MATH 324 content. My only knowledge of MATLAB comes from AMATH 301 (Beginning Scientific Computing), could this be problematic?

3. If I want to gain experience programming in another language (Python), would it be advisable to do homeworks in that language instead of MATLAB if I start the quarter with zero knowledge of that language?

4. How useful has this class been for you when applying to internships/labs/jobs etc?

5. What was the most difficult part of the class in your experience?

6. Any general tips for succeeding in the class?

I will be forever grateful to anyone who responds"

Aside from the fact that their last quarter at the UW will be online and they probably won't get to have a graduation ceremony, they're going to be looking for jobs in an economy that will be the worst since the 2007 financial crises (and quite possibly worse than that).  

There are numerous studies which show that those who graduated from college soon after the 2007 crises have lower salaries and higher unemployment than those who graduated just before the crises or multiple years after the crises.  I imagine the current situation will be similar.

The only (possible) upside I can see is that, if the economy really tanks and people begin to default on their mortgages, then home prices will go down and (if they get a job)  they might be able to afford a home in Seattle.

I’m hoping that this could be a be a bit of an advice column for current students to give advice for new students, unless that already exists in which can someone point me in its direction. Anyways, I just had a few questions that I wanted to ask:

Is it possible to get into campus apartments as a freshman? I don’t know exactly how UW organizes its housing applications nor if apartments are particularly competitive. If campus apartments are a possibility, are they worth it? I think I like the privacy of my own room, but will like the suite-style communal living space (I have looked over some of the floor plans on the HFS website).

So I was able to get into the engineering college—is the living/learning community worth it? I that I’m unsure what to expect of it, so if anyone from there wanted to comment that would be greatly appreciated.

I don’t think I am a frat person, but I also don’t know what the frats are like at UW? Are they the more stereotypical party frat, or what are they like?

Overall I don’t I would be a big fan of a dorm-like setup. I’m a pretty social person, but I do need some space to myself and also I can’t stand other people snoring, but for people who are similar and went with a two or three person dorm, how was it?

What buildings or types of housing should, at all costs, be avoided (if there are any).

I’ve heard a lot about the sketchiness of the Ave, but how bad is it and is west campus impacted by it that much?

What is some general advice for living on campus at Uw? Like, where a good places to eat, hang out, etc? What’s the social life like at UW? Are there a lot events? Is downtown Seattle accessible enough that UW students frequent it a lot? Any bits of advice help."

Not only this, but the moment you open it up, it takes 5 pictures of you. If your lighting is too poor, it won't let you continue and makes you turn on extra lights. If you have an extra monitor it makes you disconnect or disable the extra monitor. If you have other tabs open it forces you to close all your tabs (even though they have access to your screen). Also if you thought to use a VM to take your tests, forget it because it doesn't work inside a VM.

I'm not saying that UW should just eliminate all tests or whatever, but just that Proctorio is not the way to do it. At the very least, all of this is voided by the fact that you can cheat by. **EDIT: I previously listed a couple ways to cheat through Proctorio, but I decided to edit it out. I know that at least a few classes are probably using Proctorio and I don't want to share these methods with everyone and make those exams and quizzes unfair for the time being. My classes do not have exams. I am not using these methods.**

For in person tests, are we forced to strip naked to check for cheating? **There will always be a way to cheat or gain unfair advantages. The idea of test taking should be to do the best to provide a fair experience without invading on the test takers' privacy and security.** I know that there are many other ways to cheat when you're not physically there, but the fact that it's possible to cheat and gain that much of an advantage might be more telling of the quality of the test than anything else.

**Here are a few suggestions/alternatives from me:**

* **Take-home style exams**. This is maybe more suitable for higher level quantitative classes or creative classes where you don't get too much extra from having online resources. These are also best if either collaboration is allowed (must be careful so it's fair for everyone), or doesn't help much. The professor can upload an exam PDF or something like that at a certain time and then give students a certain amount of time to submit their answers (could be anywhere from 1 hour to 24 hours). This is nice since it's also good for those who don't have consistent internet access. I know some students in my classes who commonly have outages or live in an area where their internet is just slower and weaker.
* **Zoom proctoring.** Students can hop on a Zoom call with all TA's and professors (and potentially more proctors if necessary. The good thing about this is that professors can make announcements or corrections if necessary. There is still very much the possibility of cheating, but it's hopefully enough of a deterrent to make a generally fair test. The biggest thing is that it can help against collaboration which is arguably more dangerous than being able to use the internet (if the exams are designed well which is discussed below).
* **More focus on exam design.**
   * **Vocab Style Quizzes.** If you can look up an answer very easily on the internet, I personally don't think it's a very good thing to test on *unless* it is a time pressure kind of test. There are some cases where you should be able to know things quickly without having to look it up (like vocab words, important theory, etc). In those cases, time pressure canvas quizzes can be good. With time pressure, there isn't much help from trying to look things up since it takes too much time. **I also believe in multiple tries for these kinds of tests/quizzes.** The idea is to know these concepts and terms quickly. If these quizzes have multiple tries, it means that they can use the quiz to help them gauge their current level. If there are even just 2 tries, the student can take it once, realize that they aren't ready, study more, and then have an idea of what they need to know when they take it again. University should be especially focused on learning in a safe environment.
   * **Explanatory exams that evaluate understanding.** Terminology is good for communication, but it's only good if you understand what it actually means and how to use it. **It's actually pretty difficult to actually explain things that you don't understand well.** Professors can use this as a way to evaluate understanding. The hardest part is writing good questions, but good questions can make it very difficult to simply look up the answers. For example, if you ask ""*How does the sun generate its energy?""* that turns out to be a really easy question to just copy and paste into google and get an easy to understand response, that also might be not what the professor is looking for. If you instead ask ""*Explain the proton-proton chain. Where do the neutrinos, positrons, and gamma rays come from?""* You can look at the Wikipedia page for the proton-proton chain, but it will take a little while to process all of the necessary information. If you did learn it before, however, it's a very clear question with an easy answer. The main thing for professors to watch out for is not to ask questions about obscure edge cases that are barely covered in the class. **The question doesn't have to be about something super specific and obscure. The idea is for the questions to be hard to bullshit and easy to gauge students' understanding from.**

I'm lucky that all of my professors respected both privacy and fair grading, but we did try out many different things. I hope that some TAs and/or professors who don't have as much experience with technology and its risks can see this and make their courses as fair as possible."

g3g9sa,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/g3g9sa/uw_nursing_frustration/,UW Nursing Frustration,12,25,2020-04-17 19:57:01,"If any one here is thinking of applying to the nursing program at UW, or is on the fence, I just want to share with you my experience.

As we know, the University of Washington Bachelor's of Science in Nursing is a highly-ranked, competitive, high-quality program. In 2019, nearly 700 people applied. In 2020, nearly 600 applied. Each year, around 80 get into the program. This low acceptance rate is similar to many other programs at UW like Computer Science, Engineering etc. 

For those who are unaware, the nursing program requires above a 3.0 GPA, a list of required science courses with UW VLPA and I&amp;S requirements, at least 100 hours of direct patient care experience (nursing assistant, EMT, medical assistant, etc.), a letter of reccomendation from a supervisor, and a written essay. Of the 600 who applied, about 200 make it to the proctored essay, an hour-long essay about various patient care scenarios and 3 math questions. To select the cohort, they use all of these factors to whittle that 200 to 80 students. The apppication period is only once per year in mid January.

My first application had a GPA of 3.83, 400 hours healthcare experience, and a letter of recommendation from my manager. I took all of my prerequisites except for Microbiology at the UW Seattle campus (I took micro at a community college). While I will admit my first application in 2019 was not amazing, I was still invited to the proctored essay. I feel like I was pretty prepared for my second application in 2020. After finishing my prerequisites right after Winter 2019, I moved to a position in a hospital setting. I completely revamped my essay, got a letter of reccomendation from a Nurse Manager from my floor, had a GPA of 3.85 cumulative, volunteer experience, and over 1600 healthcare hours at both a memory care facility and an acute care setting at a hospital. I wrote a much better proctored essay in my opinion the second time around.  

Disappointingly, I was rejected the second time as well. Despite having a stellar application according to advisors I met with, I still did not do well enough to make it in. Perhaps my essay wasn't good enough or my letter of reccomendation was lacking or I didnt have enough leadership experience, I will never know. I am not trying to blame UW, the nursing admissions board, or other students that made it into the program. I am okay with being rejected as it is just a part of life you have to deal with. I am only trying to share my experience about just how difficult it is to get into this program. 

In addition to it being a very difficult program to get into, I actually stumbled into other roadblocks while trying to apply for other nursing programs.

After recieving my first rejection, I started applying to and researching other nursing programs at nearby community college. Somehow, despite being the preeminent public college in the Seattle metro area, two community colleges I talked to did not accept some of my prerequisites taken at UW due to the fact that UW's anatomy class does not contain a lab component (BIOL 118/119 was accepted, but these programs require a two course series for Anatomy+Physiology). In order to be able to apply for community college RN programs, I had to take Anatomy and Physiology 1 and 2 at a community college, even though I had already taken these courses at UW. I took these A+P 1 and 2 at a nearby community college and recieved 4.0 grades in both courses. I had an easier time getting high grades, had a closer connection with the professor, and paid less money for both courses than I did for a single class at UW. If I had first taken these classes and the rest of my prereqs at a community college, I could have applied to other nursing programs two quarters sooner and be closer to becoming a nurse.

In summary, for any prospective nursing students on this sub, I recommend that you really look at whether or not what you want is to become a nurse or to attend UW. Going to UW for your prerequisites limits your ability to get good grades due to grading curves, costs more, has large class sizes that make it difficult to connect with the professor, and makes you (at least in my experience) way too competitive with your fellow classmates due to the difficulty of getting admission into program. I have met people who are on their third attempt at the program and have not even considered other options. A coworker of mind told me her friend applied to the nursing program at UW 4(!) times before getting in. Getting your prerequisites done at a nearby community college like Central, North, Bellevue, South, etc. will give you not just a better chance at getting good grades for the UW nursing program, but also allow you to meet the requirements for other nursing programs around the state. These other programs include private schools like Seattle U and Seattle Pacific. I did not apply to these schools due to high tuition costs, but many of my classmates who were rejected from UW went to Seattle U as their second choice. Keep your mind and your options open when it comes to nursing programs. At the end of the day, no matter where you get your nursing degree from, you're still going to be cleaning up shit and dealing with asshole patients from time to time."

NOTE: I'm majoring in HCDE and my interests skew towards tech, psychology, and art

* **Pol S 201: Intro to Political Theory** \- a really interesting class where you read the theory behind different political systems like anarchism, socialism, communism, etc. The anarchism unit was the most interesting to me.
* **Psych 210: Human Sexuality** \- this is often referenced as an easy a class, but honestly I found it super interesting. It provides comprehensive sex ed and they had a transgender and intersex panel, a kink panel, and a polyamory panel. Babeland also came and did a sex toy giveaway. Great class, especially for people like me who were raised in a very catholic household and got no sex ed. 
* **Art 245: Concepts in Printmaking** \- take it with Claire if you can, she is hands down the best art professor I've had at UW. She is super supportive yet provides fantastic and actionable critique. 
* **Atms 111: Climate and Climate Change -** very interesting intro to climate science, take it with Dargan if you can (he sings different climate science themed songs on ukelele during class), and provides a lot of great facts for when you need to argue with your conservative relatives. The geoengineering unit was my fav
* **Art 253 &amp; 353: Ceramics** \- I just love making ceramics lol
* **Art 351: Furniture Design -** the professors weren't my fav BUT you literally get to build a chair and table from wood in a wood shop... it was so cool and i still use both pieces I made to this day
* **Envir 385: World Food Politics -** could be kind of boring at times however you learn so much interesting information about factory farming, the effects of globalism, and how intertwined petroleum is with the world food supply. One of my favorite papers we read was arguing that we should replace cows with bison because they're much more sustainable to raise. Super interesting content most of the time. 
* **HCDE 419: Concepts in HCI -** I heavily encourage anyone who is a tech major to take this class if they can (only if Kate Starbird is teaching it... I've heard mixed reviews on other professors). It's completely a theory class, but if you love theory like me, it's really heavy on the psychological and sociological effects of technology. We also have a whole unit on misinformation which was really interesting/relevant.
* **GWSS/PSYCH 357: Psychobiology of Women** \- a lot of work and very dense, don't get me wrong, but hands down one of the most fascinating classes I've taken at UW. It's a mix of learning about the anatomy and biology of women's bodies  but also about different sociological issues women face. Super super interesting.

gh45dt,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/gh45dt/an_alumnis_thoughts_on_the_dual_admissions_process/,An alumni’s thoughts on the dual admissions process,5,58,2020-05-10 09:06:04," In light of recent admission decisions coming out I can’t help but wonder why the University continues to have this “dual admissions” process. One would think that a public university like UW would be there to help people learn the skills that they need to achieve their career goals. This is, after all, an institution by the state partly funded by taxpayers so it should serve those who help fund it. However, students are paying tens of thousands of dollars and traveling halfway across the world just to get their dreams crushed. The only reason I can think of why the university works this way is because they like money and want to admit enough students to keep their pockets lined with cash. I can’t help but feel that the university sees undeclared undergrads as expendable as it reaps tuition money from their pockets. Of course, UW can market admitting many students as “giving opportunity” and that they want everybody to have a chance to graduate college, but the reality is much more cruel than that at UW.

I’m tired of hearing story after story of students being rejected, feeling not worthy, and settling for a major that they are clearly not enthusiastic about. I was almost one of those people. I had applied twice to my major (in engineering) and appealed two times before I finally got in. For context, I applied with multiple internships under my belt in industry and had multiple national awards and patents and was still rejected before going through an appeals process. I literally received a rejection letter from my major while my story and image were being used as promotional materials on the front page of the department’s website. I had sometimes doubted my skills, intellect, and career choice to become an engineer. The dual admissions process only shows that UW does not care about its students at all. I only got in because there were multiple professors “on the inside” that knew my story and saw me as a human being rather than a line on a spreadsheet. I am forever grateful for those professors but I don’t think I can ever be grateful for the system that UW has put in place. 

Sure, UW has tried to change for the better. At least in engineering they now have the DTC process but, in my opinion, this is a poor excuse of a solution. UW markets college as a time to explore your interests, but with DTC, the age in your life that you must know what you want to do becomes younger and younger. People who attend UW should only have to be admitted once - when they come in as freshmen. People should be able to study what they want and not have to be compared to their peers to fight for a limited number of places in a major. If you’re paying tuition and completing classes, you should earn the degree of your choice. Simple as that. [As mentioned by Amy Ko (Informatics Program Chair)](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/eitvrd/does_anybody_know_why_the_uw_has_a_competitive/), some states actually have laws that forbid capacity constrained majors. While she makes some good points about them potentially having very large class sizes, I think the solution is much simpler.

UW needs to admit less students to the university. UW continuously leads students on to think that college is a “time to explore your academic interests” but students are punished emotionally and financially for not knowing what they want to do in their life. I will always look back on my time at UW as incredibly stressful and I honestly wish I went elsewhere for my degree. I don’t want this for future Huskies. 

I’d like to know what your thoughts are on the system in place. Do you think capacity-constrained majors are a problem? Do you know anybody who has transferred out of UW or settled for an alternative major as a result of dual admissions?"
gkjnqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/gkjnqy/i_just_checked_the_grade_points_and_the_final/,I just checked the grade points and the final score for PHYS 123 and there's one thing I want to say: fuck,4,7,2020-05-15 16:08:29,"My grades for 121 and 122 are relatively good. Sure I can do better, but based on performance in that course, I would say I'm pretty satisfied and content. 

But this online class is a curse in disguise. My productivity is at all time low. I can't revise the topics effectively like I used to. Online exams makes me stressed up more than normal exams. I just got the email regarding the grade points and seems like I'm failing. Fuck.

Anyways yeah I felt like ranting here. Maybe it's about myself. I mean one could say online classes are easier as you have plenty of resources, especially during exams where you could just Google it, but I feel like not learning anything if I did like that. 

Well I finished my rants here. Do anyone else feel like this? I just need some mental support"

I submitted my exam at 10:56am but the due date for the exam was 10:55am. Now I'm getting a 15% penalty on my exam because I submitted my exam 1 minute late. I got really unlucky because I finished scanning my pages (I printed out the exam and wrote on it) at 10:53am and began uploading my pages to Gradescope at 10:54am, but my internet failed to cooperate with me since it took an unusually long time for my pages to submit. I had to refresh Gradescope a couple of times until my internet began to cooperate. The fact that my pages ended up being submitted at 10:56am was really heartbreaking. 

Not only that, but the exam was notoriously long (I don't know if anyone else felt the same way). I felt completely destroyed by this exam because I wasn't able to finish all 12 pages of the exam under the time limit (60 minutes, according to Dunford). At this point I'm expecting my GPA to drop really hard and the deadlines for S/NS and dropping the class had already passed (I was doing pretty decent in this class earlier this quarter). I was doing pretty decent in the ochem series (237 and 238) until this quarter came along and fucked up my discipline for studying.

Online classes are really shitty and I really hope that majors will pardon the horrible grades we get during this quarter. Quarantine is really getting on my nerves and it sucks how I can't separate school/work from home during this pandemic. My sleep schedule has gotten really fucked up (I've been going to sleep at sunrise for the past several weeks) and I feel like I'm not getting the full experience of going to college if I'm not physically going to my STEM classes in person. I don't know if I'll be able to function for the rest of the quarter, given that finals week is coming up in the next three weeks and my brain has been feeling dead since the first week of quarantine..."

Very lonely, few friends despite lots of attempts to get involved, and to be honest- I was a loser in high school who spent a lot of time hanging with my parents whenever I wasn’t invited out or doing an extracurricular. I guess you could say I missed them a lot. My roommate was really sweet, but she had a boyfriend who she hung out with a lot which is fine, we weren’t super close or anything. My boyfriend began working full time so I didn’t see too much from him either. 

Due to COVID, I moved back home to my parents. I left my anxiety about a lack of social life (at least now I have a reason for that), getting up at 5 am to go to work Fri-Sun, all of the extracurriculars I unnecessarily signed myself up for in Seattle. I was able to find deep comfort in being at home again, there was always someone to talk to since my dad works from home now, and I watch my favorite tv shows and chick flicks with my mom at night. I’m eating delicious, home made, and most importantly FREE food every day- and I get to enjoy it with the edibles my boyfriend is kind enough to covertly slip me. 

I’ve been really more put together lately. I struggled at UW with finding motivation to do anything that had to do with leaving my bed. I skipped each of my classes at least once a week, and while most teachers didn’t care and graded me on the quality of my work which gave me decent grades, I always had one teacher a quarter that made attendance a grade (Which I understand, I’m just absurdly lazy when I’m in the dumps). Being at home and being able to recharge in bed while also being able to do all of my schoolwork has been amazing for me. 

It’s so much easier to convince yourself to go to a lecture when I can go to the bathroom, stay in my jammies, and munch on some chips without bothering anyone else. I’ve been adamant on using my planner and it’s a bit of a reward every time I cross something off my list. I’ve been going on walks every day in the warm Cali evenings. This is probably a different view of school during quarantine but it seemed to be the break from work, activities, and social anxiety that I needed and it really paid off this quarter. Two 4.0s and a 3.8. This is my best and last quarter. See you at graduation, go dawgs!"

Despite covid, despite online classes, despite social ills impacting us right now, you've made a remarkable accomplishment despite 4 years of anxieties, frustrations, and challenges.

However you've also had 4 years of hopefully good memories, laughs, and accomplishments. Nothing will ever change the fact that you've accomplished so much!

To those who were omitted and feel alone...

You're not alone. I was the only person from my former high school (16 of us were graduating) who was mentioned at graduation this year, and even then, not where I was supposed to be. 

I was College of Arts and Sciences. For some reason, I was put with the random stragglers after the College of Social Work. I know that an online graduation is tough, but the 6 minutes where I felt embarrassed and angry that my name wasn't mentioned, at least when I still thought I was omitted? I can only imagine how everyone else feels, who weren't even misplaced as much as they were omitted. 

If we're still being told to have a weak cop out by joining the C/O '21, I'd hope that the Office of Ceremonies/UW at least try to do something to compensate. For many of us, this was one of the most important events of our lives thus far, and for others, a moment of pride. Through UW's and their contractor's gross incompetence, many people have felt hurt in times already tough.

To any graduates now, who were missed, I see you, and I'm so proud of you all for your achievements. Please, take your objective accomplishment, and continue to work for yourself and in making this world a better place.

I'm genuinely so proud of you all, and whilst employment, and life in general are far from ideal right now, tough times breed tough people, and tough people breed good times. As the cycle of life continues, know that as we continue, in our individual and societal pursuits, that we can and will build a future regardless of this one day, and this one year.

Congratulations to the Class of 2020! I wish you all the best.

P.S. In the event that the Office of Ceremonies/UW does nothing to compensate and celebrate those missed, is there something that we as students, and now alumni, can do to make things feel better?"

HFS has published a lot of information online, but hasn’t yet directly notified students of the current plans. I have compiled a list of the most important changes as of today, however, assume all of these changes to be tentative and subject to change based on the conditions of the pandemic.

I personally did RS, but I know my friends who took a lot of APs or just felt like fast tracking their education were also in the same boat as me for the items below. This may not be so helpful if you are a well informed individual who doesn't blunder headfirst through their life equipped only by the power of reddit, but we aren't all perfect.

**Internships**

For anyone who doesn't know, university recruiting for internships starts ***autumn*** quarter. Most bigger companies open applications 2-3 weeks before the first week of classes and autumn is for interviews and some [career fairs](https://www.engr.washington.edu/careercenter/career-events). I didn't realize this, and wasted my first recruiting season because of it.

If you're transferring or took a full course load from RS you'll be starting with junior class standing and you should apply to internships **your first quarter** as a junior. Even if you plan on graduating in more than 2 years, many companies won't even look at your resume if you say you are a freshman/sophomore so just say you're a junior if you have the credits to back it up.

Even if you're starting with sophomore class standing, spend your fall quarter hustling for internships. I barely even tried my first year because I felt I ""didn't have enough experience"" or that employers wouldn't consider me because I didn't have many UW classes on my transcript, but my peers who hit the ground running ended up much more prepared the following year and some got internships regardless.

**Research and RSOs**

If you want to do [research](https://new.expo.uw.edu/expo/opportunities) treat it like an internship and apply right away your first year, a lot of labs recruit on a quarterly basis so if you don't get anything at first, apply again a little after midterms.

[RSOs](https://huskylink.washington.edu/organizations) are the easiest way to make friends and bulk up your resume, especially if you join a project based club. If you're joining a competitive RSO, say you're a sophomore if you can get away with it. Some clubs will prefer to onboard freshmen/sophomores over juniors/seniors because they want to maximize long term members.

**Classes**

UW doesn't let you transfer more than 90 credits from another institution. I'm sure there are ways to get around this but I don't know anybody who has or has wanted to. There are also some weird rules about the last 90 credits towards a UW degree having to be matriculated credits  —  so if you want to take classes at CC on the side after you already have 90 credits, check with your major advisor before you waste your time and money.

If UW doesn't believe that you are making [satisfactory progress](https://registrar.washington.edu/course-registration/registration-policies/academic-satisfactory-progress/) towards a degree they'll put a hold on your registration. There are some pretty big distinctions between students who enter through the transfer vs. freshman application so I would read through it for all the caveats. In general, the university will flag you for satisfactory progress if you have not declared a major by the time you have

* 105 credits and 5 quarters at UW
* over 210 credits

If you have doubts about your foundation of knowledge for a weed out class and you have time in your graduation plan for it, just retake the class. UW classes are definitely harder than CC or AP so lunging for OChem with a shaky grasp of Gen Chem is a death sentence.

**Majors**

If you are starting in your major, then congratulations! It's always nice to check in with the advisors but you can probably just audit your degree on MyPlan and figure it out.

If not, schedule quarterly meetings with an advisor for your intended major(s). For each department, find an advisor you like and check back in with them every quarter. If you can't schedule time with the same advisor for whatever reason reach out via email and ask about additional hours. The major advisors are usually on the application review committee, and even if they aren't they know who is, so it's good to develop a relationship with them.

If you're coming in with a lot of credits and without a major **for the love of god do not burn through your prereqs**. Map out the minimum number of prerequisite classes you can take per quarter and still meet the application cycle deadlines and ace that shit. Focus on keeping your GPA high until you get into a major. A relatively easy academic schedule is fine as long as you keep your grades high, especially if it gives you time to do more extracurriculars/volunteering/leadership/projects. The last thing you want is to be stuck taking classes that don't make progress towards your major because you took them all your first quarter.

If you have a fair learning habit the number of credits per quarter really doesnt matter that much because you will handle the studying just fine and still have plenty of leisure time. And if you procrastinate even a mere 10 credit schedule will sure be hell for you. 

As for specific courses, you really shouldn't be affected by anything but your interest. Instead of looking for 'easy' credits, ask people about their experience with classes you want to take and maybe try them out for the first several weeks (and decided whether or not you'd like to continue), rather than shying away from decisions like that.

I transferred to UW in Winter 2019 from WWU after getting denied entry to their CS program due to having too many credits (they only allow freshman and sophomores to declare the major due to high demand).  I knew I had little chance at CSE, but I figured a 3.7+ would get me into at least one of the tech-related majors like CSE, INFO, ACMS or EE. Boy, was I wrong.

In my first year here, I ended up receiving a 3.78 in my prereqs and a 3.84 overall, with no grade lower than a 3.7. Despite this, I have been rejected (multiple times in some cases) by every competitive major that I applied to, including CSE, ACMS, INFO, EE and Math. I know that many students gunning for competitive majors have nothing but 3.9s and 4.0s, but I find it completely ridiculous that a student with a 3.7+ GPA, solid extracurriculars (an internship, a research position, and a club leadership position) and decent essays (that departmental advisors, writing center tutors, and major admits said were good) can get rejected by every single competitive major. I'm now a senior without a major, and my financial aid was just cut off because I have too many credits.

Maybe I'm just a whiny loser who should have worked harder to earn a higher GPA, but I feel like getting anything above 3.8 in a STEM weedout here is a complete crapshoot. You can memorize everything like the back of your hand and do practice problems until your fingers bleed, but all it takes is an insufficient explanation for 1-2 free response questions on a physics exam or a careless syntax error on a CSE final to lower your grade by .1-.2 GPA points, which can easily mean the difference between major acceptance and rejection. The fact that students pretty much need to be absolutely perfect their first few years here in order to study what they want is insane and pretty much unheard of at other schools. No wonder we have people jumping off the dorms every other quarter. Even at other competitive public schools with budget issues like Berkeley, anyone is allowed to study CS as long as their GPA is 3.3 or above.

I'm lucky to be pursuing a career in the tech industry, where you can still break into the field with an unrelated degree if you can code and have some relevant experience or projects. However, students who intend to pursue careers in fields where having a relevant degree is a hard requirement, such as engineering, are completely fucked over by this system.

I think that fixing the competitive major system should be the UW administration's first priority. I know that they're working with a limited budget, but, for God's sake, if they can spend millions on non-essentials like esports lounges, why can't they hire a few extra adjunct lecturers or TAs so that they can guarantee that anyone with \~3.5-3.7 or so can study what they want? If it's the limited classroom space that they're concerned about, why not teach some of the early majors-only courses online?

I will say that I applaud the move to DA by CSE and the College of Engineering. If you're going to reject me, do it before I've pissed away thousands of dollars and years of my life.

Anyway, sorry for the rant. I'm sure this sub has heard this a million times, but I'm just really pissed off and had to vent lol."

During this whole 2020 saga, the international community has also been actively helping to amplify voices of the oppressed. I love how when it’s our turn, people stood up for us. 

Most of us are afraid to speak up but I’m privileged to live in a place where freedom of speech is a human right. 

Big love, let’s continue fighting for each other. The international student community will always stand by you!❤️"

If students find themselves in this situation, they must leave the country or take alternative steps to maintain their nonimmigrant status such as a reduced course load or appropriate medical leave."

I'd love nothing more to earn a degree in Biology with graduate school ambitions, but I always wondered if I was smart enough to earn the high marks at UW to be competitive for them. I've thought of going to schools with less rigorous curriculum, but feel like a coward. My intention right now is to go to WSU, but it would make me so happy if I could go to UW instead and continue to be a strong academic student. I currently go to Bellevue College at the moment, have good grades (B+'s to A's) in classes such as Gen Chem, Physics, Bio, A&amp;P, Micro, and Calculus, however Bellevue is notorious for being an easy school and I wonder if even with my grades and what I learned, am I truly capable of striving at UW?

My real question is, what can I do from now until the application due date, to strengthen my chances of attending UW? I have one teacher who would be willing to write me a letter of recommendation, however it's not in one of my science classes. Perhaps I could reach out to one of my science teachers who could write one for me. But besides that, I work part time and go to school full time, and with COVID, I don't know how many opportunities are out there to earn field experience."

I recently graduated... during the pandemic. At first I thought it wouldn't be too bad, just getting a job and try to get into a routine. However, things turned otherwise. I just have a couple of questions:

1. **How did you deal with transitioning to full-time job?** I luckily got a 3-month internship which helps with the bills for the next couple of months, but this is also the first time I've ever worked truly full time 8-5 Mon-Fri. I think it's taking a toll on me: having only 6-8 hours left a day to do anything else that's not work, the rest is house chores, eating and cleaning. Socialization is nuked quite substantially, and when the weekend comes around, you're already too ""empty"" to know what to do with your time.
2. **How did you stay sane living with parents for the time being?** This is because of the job market and COVID. I really love the U-district and would rather work/live near there. I believe there's that transitory phase where you move back to your parents before you get a stable job and move out again. Without having my own car, nor wanting to ride the COVID-risky transit and that there's nothing nearby to do in the suburbs, I feel pretty confined. I have things around to keep me busy like books, or music learning, but those require motivation to do and I'd rather not force myself into it. Being around with my parents mean I can't talk comfortably with my friends online, nor can I consume edibles either. Alcohol is fine though, but that's a horrible drug.
3. **How did you maintain socialization with friends?** I think generally people have friends when they're at college, right? Right? And some likely are not in the same year as you, but different year, or they might not work in Seattle, or they move away for grad school. How did you deal with your social life essentially broken apart? I think this is more of a personal issue for me, as I don't deal with departures really well... And people say ""Oh you'll find friends at work"", but I don't see that happening. That, and the fact that I have 8 hours left a day to do anything else, is not helping maintaining/establishing socialization either. COVID exacerbates this.

All of this makes me really want to consider grad school or going back for another bachelor. But those generates different questions. At first, I thought that there's no way I'm doing grad school because I'd have to move away, but now the thought of starting it seems appealing..."

Most of that was ruined due to the pandemic. I don't have anyone at this university I keep in contact with, talking with people online honestly feels much more awkward than in real life.

I am weeks behind in my hardest class. I feel like I haven't accomplished anything with my college life and can't bring myself to do shit with this online stuff, so I'm scared of graduating with literally nothing to my name other than a degree and loans.

My dad got fired because of covid and took a 75% pay cut. Now my family is broke and I would have to take an additional $20,000 out in loans just to finish this (my sophmore) year. You can probably see that that isn't really possible. I'd be taking about $100k out in loans, if anyone would even give me that much, to graduate from the mechanical engineering department with my BS. Also, definitely not financially possible. So, I'm very likely going to have to drop out of UW. 

I talked with an advisor and she said it's unlikely I'll get any money at all from UW for financial help because I'm out of state (Oregon). I'll probably use some free credits I won in high school to take classes during winter and spring of this year, in addition to working, but I'm not really sure what I'll be able to do after that. I'm currently looking into transfer applications to other 4-year universities, but the only way I could afford to go to one is if they give me close to a full ride. Are there any contingencies where I can actually finish my degree at UW? I loved my time here last year for the two normal quarters and I'm really, really sad that it'll probably be the only two quarters I get to experience of UW.

She's also making full use of canvas to create groups, interactive/education modules and generally make the course more fun and interactive for students.

My grades, motivation, and overall ability to do school have all been steadily declining. 

Maybe I'll come back in a while, maybe I won't ever.
I'm not sure if I'm at peace with this choice yet, and I'm not sure if I've actually made the choice yet.

What I do know is that life can be hard. But you must listen to yourself and do whatever you want because in the grand scheme of things all that matters is how you view and love yourself. Other people's perceptions, societal expectations, none of that matters. 

All I want is to be happy again.

Best of luck to all."

1. How’s the course like? Like it’s a 50 Cred course so is the schedule very hectic?

2. How competitive is the admission really? I’m from undergrad CSE background with a little bit experience in ui/ux, Frontend dev, plus research work. What are the odds for my selection, in your opinion? 

3. What do the grad app review committee really look for in the application? Any points I should keep in mind?

I'm a freshman in honors and I'm seriously considering dropping it. Honors was not exactly like I expected it to be; instead, in a lot of ways, it feels like a waste of time bc I have already have AP credits. I know that the advantages of smaller class sizes is a big perk of honors, but with the fields I'm interested in (French and labor studies), it seems like that is less of a concern. Additionally, if I drop honors I could graduate earlier and take more classes that I'm actually interested in. However, I am concerned that dropping out will lower my chances of getting into grad school, scholarships, internships, and jobs. Does honors give you a significant advantage when applying for those things? I've also heard rumors that most people who go into honors end up dropping out? Is that true???"

I did worse on the second midterm (at least from the preliminary score) and I’m at a complete loss. Is there anything I can do to improve? Or is it too late? Or am I just really bad at physics?

It’s obvious from distributions from previous quarters that this class is incredibly tough. The distributions are not normal (some of them are even flat or left shifted) as one would expect: [https://www.dubhub.pub/phys114](https://www.dubhub.pub/phys114) .

After the first midterm Smith added 15 points to my exam for the curve. I don’t think anyone in the class did well on the first midterm.

I'd really like to see UW do what Purdue is currently doing. They have in-person classes with plexiglass screens for the students who want to come and the lectures are live-streamed for the students who prefer to stay at home. I don't really think it's likely and I have every reason to believe that UW will gleefully let us finish this disaster of a school year online, but I wish that there was a way for those of us who struggle a lot with online classes to advocate for ourselves and our needs. There is a pandemic and we do have to take some extreme precautions to protect ourselves and others, but I'm also paying good money to attend classes on my horrible WiFi connection and learn very little in the process.

Okay fine. Never was told the “500 words or less” essay was going to be weighted equal to my academics but whatever. I’ll try again next quarter. 

What isn’t okay is the advisor I just met up with who rolled their eyes and made faces at me while I tried to ask questions about the essay and what to do from here. They literally said “well what you said isn’t true bc I wouldn’t have done that.” They didn’t even say goodbye to me before I left the zoom, just sat there dumbfounded like I was an insane person. I’ve never been treated like this with an advisor before, it really blew my mind. They didn’t even give me any advise, just told me I had to contact someone else and I was wrong in my assumptions about admissions.

Someone told me about this registration method fall quarter of my sophomore year and i have always gotten all my classes since then on the first try (given that they had spaces open during my registration period). 

Step 1: Compile your classes and make sure that you meet all the requirements and what not. Also make sure it is not full by the time u get to register. (Good time to pull up the world clock as well that will show you the exact time with seconds)

Step 2: Pin that perfect schedule on myplan. It should now show up on the upper right corner under “pinned schedules” for you to adore. 

Step 3: Click the view/register button at about 5:55 or whenever you feel like it just make sure its a little bit before 6 am on your designated registration date. 

Step 4: Click next at the bottom right corner and then also click register. (It should take you to the SLN registration page and return an error message saying that your registration window has not opened. Keep this open and stay on the page)

Step 5: Look at the world clock and wait until it gets to the sweet spot (around 5:59.35ish). 

Step 6: Click the refresh button on your browser. (The SLN page with the error message. The webpage still has all ur classes you put in from step 4). You may get the same error message a couple times but just keep refreshing. 

Step 7: At a certain point the refresh will seem like its taking a bit longer. This is the key to stop refreshing and wait. Within a couple of seconds you should have gotten into your classes. 

Note* this has always worked for me and has gotten me into classes that only had &lt;5 spaces left. It may not work all the time but it sure does give you a better chance at getting in than the people still registering at exactly 6am. 

Also good idea to have open a another page with ur backups in case this fails."

Your patience and hard work will pay off. If you don’t get in, it’s really okay (I was rejected once, and reapplied a year later, CC transfer student here)

O’Dea seems to really know his shit and will answer the majority of the questions in chat throughly while also providing a lot of practice content for the class. What we’ve been learning in class has even made me consider switching my major to economics because I love what we’re learning.

And if you want to wind down after your race with some relaxed aviation, our commercially rated pilot members are rolling out a new Ground School in Husky Flying Club that will teach you HOW TO FLY! Real flight curriculum and practical aviation skills/maneuvers will be taught through our simulators! In addition, we are looking into getting HFC members LITERALLY into the Air flying once members join our Ground School.

Specifically for y'all engineering folks, if you're listed as [**ENGRUD**](https://www.engr.washington.edu/admission/freshman) then that's indicating you're not in a specific engineering major ***yet***, but are in DTC(direct to college) and will have to declare your specific branch of engineering later on. If you aren't listed as engrud, but want to be engineering, there's supposedly still a way into engineering. Check out the [Engineering DTC FAQ](https://www.engr.washington.edu/admission/directtocollege/faq) for info. FYI Computer Engineering is apparently no longer a part of the Engineering school's DTC, but rather a separate path called [DTM](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/admissions/direct).

Hope this helps while you are trying to decide on accepting your offer, and if any other UW students wanna chime in with info, please feel free.

But to be fair, I applied as a Public Health major so I’m not entirely surprised. I couldn’t take the SAT since all the testing centers in my area were closed.

&gt;PETITION: Solidarity with UAW 4121 Student Workers at UW  
&gt;  
&gt;At the University of Washington, Academic Student Employees teach the majority of student contact hours and carry out an enormous amount of research. Without us, UW would lack both critical operating revenue and academic prestige -- UW works because we do!  
  
&gt;  
&gt;But UW is falling behind its peers: our wages are well below average compared to peer schools, especially when adjusted for Seattle's cost of living. Student workers continue to report discrimination, harassment, and alienation from the UW community. And we continue to face poor access to mental healthcare, gender affirming care, childcare, and international student support.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;These are the issues we are bargaining over in our contract with UW, but despite their stated desire to address these issues, we're hearing the same tired talking points. The administration says there’s no money to give us competitive, living wages, despite their $8 billion budget. The administration says they can’t improve our healthcare, even though they saved money on our health plan last year. Our demands around equity and diversity continue to be sidelined. To win a fair contract, academic workers at UW are getting organized and pushing back, to show the UW administration that we mean business.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;And as a union we won't stop there, because our members are inseparable from the broader University and Seattle community. We must continue winning victories for tenants, like our local did in the Tax Amazon coalition. We need to defund the police and put them under community control, which our local supported by helping to kick SPD out of our MLK County Labor Council. In sum, we need a broad working class movement against cynical corporate politics, like those being pushed onto our community by the UW administration.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;To win a fair contract we need the solidarity of the University and Seattle communities, demanding that the UW administration bargain with us in good faith and meet our demands:  
 \- Fair and competitive wages so that UW can keep up with other schools and improve recruitment and retention of underrepresented ASEs!  
 \- Expand access to healthcare, including mental healthcare, gender affirming care, and reproductive care!  
 \- Expand our successful peer-to-peer EPIC anti-harassment training!  
 \- Establish a paid peer Equity Team to provide support for ASEs at the department level!  
 \- Improve mentorship for ASEs, establish the right to Individual Development Plans and a secondary mentor!  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Sign this petition to tell UW that you support our efforts, and RSVP to our online Rally for a Fair Contract, scheduled for Monday 4/26 at 12PM.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Solidarity!"

I'm so sorry to those who didn't get in; I hope that this post doesn't cause any more pain to those who were rejected from their goals. 

With that being said, I was researching math degrees and it's so confusing. You got BA in Math, Applied Math, ACMS, and CFRM. What's the difference between all of them?

I understand how a BS in Math would be different since it *seems* like it's math in its purest form, but a math BA seems like it's math being interdisciplinary, and that seems like the whole point of Applied Math, and Applied Math is different from ACMS even though ACMS is literally applied math in different fields with computing or something? And by that logic why is there CFRM? Can't you just get a quantitative finance degree in ACMS or do like some economics related field in applied math? If ACMS is using computers to solve math problems, then isn't that applied math with computing? Why would there be different degrees? WHAT IS GOING ON!??!

I'm sorry, I know I sound naïve as hell right now, I'm just really confused. Oh, and I didn't attend the student preview sessions because I got off the waitlist. Probably explains a lot lol. Happy 4/20 everyone!"

&amp;#x200B;

I plan to take Math 424, 425, and 441 this/next year and I was just wondering what would be the most optimized way to take these classes?

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking about taking Math 441 first since it seems like Math 424 could benefit from a pretty solid understanding of topology (definitely Math 425 will though). But I was also worried that Math 441 might rely on some topics from Math 424 (continuity, differentiation, integration) so I was also wondering if Math 327 is sufficient for fully understanding Math 441.

My point is, if you can’t keep going next quarter, don’t. The pandemic threw out whatever self or societal imposed timeline you have to follow. Do what makes you happy. Do what makes you feel healthy. Take care of yourself.

I only see a ""yes/no"" option for this, no ""no preference"" option.

That was my first class on proofs. I posted something here about not knowing what to do and some of you guys gave me a very helpful encouragement despite the fact that I realised my mistakes too late. I didn’t fail the class, but my grade was on the border. 

Come Winter, I took Math 327, that class still kicks my ass. Got a better grade, but probably because everyone was doing terribly.

Now finally, I’m in Math 424 last quarter. Had an amazing professor and TAs, worked super hard for it, and just saw that I got a 4.0 for this class! I would’ve never thought that I’ll be able to get that grade for an analysis class! It might be the homeworks that helps or the fact that everybody was not doing too well in that class, but I thought of sharing this anyway in case any one might find this helpful or motivating. 

Anyway, congrats peeps for your results! It’s been a tough year and you guys are great for making it!"

What's my best option if my goal is to get a job as a SWE at top companies in Seattle or SF? 

1. Go to UW Seattle and try to get into CSE or one of the good tech-related majors (ACMS, INFO, EE). Try to ace everything and have good ECs/essays to make myself as competitive as possible. Major in Math/Physics and take non-majors CS courses or transfer out if it doesn't work out.

2. Go to a community college, compete an associates in CS and reapply to 4-year schools as a transfer student. Probably my best chance at getting into UW CSE since they switched to mostly DAs. Easy 4.0s, so I probably have a decent shot at getting in as along as my essay is strong. Reapply to UWB and WWU as backups in case I don't get into UW CSE.  I can also apply to strong OOS schools like UMich, USC, UCs, UMaryland, etc and consider taking out loans for my last two years.

Your RAs are knowledgeable, but they're not the ones in control of the handbooks or websites. This is a collection of random tips I've accumulated in my time living at UW, and from friends of mine at UW and other colleges.  

&amp;#x200B;

DORM SUPPLIES:

&amp;#x200B;

***DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON OCM. I ASSUME HFS GETS A CUT OF SALES, BECAUSE THE PRODUCTS ARE GARBAGE.***

&amp;#x200B;

For bedding, look on amazon, there are tons of Twin XL (the size UW beds are) options there for far cheaper and with a better return policy than OCM (The company HFS shills for). Buy a pillow online, at Target, or bring one from home. I promise you they will be higher quality than OCM.

&amp;#x200B;

For towels, go to Target or, if you can, Costco. The towels at Costco are dirt cheap and VERY high quality. Buy two bath towels and a dish towel. You can buy a bath mat, but I would just dry off in the shower and save the $8. 

&amp;#x200B;

**For any kind of kitchenware, GO TO TARGET.** I was able to buy one bowl, one plate, one dish, one fork, one knife, and one spoon for cheap. I recommend bringing some kind of thermos or travel mug to fill up on the free coffee in the dining halls in the morning to avoid buying the exact same coffee at Starbucks for $5. 

&amp;#x200B;

Miscellaneous tips:

\-***DON'T BUY THE EXPENSIVE DINING PLAN.*** I was duped into thinking it was the best option before I set foot on campus (you've probably read the HFS guide saying that anything less than the level 4 will leave you without food half the time, that's complete bunk.) The food on campus is OK at best and very cheap. A meal costs around $8 at most, more with sides, so the $1100 or whatever the level 1 is plan will cover quite a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Additionally, you're in Seattle. You're a 10 minute walk or a 20 minute bus ride from some of the best food in the world. Don't waste all your college meals on a greasy sub-mcdonalds quality burger. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Your dining account can be used at the District Market (on-campus grocery store). I wouldn't use actual money here, as its almost all 10-40% more expensive than any other grocery store, but it's a good way to burn the money you won't want to use on junky fast food. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-**Amazon is your friend.** You will forget things. You will break things. You'll be living in Seattle so 90% of packages will be able to be delivered next day, or if you're really lucky, later the same day. If you don't have prime but your parents do, have them set up Amazon Household, which will give you access to free prime shipping.

&amp;#x200B;

\-**Bring batteries and lightbulbs.** These are both weirdly expensive around the University, so buy them and bring them.

&amp;#x200B;

\-**Lighting is a must.** The dorms can get really dark and depressing, especially in overcast Seattle winter, which is all of Seattle winter. I wouldn't necessarily go so far as to spend $50 on a ""mood lamp"", but some fairy lights, desk lamps, floor lamps, or, if you're so inclined and your roommate doesn't object (ASK FIRST) TikTok style LEDs.

&amp;#x200B;

\-On the same line as Lighting, **bring a plant**. Studies have repeatedly shown increased mood, energy, and focus in people who have leafy plants in their environments as compared to those who do not. Pothos, Lucky Bamboo, and Fiddleleaf Fig are all pretty cheap and easy to care for. Spend 10 minutes researching them so you don't kill them instantly and you'll be golden.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Laundry. Doesn't have to be Tide, but **any laundry pod is a lifesaver for dorm laundry.** You don't want to haul a 2 gallon jug of detergent up 5 flights of stairs (unless you're trying to get a leg workout in, in which case go for it). I have a collapsible hamper so I would often bring my laundry down with a pod or two, start it going,  put the hamper in my backpack, then go get lunch on the AVE.

&amp;#x200B;

\-**If you need a mini fridge, see if you can buy used.** I paid $50 on Facebook Marketplace for one that retails for $200. It's a little late now, but graduates often get rid of theirs at the end of the year. Facebook Marketplace is a great place to start looking. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-**Get a Coffee Maker / Electric Kettle.** Either of these will pay for themselves in a month if you drink a lot of Tea, Coffee, or Cocoa (also good for ramen).

&amp;#x200B;

If you're not sure if you'll need something or not, err on the side of conservativism. Dorms are small. You don't want to be like I was and have a bunch of storage bins full of junk I never used, or even wanted to use. Save your money on the front end, don't buy a rice cooker and a, instant pot and an air fryer and a frying pan and 50 other things ""just in case"". If you realize you need something, buy it on Amazon, or go to the store. If Seattle seems expensive, hop on a bus (if I recall correctly the 522 or the 255 will work) and go to Bellevue, Kirkland, or Redmond. On top of seeing more of the area if you're not from here, these towns can be much cheaper (also typically safer for walking alone but that's another issue for another post) than anywhere in Seattle, and unlimited bus fare is included in Tuition. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Off topic but maybe helpful bits of wisdom**

&amp;#x200B;

**-**I always keep a few $1 bills in a pocket with nothing else in it when I'm walking around. This way, if one of the many many beggars around the AVE or Seattle in general comes up and asks, or worse, demands money, I can hand them a small amount without pulling out my whole wallet or risking dropping stuff. You will be asked for money. Sometimes, you will be asked for money in a very forceful way. One wants to assume these are people down on their luck with the best intentions, but the reality is some are dangerous. **NEVER PULL OUT YOUR WALLET WHEN GIVING AN UNHOUSED PERSON OR BEGGAR MONEY.** Many are good people on bad times, some are not. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-This applies to anyone, but especially those who are women or minorities of any kind, and those who are less physically intimidating. **Avoid walking alone** off or near campus. The campus proper is fairly safe, but you go one street in any direction and all bets are off. Do not walk alone, do not walk with headphones on, and do not walk at night. Ensure bags are secure and closed. Probably, you'll never have a problem. Expect the best and plan for the worst. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-**Don't study in your dorm**. I could wax poetic about sleep hygiene all day but it boils down to this: Don't use spaces for all purposes. Sleep in your sleeping space, relax in your relaxation space, study in your study space. There are libraries for studying. They're very nice. Use them. You will be more productive, I promise.

&amp;#x200B;

\-**Find your people.** Don't rely on highschool friends alone for socialization in college. Join a club you're genuinely passionate about, not that you think would look cool to be in. Personally, I've made all my friends at UW through Dungeons and Dragons. Anything that forces groups of 3-6 people together to interact on any personal level will absolutely build relationships. I might make a whole other post about this later. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't set out with the intent to write this long of a post (In fact this was originally going to be a 1 paragraph psa about the dining level) but these are genuinely all things that if I had known going into college my first year I would have been much better off. Hopefully this will help at least one person with at least one thing and if it does, it was worth it. If you have any other tips (the real LPT is always in the comments) I'll add them to the list with credit. Feel free to repost or plagiarize any of this, if it would help more people know what they're doing."

p90teq,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/p90teq/prediction_online_is_happening_again/,Prediction: Online is Happening Again,4,85,2021-08-21 15:36:12,"I don't see any way in-person school could happen this year, even with vaccine mandates. 

Unfortunately, it's seeming more and more like while the vaccine is very effective at preventing illness from COVID, it doesn't (at least doesn't fully) prevent against TESTING POSITIVE for the virus. If this is the case, then fully in-person instruction will be difficult if not impossible.
 
Unless we lift or reduce quarantine requirements (which would be wild), people who test positive will be out of commission for at least two weeks, even if they have no symptoms. For students this means two weeks of no learning. For faculty, this means two weeks of no teaching. This is, obviously, catastrophic for in-person learning. Even if everyone is vaccinated and nobody gets sick, we could still feel severe effects of COVID transmission on campus. 

As such, at the very least an online option will be necessary. However at that point that means all classes must either be able to be taught simultaneously online and in person (which will basically amount to sitting in a zoom class in a lecture hall instead of at home) or each class must have two sections--one online and one on campus--that people will move in and out of as they get sick and recover (which will be a lot more work on UW and faculty's parts). 

The simple solution for UW here, then, is to just not reinvent the wheel: online class for all students. I expect UW, knowing they'll face mass drop-outs if they go back to the old system, will offer some kind of olive branch to soften the blow. Maybe open big lecture halls and libraries from which you can attend your zoom lectures (masked up, of course). Maybe offer more in-person events and labs. However, I don't see any way UW can logistically maintain in-person instruction any way short of sealing off campus entirely. People come from all over the world to attend UW, and sooner or later some of them will, vaccinated or not, contract and spread COVID. 

Even if we are all vaccinated (which, come on, the idea that people aren't lying on the attestation form is a fairytale) and nobody gets seriously sick, positive COVID tests will still force the university to accommodate online learning. 

I expect our situation will end up a lot like Rice University:  https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/568707-rice-university-announces-switch-to-online-classes-for-beginning-of?amp

I hope I'm wrong and we end up with a relatively uneventful in-person fall quarter. If I'm right I know I'm taking a gap quarter. No way in hell am I wasting another year online."

ptjlcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/ptjlcb/adviceguide_to_new_uw_students/,Advice/Guide to New UW Students,12,36,2021-09-22 17:28:23,"This is dedicated to people that want to maximize their college experience and either come from nothing and/or really just wanna run it up 💰Make the most of all the tuition you’re paying already lol might as well 🤷🏽‍♂️

I’m a senior my final quarter in UW CSE. I’m Mexican and my family EFC is $0 so I come from the bottom of the bottom. This has been the biggest advantage for me going into UW CSE, as I’ve found more doors opened for me than I could have ever dreamed of. I’m a grinder, so I spent so much time maximizing the resources here.

You're gonna meet the smartest people you've ever met in your life, and once you graduate you're gonna have connections to every big company all over the world. Here’s some of the things I’ve learned over my years here:

\*note this is especially helpful for CS/Info majors but doesn’t mean you can’t look into it too :)

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Social + Study**: Use the Pomodoro study technique or find something that works. Talk to as many people in your classes as you can, f\*\*\* being shy it'll pay off pretty hard early on you'll see. Make study groups whenever you can, a lot of people don't talk to each other especially in the beginning so just ask anyone to study w u and they'll almost always say yes. You can reserve some of the really nice study spaces around campus here (not all are open cuz COVID): [lib.washington.edu/services/spaces/study](http://lib.washington.edu/services/spaces/study). USE THE ACADEMIC SUPPORT PROGRAMS! Its free help from people that know their stuff that can get you through basically every intro class and well into your major: [academicsupport.washington.edu](http://academicsupport.washington.edu/).
2. **More Social:** There’s even a bowling alley, e-sports room, and arcade to hang out at: [hub.washington.edu/play](http://hub.washington.edu/play). Canoes and kayaks at the waterfront: [washington.edu/ima/waterfront/boat-rentals](http://washington.edu/ima/waterfront/boat-rentals). Explore the Ave w someone, find your fav food places.
3. **Fitness:** Go to the gym please. Don’t even have to go crazy hard, you’re already paying for it in tuition so go on the treadmill for 30min after class every day. You’ll be feeling amazing in no time. There’s an intermural sports leagues for anyone that wants to play a sport regularly but isn’t pro. There’s rock climbing, swimming, martial arts, yoga, archery, even a golf range, you name it they most likely got it: [washington.edu/ima](http://washington.edu/ima).
4. **Clubs**: There’s an insane amount of clubs so just spend a day going through this directory and find something that interests you: [huskylink.washington.edu](http://huskylink.washington.edu/).
5. **Health:** Use Hall Health’s resources. Schedule times during your quarter to talk to a psychologist, getting your mental on point is key to everything. You also get one FREE checkup per quarter. Also they got free condoms (stay safe y’all)!!
6. **Food:** There’s a really nice FREE(!!!) food pantry that every UW student get access to once a week: [washington.edu/anyhungryhusky/the-uw-food-pantry](http://washington.edu/anyhungryhusky/the-uw-food-pantry). You can also sign up for SNAP benefits (free money to spend on food every month) if you’re at least part time: [washington.edu/financialaid/types-of-aid/food-stamps](http://washington.edu/financialaid/types-of-aid/food-stamps).
7. **Electronics:** You don’t have to buy almost any electronic. You can rent really nice cameras (started me off on my pro photography journey), laptops, lighting equipment for potential YT channels or TikToks, calculators, tablets (including the new iPad Pro), speakers, projectors, mics, and even VR headsets. Allowed me to save up enough money until I could get my own (theres also student discounts at the Microsoft and Apple Store among others). I’m a computer expert so lmk if you need help buying something.
8. **Maker Space + Studio:** UW Maker Space ([hfs.uw.edu/The-Mill/maker-space](http://hfs.uw.edu/The-Mill/maker-space)) offers 3D printers, vinyl cutters, computers w free Adobe software, sewing and embroidery machines, and even circuit board stations among others. Between this and #8 you can literally start your own online company. There’s also a **music** **studio** w all the equipment you’d ever need to record songs or just mess around in. Pretty crazy.
9. **Credit Card:** Drop whatever you're doing and get a credit card (start once you’re 18), get this one its for people that don't have credit yet: [**discover.com/credit-cards/secured/**](http://discover.com/credit-cards/secured/)
10. **Coding\*:** Literally spend your free time on [**leetcode.com**](http://leetcode.com/) just practicing coding questions, the earlier you get an internship the easier it'll be to get future ones. Look through Harvard CS50's course to get a good start on fundamentals. Sign up for Dubhacks even if you don’t know s\*\*\*, I met a bunch of really cool juniors and seniors that guided me my first year even though I didn’t have experience: [dubhacks.co](http://dubhacks.co/). Also CS kids use the labs pls they have 4K monitors, nice ass chairs
11. **Research:** Find a field you're interested and find the contact info of faculty members and ask for research positions in their labs or w grad students they know. The earlier you do this the better but you might struggle to find a position early on, just keep trying.
12. **Student Jobs:** You can do work study and you'll get extra money every quarter (you can work up to the amount that's included in your award letter under the work study section), an example is working in Local Pointe. There's also jobs that are on campus but aren't work study, they're limited to UW students and its separate from work study so you don't need to have that offer in your aid letter to apply, an example is the Allen School Ambassador position.
13. **College Tax Credits**: American opportunity tax credit, can get extra money from the gov for two separate years during college (as long as you're full time), worth filing your taxes even if you don't have a job for this reason.
14. **Internships\*:** Find a list of freshman internships/opportunities on Reddit and apply to all of them, they're specially designed for people just starting college so you have a higher chance of getting in + you'll make dope ass people. Check out Microsoft New Tech especially I did that and it was a great experience.
15. **Financial Aid:** You can get enough financial aid/scholarships/grants that UW pays YOU every quarter for your expenses, I started off with $2k every quarter and got all the way to $6k/quarter. There’s a cap on this (I think 8k for in-state but I could be wrong), so apply to every scholarship that you can. APPLY TO EMERGENCY AID WHEN YOU’RE IN FINANCIAL NEED: [washington.edu/emergencyaid](http://washington.edu/emergencyaid) (will open when quarter starts, can usually apply a couple times a quarter).
16. **Investing:** Once you start making money start investing in the stock market, forget about spending it. Or spend it on niches/things that will retain value. I wasted a lot of it on video games and others that didn’t hold their value. If you play your cards right you could easily have 50k+ before you even graduate (I didn’t have loans). If you're interested in **options trading** check this video out: [**youtube.com/watch?v=SD7sw0bf1ms&amp;t=1588s**](http://youtube.com/watch?v=SD7sw0bf1ms&amp;t=1588s)
17. **License + Car:** Get a license even if you're not planning to get a car, it'll drop your insurance rates by hundreds when you got that 🔥 internship money to get one. Use Zipcar to get around Seattle, theres a discount for students so you don’t even need to get your own car.
18. **UW Student Discounts:** Here’s a website that lists all the discounts UW students receive: [thewholeu.uw.edu/tag/discounts/](http://thewholeu.uw.edu/tag/discounts/). You can go to the zoo for cheap and visit some of the museums around Seattle on a discount.
19. **Textbooks:** You don’t necessarily have to pay for textbooks (especially in your later classes), you can find plenty of links online just search Reddit. Some classes unfortunately tie their participation grade to online versions of the textbook so just take the L on those.
20. **Scholarships:** You can get scholarships for study abroad so you can basically go for free, checkout the Gilman Scholarship, also the Allen School has a lot of scholarships (some departments offer scholarships for in-major students, usually starts your second year as the application period is during the summer.
21. **AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, for everyone but especially the bros**: Up your fashion/general glow game i see too many damn people rocking sweats and tech t-shirts for all 4/5 years they’re at UW. Go to H&amp;M or Pacsun or literally any decent place at the mall, GET A BEARD by using minoxidil (i went from baby face to full facial hair) OR LEARN TO TRIM IT PLS get a Philips Norelco ($50), use teeth whitening strips, go to the dentist, (**GIRLS**wash your hair yes we can see the oil + fix your **anterior pelvic tilt** (Google)), look up videos on fixing your posture, use chapstick, PLS USE DEODORANT, find fashion YTers, cut your damn nails, get basic skin treatment products, go the barber at least every other month, get your eyebrows done, GET A TONGUE BRUSH, use floss, get separate body wash and shampoo (i’m looking at you Irish Spring 5000 in 1), get a Korean body scrubber or loofah (you’re welcome, no your hands are not enough it helps w body acne), get a nice perfume/cologne at Sephora, use moisturizer. I found all this info cuz i was sick of scrubbing, looks aren’t everything ofc but these are the basics and they’ll help get your confidence up.

Bonus: Apply to this [**foster.uw.edu/centers/buerk-ctr-entrepreneurship/undergraduate-entrepreneurship/lavin-entrepreneurship-program**](http://foster.uw.edu/centers/buerk-ctr-entrepreneurship/undergraduate-entrepreneurship/lavin-entrepreneurship-program), which is now OPEN and closes October 24th, its a program that lets you meet CEOs around the Seattle area and meet a bunch of amazing people, also consider doing the Entrepreneurship minor they give you money to make your own company.

This isn’t a definitive guide but it should help you navigate UW and set you up for success. Also don't drink too much alcohol it makes you sluggish and will decrease your physical wellbeing (I notice even one glass in the gym the next day) but remember to have every once in a while (finding a balance is key tbh you're prob gon struggle for your first few years w this).

As recently as last quarter I was an Allen School ambassador so I’d be down to schedule some relaxed office hours to answer any questions y’all have. Thanks and good luck y’all! DM me here or on IG if you have more questions: [instagram.com/geov.cas](http://instagram.com/geov.cas).

Edit: More bonus stuff, if you gotta gaming PC use it to mine Ethereum, or better yet look into crypto lending exchanges, you basically lend whatever crypto you own and earn interest off it. Look into registering an LLC and you can start your business credit score if you're ever thinking of opening up one in the future."

pqb5yp,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/pqb5yp/getting_10_credits_of_natural_science_for_cs/,Getting 10 Credits of Natural Science for CS degree is ridiculous at this school,1,1,2021-09-17 16:20:14,"I took BIOL 180 + Some 400 level BIOL and both classes were more work than any cs or math class I have ever taken at UW.

I took CSE 332 which I consider being the most time-intensive CSE class I've taken. CSE 332 was about 20 hours a week for me on average.

BIOL 180 was like 35-40 hours a week. Lectures 4 times a week, labs, practice exams that are graded weekly, daily quizzes, anki, double-column textbook required readings, etc.

And BIOL 180 is (for the most part) considered easier than CHEM 142 or PHYS 121 (oh god physics at uw).

I believe 10 Credits of NS should be optional and used for CS elective credits like how Math 207 is. If natural science classes are required for grad school, then 10 credits of NS should still be optional because not every cs major wants to go to grad school. Or have classes like BIOL 106 or the non-calculus phys courses be able to fill the 10 credits of NS. The reason why I believe this is because soo much time is used in these Natural Science weedout classes that can be used for internships, clubs, etc that can help a DA advance their career.

As a student who had to get 10 credits of NS at UW, it was dreadful."

My grandfather back in India got diagnosed with stage-2 cancer. And my father flew out to India this Saturday. And my mom will fly out next month. 

  
The cost of treating cancer will obviously drill a hole into our savings. And I'm afraid my parents ' already not-so-stable job will cause my whole family to move back to India. This means my family won't have money to further my education @ UW.   


So I'm reaching out in hope that someone who has earned a merit-based scholarship through the [interdisciplinary honors](https://honors.uw.edu/scholarships/freshman-scholarships/) track can help me look for opportunities that can help make my application more commendable. I'll be applying for honors this coming spring. And all the other scholarships that open up.   


For context, I'm a first-year CSE direct admit with a green card and SSN. I've worked myself to the bones to get here. And I can do it again for scholarships. I can share my CV with anyone if they have any opportunities for me. I'm mentally fine. Just need help to start working towards ways to make money.   


Please share this with anyone you know who has earned any type of scholarship or grants at the UW. It'll help me significantly. Also, my family has enough money for 1 year at the UW but after that, who knows..."

But, I cannot emphasize how HORRIBLE it is trying to find a place to sit and eat on campus. I have an hour in between my lectures (the first one being 2 hours long and the next one being 3 - I'm a grad student aka longer classes) and I pack my lunch to avoid the stress of trying to find a food on campus during that time, but now, I can't even find a place to sit and eat. It's so fucking crowded goddamn EVERYWHERE during this time, I literally have spent 45 minutes everyday wandering through various building, libraries, fucking EVERYWHERE trying to find a SINGULAR SPOT to sit and eat that I don't have to share with someone else and it's literally impossible. I found a single space in the end of a bench in the HUB one of the days but I was so close to so many other people, it felt even more stressful when I finally found this tiny space bc of covid🥲

And because of the cold and the rain recently, eating outside isn't an option and eating inside my classes is no longer an option bc of covid 🙃

As an individual who has struggled with an eating disorder for the past 2 years, this is causing me IMMENSE stress. I already have such a hard time eating but now I can't even find a place to spend literally 30 minutes to sit and eat 🥲 and I can't eat inside my classes because of covid which already is hard for me as I am forced to not be able to eat during my long lectures and now with my one hour in between I STILL can't eat 🥲🥲🥲 

I don't know if you guys can relate but it's been so hard for me, why is it so fucking hard to eat and why is everywhere so goddamn crowded at lunch time. I know it's not UWs fault but it's killing me man, i don't know what to do"

We are a lab in the Department of Speech and Hearing Sciences here at UW and we're looking for adults to participate in some research studies.

In general, our lab recruits adults who stutter and adults who do NOT stutter for a variety of experiments in which **you'll be compensated $15/hr**. We can **reimburse for street parking** and we will provide you with a **free hearing screening** as part of the experiment. 

Most of our studies require simply sitting in front of a microphone and reading words or sentences off a screen. Some studies involve measuring your brain function while you wear a cap (that's just like a swim cap). We have various safety protocols in place to minimize the spread of COVID-19.

We wanted to bake up some halloween-y goods for people and charge like $1 just because we love baking and want to do something fun. I’ve been reading into it and I know we either need to be a RSO or get a temporary food service card to be able to sell goods, but we’re students selling to students, not students selling to the public. In addition we’d only be selling in the residential halls where we live and not outdoors, or on any other part of UW campus. So my question is: has anyone done this before and gotten away with it and do we really need to get a food service card/ be an RSO? Or since we’re students selling to students we’re all good?

His eyes are a bit sunken, and he seems to be around 70.

He needed assistance in getting to his stop in the International District. Specifically, he needed to go to the #7 Bus heading southbound by 4th Avenue S and Jackson St. (will delete this in case it's too private). Specifically, he needed guidance on going to the elevator and walking to the bus. (and make sure to mind your surroundings! I lead him badly and he walked into the wall). I'm not sure if he goes to the same route every time, but he has laminated yellow papers and braille number signs so please mind them! He seems to be prepared to let people know how to guide him, but people need to be willing to guide him.

qkwas4,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/qkwas4/psa_you_should_know_what_violates_ferpa_rules/,PSA: You should know what violates FERPA rules,12,64,2021-11-01 21:25:14,"I recently took a midterm where they required us to write our name and student ID number on every page. ""Ok, if something gets separated, this makes sense as there will be no question about whose paper it is,"" I was thinking as I was starting my midterm.   
When we get them back a few days later, our exams were ripped into multiple sections and **left out in piles for the entire class to go through.** The next section walked in after our class and started going through the piles, too. **Our names in conjunction with our grades and student ID numbers (both of which are by definition educational records and therefore protected) were out and available for anyone to see.**   


You guys, ***this is a blatant violation of FERPA****.* Our grades are personal educational records. If I choose to flip through an exam with all my grades on it in view of everyone, that's my choice. If I want to keep my grades hidden and only look at them in a locked, windowless closet, that's my choice too. Having grades in a pile with identifiable information attached to them *takes away this right that we have as students*.   


[Here](http://courses.washington.edu/registr/FERPA_Faculty_Staff/FERPA_Handout.pdf) is a PDF that outlines some of this. It was written in 2011 but have FERPA requirements loosened since then? No. They haven't. 

[This link](https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/ferpa/) says that ""**Public posting** of grades either by the student’s name, student number, or social security number without the student’s written permission is a violation of FERPA.""

WSU has a statement in [this link](http://ferpa.em.wsu.edu/faqs/) that directly states that handing back graded work like this is a violation. (Under Staff and 'How should I return graded work?' there is a statement that says, ""Distributing graded work in a way that exposes the student’s identity or leaving personally identifiable graded papers unattended is no different from posting grade publicly."")

  
**IF SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAS HAPPENED IN ONE OF YOUR CLASSES:**   
Please follow [this link](https://privacy.uw.edu/report/), and report it! We have rights as students, and being able to call out our university for violating FERPA is one of them. We also have a right to report UW *directly to the Department of Education.* [This](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=478-140-080) shows that right, as well as [this one](https://registrar.washington.edu/students/ferpa/). 

[This page](https://registrar.washington.edu/students/ferpa/) (same link as the immediate last one) has a FERPA training for students (it's a 10 minute video and a short quiz) if you want more information."

I also don't know what I want to major in yet, but the capacity constrained majors and weed out classes are definitely getting me down. If I knew what I wanted I could work towards it but I'm not at the point I know what I want to do.

I also have a health condition and my bronco spasm flares in cold weather which I found out after being here.I can't even go outside for a walk to feel better during these times. 

I have the option to go home and do community and transfer to a UC after two years. But even with that there are cons and FOMO I could get.

I feel like I messed up...,1,3,2021-11-28 19:30:26,"I'm about to graduate next term, B.S. in mathematics and a minor in philosophy. I go to Portland State, and am planning on applying here for the PhD program in mathematics. I'm 100% sure I will get in, since my GPA is 3.8 and I've gotten along really well with 2 of my professors, both of which are willing to send letters of recommendation before the deadline, which is February 15th. 

I'm also applying for Oregon state, the deadline is Jan 15th so I have time. 

Just to look at my other options I started to consider UW and other schools, just because I want to be in another state. I looked at the deadline for the application and it's due by December 10th, and it requires 3 letters of recommendation.

This is only less than 2 weeks away, and Im not sure who I could ask for my 3rd letter of recommendation, but I do have an idea. Either way, I don't think I have enough time.

If I could get my letters in by the end of this week ~ Dec 4th, would they get in time??

I'm extremely nervous because this is a big step for me and I want as many options as I could get. The 2 professors who told they'd write my letter, I asked them September and just completely phased out and haven't spoken to them since.

My mental health has been declining, and just because of how I was raised, I often feel like I'm not good enough and that I shouldn't bother applying. Then I go ""I'll apply when I feel like it, maybe tomorrow, maybe next week, I'm not in a rush, plus I need to think about it"". This has been going on since September and honestly I regret doing this because now I'm applying last minute for some of choices. 

Are letters of recommendation sent electronically? Because if so, that would speed up the process. if it's by mail, how long should I expect for the letters to get there? if there a bit late, say 10 days, does that just void my entire application?"

I have made a couple posts on here about some advising issues, and ultimately this has resulted in me dropping my 2nd major and converting it into a minor. 

In essence, I will be graduating with my degree this June with a Major in Political Science, and three minors/concentrations.

I am wondering if there is anyone here that can help me understand how this would impact Grad School admissions. I already know that this has basically no impact on career opportunities (as I am completing internships right now). 

I am just wondering if there are any graduating seniors, grad students, or anyone who can provide how Graduate school admissions will view this.
