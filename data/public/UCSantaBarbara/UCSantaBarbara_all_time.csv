Iranian here. Recently went to Tehran to visit family for a week. Tried to go back yesterday but got sent back in germany. I'm a dual citizen but I guess the ban includes all iranian nationals.

What can I do? All my shit is in my student apartment and there is nobody there to grab it. I really am worried.

Works been rough and I left to grab lunch and started thinking about UCSB. There were tons of memories that came to my head but one moment stuck out to me the most. 

It was a sunny spring afternoon. I finished my last class and was riding towards pardall tunnel. I see a guy coming towards me, no shirt, no shoes, and a guitar in his hands, yes both of them, while he is pedaling his bike. He is playing his guitar and singing. He passes and I hear *CRASH TWANG THUD*. I turn back and see the guy on the ground. A young Asian man wearing a helmet crashed into him at the roundabout. It was amazing. Everything that my UCSB experience right there in one picture.  I laughed all the way to my house on abrego. People at freebirds watched and I howled. I ran into my house and told my room mates. We spent the rest of the day playing snappa and laughing. 

Cherish every moment you guys have. You will be able to look back at them one day and smile. "

UCR charges a reasonable $7.75, probably close to actual costs. UCSB charges $19, clearing a nice profit for the Registrar's office. To add insult, UCSB charges this fee twice if you first have to clear any financial block, such as a few dollars owed to UCEN or any other department. 

The 8 campuses charging no diploma fee convey the message that after 4 or more years of hard work and tens of thousands of dollars you have earned this small gift from the university. UCSB sends the message that they can hold this document hostage in order to generate more funds for one or more of their pet projects. Yes, it's only $19 (or $38), but the cost in good will is priceless."

I always get nervous going back to school after break, but I'm trying to channel some of that anxious emotion into excitement.

One thing I'm looking forward to this quarter is going to my first concert later this month. Other New Year's resolutions for 2017 I *hope* to keep:

* Wake up early enough for breakfast each day. 
* Figure out a good balance between having effective study sessions vs. designating self-deserved down time, as opposed to just goofing off whenever I'm doing work and wasting twice the amount of time.
* Continue meeting new people, while still trying to keep in touch with the ones I already know.
* GET SOME VITAMIN D!!!! Winter gloom always gets me down and makes me even more inclined to just stay holed up at home. Don't do dat 

I know this subreddit doesn't tend to have any r/CasualConversations type of threads, but feel free to tack on any goals you have of your own. I just think it's cute to look back in the future on the posts you've made in the past.

If not, I still wish the best of luck to all of you :') Study hard. Eat good food. Hang out with loved ones. Get some exercise. 

To all of the first years of transfers (or anyone else, for that matter) who may have had troubles finding a friend group or place to ""fit in"" during fall quarter: keep trying! Don't give up. I'm an extremely shy person myself, but you've got to realize, that UCSB is a collection of some of the friendliest people you'll ever meet, all clumped up in one campus. Take advantage of the fact now :') Feel free to PM me if you need anything.

Good luck. Happy new year, everyone, and I wish you a prosperous Winter Quarter of 2017!! "

I haven't seen her since fall quarter and I'm wondering what happened to her. It's really cold at night and my hope is that she was taken somewhere where she can get some help. Although it feels fucked up to admit, I was pretty fascinated by her and her presence in IV. Anyone seen her lately or know what happened to her? "

My group of eight people lost what was to become our unit for the upcoming school year due to cliff erosion, so we had to find a house for eight still available in May. From that search I learned a lot about housing companies in IV.

Here are some companies you might not know about in case the bigger rental companies (Sierra, Meridian, Wolfe, etc.) don't cut it. I'll give my $0.02 on the bigger companies as well.

Sequoia Property Management: they only manage two places in IV: 6732 DP and 6681 Sueno. Both properties are duplexes. They only allow 2 tenants on the lease for the DP house but charge $5400 for rent; they sort of have a ""don't ask; don't tell"" policy for more people. We had eight total living in the house with no issues. From personal experience I have nothing but good things to say about this company. The property is exceptionally nice for one in IV and the landlord is friendly and fair. We lost a total of $500 from our $10,800 security deposit, and they refer us to other managers. 

DMH properties: they own 6565 Sabado Tarde, 6894 Pasado, and a few others.

Winders Rentals: A couple that lives on the end of DP manages these properties. Among them are 6572 Sabado Tarde, 6698 Sabado Tarde (the house that says Casa Del Sur), 6830 Fortuna, a few houses in Goleta, and others. Their rent is cheap and they're said to be friendly.

Jeff Allen Properties: Couple apartments on El Nido and 6500 Sabado, and three houses on 68 block of Fortuna and Pasado.

B&amp;B Rentals: 6748 DP, 6839 Sabado Tarde, and a few other places scattered about IV. They don't have a website but you can pick up a flyer outside of 6748 DP. 

Gilson Properties: 49, 51, Tiki, 6706 DP, 6707 Sabado, 6647 Abrego. Posts his ads on craigslist. Seems to have a rather shady reputation. 

Isla Vista Living: 6500 DP and two other duplexes. UCSB graduate managed. Properties look nice.

Shoreline Properties: 6521 Sabado Tarde, 1001 and 1015 El Embarcadero, 6682 Trigo, etc. Tons of photos on their site. High rent for some places but properties look nicer than a lot in IV. 

SFM Vista Del Mar: 6566 DP, 6712 DP, bunch of random apartments. Very cheap rent. Some places look a little older than average. Leasing office is next to Sweet Jane. Heard mixed reviews.

Santa Barbara Apartment Rentals: 6570 DP, 6708 Sueno, 6502 Sabado Tarde, etc. Tons of space for the number of people. DP properties have 2.5 bathrooms for four people. Nicely kept properties. Reasonable rent.

Island View Properties: 6606 Sabado Tarde, bunch of duplexes around IV. Places look very nice for IV but rent is insane. Expect to pay at least $825 plus utilities to share a room.

Beach Town Rentals: A few duplexes and houses including the Jack Johnson house. Not the cheapest rent. Lots of photos on their site. Nice places with lots of character.

Now my thoughts on the bigger companies:

Del Playa Rentals: This is Gelb's company. Don't rent from this asshole.

Sierra: My current landlord. No real issues with them so far, but we did have to dispute some maintenance charges. Honestly not sure why one of the rooms in our house is a double and not a triple or even a quad but not complaining there. We'll see how much of our deposit is returned. 

Wolfe: Their places are all either old or overpriced. Heard they're shady.

Meridian: Heard they're even worse than Gelb. A friend got charged $800 because shutting the front door rattled the entire house and broke a window upstairs.

St. George: properties are very nice but rent is high and deposits are apparently not returned. 

Kamap: Nice places, tons of space for the number of people. You'll never share a bathroom with more than one other person. High rent, but relatively cheap deposit which they give back.

Koto: Heard the best things about this landlord. 2 bed 2 bath duplexes seem expensive. 

Hope this info is helpful for those unfamiliar with IV housing."

Unfortunately, I was in a hurry so I couldn't go back and let a T.A. know or take a picture. The professor didn't come to the midterm. I don't want to sound like a dick, but it makes me angry to know that there are people like me who work our asses off every day/night in the library to achieve decent grades while others decide to cheat. Question is, is there anything I can do about this? I was planning on talking to my professor, but I have no evidence besides what I saw.

I don't even know how I feel about this. I know I fucked up by drinking too much and passing out in weird places. Weird lack of emotion going on.

I was accepted to the college of engineering (CS) for the Fall 2016 semester. Being from out of state, my parents were much more eager to see me applying to schools around here to save money on tuition. UCSB was my first choice. I got into a couple other UC's and got the letters from them and emails that I was accepted but never an acceptance email from Santa Barbara, so I just assumed I was denied. I found my acceptance envelope by accident the other day, and when I confronted my parents about it they were very hesitant to say anything. Found out today that my mom hid my acceptance letter because she ""thought it was best"". 



I emailed admissions and they said I'd have to re-apply next fall or go to CC for a couple years and transfer. In my email I was very brief, and just said I was unable to enroll due to extenuating circumstances. I was looking on the website though and it said they extend applications past January if there's a special circumstance.



My question is: what can I do in this situation? If I am able to attain a notarized document or something that proves that my mother hid my acceptance envelope, do you think admissions would let me enroll for the upcoming 2017 semester? Any help would be greatly appreciated. "

Earlier tonight I was crying a little hard on the curb outside my house somewhere on 65 block. I was on the phone but with my earphones in, so it probably looked like I was just crying really hard to myself.

Honestly was just sitting there because I didn't want housemates to see if I went home, and my street is normally pretty empty with not much traffic.

Nevertheless, multiple different people passing by came up to me to ask if I was alright. I somewhat knew most of the people who did, so I've already thanked them. But there was this one pair, a guy and girl, and the girl walked over to ask if I was okay.

I'm sorry I wasn't able to thank you properly for asking or get your name or anything, since I was in the middle of a phone call! But I'm very thankful that you would take the time to check up on a crying stranger to see if they're alright. The people here are very kind.

There'd probably be a higher chance of whoever those people were to see this if I posted it on Free &amp; For Sale or something, but also I don't want to publicly announce that I was crying alone on my curb LOL. So I'll just post it here.

63x6xq,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/63x6xq/cs_at_ucsb/,CS at UCSB,20,55,2017-04-06 18:00:26,"Since the new students thread is 15 days old, I thought I'd post here.  

So I thought lowly of UCSB because of its party reputation, but my entire perspective changed when I visited on a tour and attended an engineering session. The lady who spoke was I think the head of the honors program, and she seemed so passionate about the program here. Topped with the relaxed beach vibes, learning that the engineering school at SB is a top-10 for public schools actually makes UCSB one of my top choices. Compared to what I've heard about Berkeley and UCSD (my top choices before visiting SB) being the land of crippling depression, this place almost seems too good (everyone is undeclared until they meet a gpa req for Berk letters &amp; sciences school and I got in as my alternate major for EE for SD, but got in for my intended major for SB). Currently, the main downside is financial aid, but I'd like to just put that aside for now.  

But as a generally cautious person, I'd like to get some of the raw opinions about cs on this sub since the info I got from the tour may be biased. Could someone give me more details about the CS program here? Internships, student-faculty accessibility, research opprtunities, anything will be appreciated :) Also, I would especially like it if someone could compare SB's program with the other schools I mentioned. Thanks so much!"

69pj2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/69pj2f/a_response_to_the_bds_wall/,A response to the BDS wall,40,25,2017-05-06 21:26:06,"I've tried my best while at UCSB to stay out of politics, but here I am, on reddit, complaining about political bullshit. So I'm sure every walking through the Arbor has seen the large BDS wall the past week, and the message it's been sending. I've read through the wall and most of the points made in support of the BDS movement have ranged from anywhere from propaganda, to misleading, or outright lying. 
&amp;nbsp;

Since the message of the wall was to spur discourse and discussion I thought it would be imperative to go through, and correct the misleading and incorrect information.  
&amp;nbsp;

###Understanding New Anti-Zionism: [picture](http://i.imgur.com/fQOkKTe.jpg)
The First part of the wall I'd like to address is picture. *Understanding New Anti-Zionism*.  The picture states that:

&gt;*""Anti-Zionism is a rejection of past systems of belief and ideology that have allow* [sic] *for the exclusion and suffering on the basis of their Identity. It is an affirmation of the age old adage that 'Injstice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.' ""*    

This is wrong.  The definition for Zionism is:
&gt; ""a movement for (originally) the re-establishment and (now) the development and protection of a Jewish nation.""  

This means that a Zionism is the political belief that Jews should have the right to self-determine in their own state. In no way shape or form does this belief espouse the right to exlude or induce suffering of any kind. In fact, Israel is home to 2 million non-jews (Arabs, Christian, Baha'i, Druze, etc.) that have full citizenship with many holding positions in the Knesset, (Israeli Parliament) Military, and Supreme Court, so I don't agree with the claim that Zionism allows for ""The exclusion and suffering on the basis of a person's identity"".
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

###Dispelling the ""Myths"": [picture](http://i.imgur.com/CPCV778.jpg)
The second picture I'd like to address is  picture *""Dispelling Myths: Face the Facts""*, and since this poster in particular contains so many ""alternative facts"" I'll just get right into it. 
&amp;nbsp;


* ""Allowing people to formally participate in democracy... is meaningless if... you discriminate against them""

This quote is vague because it could either be referring to minority citizens in Israel, or citizens of Palestine in the West Bank. If it's the first case, see above. 

 If It's the second case, BDS claims that since Palestinians cannot vote in Israel then Israel isn't a democracy. Palestinians aren't allowed to vote in Israeli elections in the same way that Palestinian's can't vote in Venezuelan elections and Israeli's can't vote in Palestinian elections. The point just doesn't make sense.
 
&amp;nbsp;

* Israel employs violence to achieve goals such as subjugation of Palestinians. (Poverty, refugees, etc). Much of it is not physical violence.

This point claims Israel uses violence through economic means, but neglects to mention that Palestinian President Mahamoud Abbas [embezzled](http://israelbehindthenews.com/investigation-humanitarian-aid-palestinian-authority-embezzled-personal-gain/15544/) 1 **billion** through Foreign Aid funds meant for Palestinian Workers. Israel also allows 100,000 Palestinian workers to work in Israel with Work permits, so if israel is trying to economically strangle the Palestinian people, it's doing a pretty shit job. 

&amp;nbsp;

* Eyewitness accounts and images of mutilated women and children show that Israel struck the civilian population

This point ""neglects"" to mention that Hamas, the elected government in Gaza and internationally recognized terrorist organization, hid [weapon caches](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/S--tGa1NGP52OdLKYEc-iVECjB9fco9-svIZ48U-Irz-yf2cqIAEn-fs5--bGOGB5cP8NiBx5KhYlbRPiMqhofdAozp_CMEhFFnHUSVkE0W_Uh5L7ah7JlgqaOZimTa1eg)  among the civiliation population and used [human shields](https://josiahe.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/child-shield.png), which is of course against International Law. In response to Israel's ""roof knocking"" tactics, where Israel notifies residents who live where weapons are cached that their house is about to be bombed, Hamas forces civilians into the buildings to delay or call off the strike.  

&amp;nbsp;

* Israel started the war on Nov, 4th 2014

Again, if you're going to blatantly leave out context like this, you might as well be lying. Not only did Hamas kidnap and murder 3 Israeli teenagers, but immediately started firing rockets onto nearby civilian towns, eliciting an Israeli military response [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Israel%E2%80%93Gaza_conflict) 
 
&amp;nbsp;

* Prior to the occupation of Palestine in 1948, they (Muslims and Jews) lived in peace.

This point is my favorite, because it is an outright lie. Jews were massacred in [The 1929 Hebron Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Hebron_massacre) and the Grand Mufti of Palestine, in 1943 claimed [""It is the duty of Muhammadans in general and Arabs in particular to … drive all Jews from Arab and Muhammadan countries""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amin_al-Husseini#The_Holocaust), and worked in collaboration with Hitler against ""the Jewish Question"". So despite how BDS paints a peachy and lovely picture in a word without a jewish state, it's clear it wasn't. 

&amp;nbsp;


###Gaza Water Crisis: [picture](http://i.imgur.com/kABxOZ9.jpg)
As illustrated in the picture, BDS shows how horrid water conditions are in Gaza. But, they neglect to mention that the Gaza strip is 100% Autonomous, and despite receiving water from Israel, uses [Water pipes to build rockets](http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/NEWS/Nearly-all-Gaza-rockets-self-made--Israeli-army_17320122). BDS then blames this on Israel to ""create a dialogue"".

&amp;nbsp;

###Violence against women in Palestine: [picture](http://i.imgur.com/eI3dEzD.jpg)
This picture was just shoe-horned into the wall to make Israel look bad. Israel has nothing to do with how women are treated in Palestine, and the poor minority treatment in Palestine is **extremely** illegal in Israel. It's like claiming you're protesting the Netherlands because women in Chile are beat, it is 100% out of context and doesn't make sense as a criticism for the State of Israel. The only reason this would be on the wall is to demonize Israel and to paint a one sided and false narrative to those who sincerely don't know about the conflict.
 
&amp;nbsp;


###End the Military Aid!: [picture](http://i.imgur.com/yLXcvqp.jpg)
I don't know where they got the $38 Billion dollars, but in 2014, Israel received $3.1 Billion dollars, [(source)](http://mondoweiss.net/2015/11/spends-billion-foreign/) with Egypt receiving $1.5 billion, and Jordan, Pakistan, and Afghanistan all totaling around $1 billion. If BDS was really about the US cutting aid to countries with human rights issues, then I am confused on why Pakistan is conveniently forgotten. 
The Human Rights Watch has detailed how religious minorities in Pakistan are put to death under the Blaspheme law, and women and the LGBT+ community are persecuted as child marriage is rampant and gays and transgenders are imprisoned. 

If the BDS movement was not inherently about malicious libel against Israel, then perhaps we would see some outcry about human rights in Pakistan.
 
 &amp;nbsp;

###But why, what's the point of this post?
I made this post so others can have a look from the other side. I wanted to illustrate how the BDS wall is at least misleading, and at most, maliciously outright lying. I wanted to actually create a dialogue so others could understand the conflict better in full.

There are huge amounts of resources out there and I implore our fellow gauchos to go out and educate yourself on the conflict. I don't want our campus to be filled with perpetual hate and I want others to understand the conflict is, nuanced, and very complex. This post doesn't address everything and in no way am I trying to say Israel is perfect or doesn't deserve criticism.

What I AM trying to say is the ""criticism"" that BDS is making is harmful to an academic and productive discussion.

&amp;nbsp;

###TL;DR: Don't be duped, do your research. Go gauchos."

I noticed here at UCSB people are a lot less respecting of what should be quiet spaces. For instance, my Organic Chemistry class has a whole group of people in the front who consistently talk throughout the whole lecture. I'm talking laughing, playing hearthstone on their laptops. Sometimes they play 20 questions. And I'm not kidding. Also see shit like this in my C Lit 30 class. I asked the group in Ochem to be quiet. Got a ""dude chill, this isn't highschool"".

This also happens in the library a boatload. Currently sitting infront of someone on the 7th floor who's fucking talking on their phone, albiet very quietly. Its the quiet floor though. I won't even go up there when I'm sick so I dont disturb everyone else. Theres 4 other floors to be in.

There seem to be a lot of people posting about feeling lonely or wanting to make friends (not so much right now, but there were a *ton* a little while ago).  Someone (not me) took it upon them to create and moderate a Discord server specifically for UCSB students to make new friends and talk to one another.  It's existed since last November, and started off with a handful of awkward introverts talking about life.  Now there are over 300 people on the server, though not everyone is very active.  

Benefits of joining include:

* a place to talk about classes (#classes), random stuff (#general), or new music/movies/games (#entertainment).

* a place to meet new friends and organize meetups (there's one this Friday!).

* a friendly albeit sometimes trolly group of mods.  I'm one of them and uhh.  We do our best...

* a #toxic channel for those rants and politically incorrect bits of humor you just have to share somewhere.  

* two wonderful bots aka Linus (music) and Mee6 (ranks and greetings).  

* a place to get some support, sympathy, and possibly advice in #feels.  (We are not mental health professionals at all and will encourage you to seek professional help if it seems like it would benefit you though).

* weird inside jokes.  Why am I ""Mr Ith aka Yellin Hellen"" and a ""Robot""?  Who knows... 

* I met my SO on this Discord server!  Unfortunately he's a total derp and I can't stand him (jk he's great).  

*This server is not a place to degrade or bully others.  If you do this you will be warned, kicked, and/or banned from the server*.  

To join the server you need a free Discord account.  You can get one on their [website](https://discordapp.com/).  And once you've done that, follow this [link](https://discord.gg/kU2e9gB) to join the server! 

The server is simply a tool to help people connect with others who may feel lonely or out of place at UCSB.  You don't even need to feel like that to join and start talking to people though!  

And more about the meetup on Friday:

We're going to Nikka to get ramen around 5 this Friday.  I'm driving (one more spot in my car), and I think two other cars are going as well.  Post in #meetups if you want a spot! 

*EDIT*: server rules are pinned in #general, please read them once you join!

You just finished your last finals as a freshmen during spring quarter. You see 3 friends waiting for you at bus stop. We all hop in the bus and go to the goleta amtrak station. We wait there and talk about what we are going to do for summer. My friend says he is going to go eat KBBQ the first week, my other friend says he is going on a trip, and lastly, the third friend says he is going to hang out with his friends back home. We become so excited to see our parents. The Train finally comes and the door opens. We move up into 2nd floor of the train and sit in the 4 seat section right by the beach side. We all start talking. We become extremely excited, happy, and relieved that finals are over. We become quiet and as the train moves eventually to the scenery of the beach, I close my eyes and listen to relaxing studio ghibili songs. I look at the beautiful scenery and the beach is glimering with kids waving byes to us from outside. One by one, my friends start leaving the train, saying good byes. I'm the 2nd to leave. The train attendant starts taking off the amtrak sticker above my seat and I prepare to leave the train. I go on the first floor and see my hometown. I see my mom and my sister looking at me from outside. I smile brightly and go back home.

Not necessarily to prepare them for a career. While this tends to work out fine for most students in Engineering, students in the borderline majors are left out in the cold. 

This is annecdotal, but I know some brilliant, industry-bound students that are struggling to find relevant employment because the skills taught here do not necessarily align with industry demands. Again, it's fine that they do not teach it here because it is not the purpose of a UC, but I feel that a lot of students do not know that early enough.

Has anyone else seen this misconception in younger students? I am curious what you guys think, either from your own experiences or the experiences of your friends."

&amp;nbsp;


Welcome to the world of freedom from your parents! You will shortly realize self-control and time management is huge and with this college can be such a fun time. But, remember it is also a learning experience where school still needs to come first. I want to share with you some things I learned the hard way so you don’t have to experience the same. 


&amp;nbsp;


First of all, go to class. This is some of the best advice I can give. Generally, what a professor lectures is the material that will be on the exam, not the material in the book. 


&amp;nbsp;


Second, when something is due, do not wait until the night before to start working on it. Start as soon as you can. You find yourself much more relaxed and happy when you’re not rushing to get something done, plus getting homework done in advance is always a good feeling. 


&amp;nbsp;


Third on the list, remember to get some sleep. Now that you don’t have your parents harping at you to go to bed you need to take some responsibility to get a good night of rest, especially before an exam. 


&amp;nbsp;


Fourth, take advantage of the free services on campus. CLAS, Career Services and CAPS are wonderful! USE THEM! 


&amp;nbsp;


Fifth, control your spending. You will really be able to separate out your wants and needs after your parents aren’t paying for everything. This part really struck me. I never realized how much money was spent on things that I can easily live without. 


&amp;nbsp;


Sixth, have fun! Make the most of your freshman year. There are always events going on around the campus, attend them. Some of the friends I have made will be my friends for the rest of my life. 


&amp;nbsp;


Lastly, the only other advice I can give is to use your professors. They are getting paid to educate you. When you have questions do not be afraid to ask

I almost rushed last year, but I decided not to at the very last minute because I thought it would be too stressful on top of everything else.

This past year, I've been in an abusive relationship and I don't want to get too into it, but he completely isolated me. I pretty much don't know anyone except him, and the people I do know are just acquaintances and that we both met together. I really, really want/need to break up with him, but I don't want to be completely alone afterwards. I need a support system. 

I have bad social anxiety, especially after being isolated for so long, to the point that I get anxious to talk to waiters. I really want to rush because I've always wanted to be in a sorority and I REALLY need to make some friends. 

I also want to overcome my social anxiety, and apparently exposure therapy is the most effective treatment. I'm really bad at meeting new people and getting the courage to talk to new people, and I think that rushing and joining a sorority would force me to do this and could be really helpful. But I'm pretty awkward and anxious and I'm worried about how that would affect rushing. I'm worried it could end up making me feel worse about socializing if it went badly. 

I'm just wondering what the rushing process is actually like, and how intense it really is in terms of socializing or being judged based on your social skills. I'm not horrible at socializing and I can usually force myself to have some social skills, but I feel anxious and wound up the whole time and I'm worried that would show through, or that I would get way too stressed out. 

I really have a feeling that rushing would be a great experience for me. I've always wanted to be in a sorority, but I'm not what I would consider the ""type of girl"" to join one. I'm not very active on social media (mostly because of the isolation) and I'm a bit overweight (I'm working on it but don't think I'll get the desired results by the time rush starts). I've heard that they really care about looks and social media, so I don't know what I should do. 

I would really really appreciate any advice and some tips on rushing!"

Well look no more, because I was actually arrested for this shit twice freshman year and both were within a month. I had a drinking problem back then and I didn't really realize the extent of the problem only after the second time I got arrested. I went through the deep end and had such a rough time, mentally, that I went to see a psychiatrist for the first time. I thought my life was over, that I had a misdemeanor conviction on my record and I would never be able to work my dream job. I know how it feels and it feels pretty shitty so that's why I made this guide for fellow gauchos to use. 

First off, when you get called over by the police, go to them. Don't run away or act like you didn't hear or any of that bullshit. Go to them. They're gonna ask you a few questions like where are you headed, where you came from, etc. Answer them truthfully and also be gregarious with the cops. Make joke or some shit, but the main point is to not be an asshole. At this point, they haven't decided on arresting you but are just seeing whether you can get home safely. 

If you do get the handcuffs on you, don't cause any troubles whatsoever. Doesn't matter if they're an asshole, if they decided to arrest you, they've made that decision and literally nothing is gonna stop them short of a call from the police chief. When they start asking you questions like how many drinks you've had, etc, just answer them but embellish. They already have enough evidence to prosecute you (slurred language, smelling like alcohol, stumbling, etc) so not answering the cop is just going to make them angry and not serve any purpose. Unless you want to fight the charge in court, none of this matters. Get on the cop's good side and don't cause any trouble. Also a note, if the cops happen to ask for your address, give them your local address here and not your parent's house. They send a bunch of shit to the address on file so if you don't want your parents to find out, give the cop your local address.

You're gonna be taken to the drunk tank in Santa Barbara County Jail and will be booked. You should also not be an ass during the booking process because it's gonna affect how long you're in the tank for. If you're nice and friendly, you're gonna be in there for the minimum hours, which is 8. If you're an asshole the cops, you'll be in there for like 14-16 hours. They're gonna take the laces from your shoes and just put you in the drunk tank. 

The drunk tank is pretty cool. You do get a bunch of random people in there, but there's a lot of UCSB students in there as well. I met a ton of cool people in the drunk tank and am facebook friends with them to this day. Hopefully you're out after 8 hours and you get to Uber home (provided that your phone isn't dead) or take the bus. 

This is where the real stress happens, but its okay. It's not as bad as it looks. 

First and foremost, call AS Legal Resource Center (LRC) and schedule an intake about a week after you got arrested. They lawyer there will call the DA's office and will see whether the case is dropped or if they recommend that you take one of their alcohol classes. About 50% of cases get dropped and that's only if the DA's office is busy with other cases. The other 50% are recommended this $250 class on alcohol that you gotta take and if you do, your case gets dropped, which is pretty sweet. This only happens if this is the first time you got arrested for this. 

It's important that you go to the LRC first because if you go to court, you're gonna get the exact answer from the judge. Not only did you just create a court record (which makes it easier to find this on your criminal background check), but you've been stressing for a month for nothing. You don't need any expensive lawyers or whatever, just go the free lawyer that UCSB provides. 

If you got arrested on campus, your parents aren't notified. If you get arrested in IV, your parents ARE notified. I was arrested on campus twice so I don't have experience, but you can probably call the Office of Student Life (which handles this part) and ask one of their administrators to not send the letter. Changing your address on Gold also doesn't work because I've talked to them before and they said they can see previous addresses. So I would probably just schedule a meeting with them and see what happens. 

However, getting arrested on campus provides a double edged sword. Not only do you have to deal with the Santa Barbara DA's office, but you also have to deal with Office Of Judicial Affairs. They're gonna send you a long ass email and it's going to sound scary but it's really not. Your resources for Judicial Affairs are the Office of the Student Advocate or the Office of the Ombuds. Both of these resources are for people who are in conflict with the University. Note that this only comes into play if the DA doesn't drop charges. If the DA drops charges, I don't believe it even reaches the University, in my experience. I may be wrong. For a simple drunk in public, you won't need either resource. What they do is that they sit down as your ""advocate"" during the ""hearing"". The hearing is just a meeting with the Judicial officer and he/she basically says to take CASE, the alcohol class. If the DA mandates that you take an alcohol class that not's CASE, you can ask the judicial officer to change the class from CASE to whatever the DA says. Boom, you just killed two birds with one stone. 

So I think I covered most of the process. As far as my story goes, my first arrest went fairly standard. I just took the class and charges got dropped. My second arrest was a lot more hectic. I talked to private defense lawyers and they really made the process sound scary. They included hype vocabulary like trial, jury of peers, probation, etc. It really stressed me out and I had to go the psychiatrist on campus and it actually helped a lot. What ended up happening was that I went down the UCPD and asked that the arresting officer call me. He called me a few days later and I kind of asked him why he arrested me, etc (I was walking home with a sober friend). He told me why but he said that I was respectful about it and clearly remorseful and he wrote ""no charges recommended"" at the end of the police report. So I called the DA's office a week later and the DA dropped the charges. Truly a rollercoaster of an experience. 

But yeah, its been 2 years and nothing has showed up on my background report. The good thing about Isla Vista is that if you are arrested and charges are dropped, it technically doesn't count as an arrest but a ""detention"". There was a case here in Santa Barbara where someone got arrested for a DUI but didn't get charged and he argued that it shouldn't be considered an arrest.

1. Employees don't get the tips at all. They get a $10/hour wage which obviously gets taxed.
2. The working environment is absolute garbage. No mats and most of the food stays out and isn't refrigerated.
3. Training is $5/hour and you have to work three shifts. Each shift varies from 3-5 hours so you'll get paid barely $50 by the end of your three shifts.
4. There is a ""test"" to get the job. It is making one food item and four drinks. As a trainee, you won't know half the menu and you'll need to look at a cheat sheet for drinks. They'll expect you to make each drink at an average time of three minutes. In total, 12 minutes.
5. The manager is never there. Pretty bad in itself.

The rest of the employees are just doing their job so I don't have any complaints of them. They're definitely getting the shorter end of the stick with things.

TLDR: Wakecup is some sweatshop labor. Please don't get the food items."

This was due to the fire that is down near ventura. Luckily for us we were not in imminent danger and none of us had to evacuate. However lots of people in ventura had to leave their homes and all their belongings trying to evacuate with no power in the darkness.

Everyone should have an emergency evacuation plan as well as an emergency Togo bag. This bag should include all important documents such as birth certificates, social security cards, diplomas, pictures. A change of clothes. A towel. Water, a basic med kit. Canned food/mres enough for 3 days. Basic Toiletries. For women tampons/pads. Basic medication if you have a prescription. Aspirin, tums ect. If you have a baby, baby powder/formula, diapers. Matches/lighters. Iodine. 

If you have a family you need all of these things for x amount of people.

Even in the case where we don't have to evacuate. In the case of a long term power outage(multiple days) food will be spoiled. This is also why it is a good idea to have multiple days of food in your go bad. Canned food and dry mres are the way to go. 

If you own a firearm take them as well as your ammo. In the case of mass evacuations there will be tons of robberies.

If you have pets you need to bring food for them as well. In the case of an immediate evacuation. Ie the fire is in your backyard or your house is already on fire do not spend time looking for your pets. I understand that pets are family. But do not risk your life looking for a hidden cat/pet. I've spent over half an hour looking for my cat on a Saturday afternoon Chillin in my pj's. It will be much harder under pressure and with an imminent threat of danger to your life.

Do not bother grabbing valuables. Your life is the most valuable object. If it really is that important to you. (a great grandmother's ring, an heirloom) then it should already be placed in your togobag.

Also a fire extinguisher is a must in every apartment/home. A simple grease fire can burn the entire house down if you don't have an extinguisher.

SB Sheriff released it was not life-threatning: https://www.sbsheriff.org/stabbing-suspect-arrested-isla-vista/ .

Her injuries were in-fact life-threatening according to all medical staff. A major vein (external iliac) was severed where her leg meets her pelvis along with significant tissue damage in a slice upwards. By the time she arrived at the hospital she had lost half of her blood and had been fading quickly. If it wasn't for the ONE trained officer, EIGHT blood transfusions, and talented staff at the hospital she would no longer be with us.

I would also like to add that when the incident occurred there were multiple officers on both sides of Camino Del Sur at the intersection of Del Playa. I chased the attacker away right passed them yelling and they absolutely did nothing. If I didn't stop and force their attention away from crashing parties RIGHT THERE to address the victim it may have been too late. Additionally, only one police officer on the scene was trained in trauma injuries. This is disturbing given their perceived preparedness in situations like this only a couple years after the shooting."

When Bus 11 comes shows up, I present the bus driver my card. He swiftly snatches my card and tells me I can't use this because my bus sticker is too 'faded'. I tell him that it's clearly visible that it's this quarter, well, because it is. He refused to drive until I pay up. I told him to let me on this one time and I'll get it sorted out tomorrow since the AS Window closes at 5pm. He tells me just pay a dollar now then instead of the normal $1.75. Going through my mind ""fuck this, an argument isn't worth it"", I scrounge out my wallet from my backpack thinking I have a dollar.

After realizing and telling him I only have 20s, he tells me to put it in and that the machine wouldn't give me change. Yeah fuck that I ain't throwing you a 20. I refused to pay and the bus driver proceeds to say ""You pay the school all this money yet you can't pay a dollar"". The problem is not me paying the dollar. 
I said fuck this I'll just bike and he responded ""yeah have fun man"". After I left a kind girl came out and told me to get in because she'd pay for it. I'm so pissed.

After I got on at another stop he lets in another girl. A few stops later he tells her that he needs to see her card again. Like wtf?

Prestige
UCSB is a great school. People, such as myself, chose it over other schools we got accepted to like UCLA, Berkeley, private schools, and other “better” universities. I have been challenged academically to grow. People who say “UCSB is a party school” are usually old people who aren’t up to date. Ucsb was just a party school in the past, but now it’s a great academic institution (we still party)

Location
You live on the beach. Literally. I live on Del Playa, the street right on the ocean. If you decide to move out of the dorms after freshman year, IV is a fantastic place to live with your best friends or randoms. You’ll learn so many new things about yourself from living on your own

Opportunities
UCSB is one of the top research institutions. Don’t get thrown off by that if you’re not in a traditional “research related” major. The other programs here are sick as well, with connections to alumni, internships, and jobs across the state of California and beyond.

Social/Party Life
UCSB is unique because we are in a bubble. Campus and IV are populated by mostly college students. It is such a different yet amazing feeling. We party hard, but you do not need to party. Many people don’t party and equally love this school as much as one who does party. It is actually easier to not feel like you’re missing out here, because there are always parties going on every hour of the weekend. If you have to study for a midterm, no problem. Go to the lib (yes lib, not the library) and grind it out during the day on Saturday, and head  back to IV to rage at night. Work hard, play hard. Also, you don’t need to be in Greek Life to Party. I believe around 10-15% of the school is Greek.

Diversity
UCSB does have a significant white population, but it is more different than schools like UCLA, UCI, etc. People here are black, Mexican, Asian, European, South American, purple, green, from outer space. But for the most part, we are all so incredibly down to earth. Everyone is so willing to help and we are a community. The term “I Gaucho Back” is real here.

Not UCSB Specific Problems (just general college problems)
-Not finding friends/group immediately: this is not just a UCSB thing. It can happen at any college
-being homesick 
-depressed/anxiety-ridden


You will meet people who hate UCSB. You will meet people who dropped out of UCSB because they hated it. Don’t let those people discourage you. For the most part, those people don’t specifically hate UCSB. They hate college in general. They were not meant for living on their own or this. They would have been miserable at any school. 

UCSB has been the best decision I have ever made. 
This will be four years of your life. UCSB is what you make of it. When you look back in thirty years, will you be able to say you’re proud and satisfied you came here? I certainly will. Live in the moment. 

Additional info for reference
I came in as a freshman, but took two quarters off immediately after my fall quarter because I was in such a bad place mentally (not the school’s fault). In the short time I was originally here, I fell in love. I was so determined to come back, and here I am. I am a sophomore Econ/accounting major in the honor’s program, and I have summer programs lined up for me. PLEASE MESSAGE ME IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS

I have seen many posts about many of you getting accepted into the school, as your chosen or not. First of all, congratulations! I am writing this post to try to help those of you that were accepted as an undeclared and wish to transfer into the CS major. I've never actually made a post on reddit before (except once to meme), so I hope you'll bear with my organization or lack there of. 

1. I decided to attend this school because it was a UC, the only UC that accepted me.
 
After all these years, I realized that it doesn't really matter where you get your education from. Sure the branding of the university is nice and all, but the struggling that comes with it could have been avoided if I just chose a cheaper tuition school that offered me the major I wanted. 

2. Switching majors. For those that are not aware, there are 3 ""colleges"" of discipline; Letters and Science, Engineering, and CCS.
I'm not too informed about the details but by default you get thrown into Letters and Science for math, physics, and non stem majors. 

I was admitted into the school as an undeclared because my engineering choice was denied. I thought, no worries I'll just try to switch back in. At first I was discouraged by how hard it appeared to try to get in, so I tried physics to see how I would like it. I didn't like it, so I switched to math. At some point I felt it was too hard for me, but by then I had taken enough CS courses to try to switch in to the major, so I tried. (CS 8 and 16 are part of the math major) 

Requirements) 16 24 40, math 3a 3b 4a 4b
There are 7 required courses, 3 computer science courses and 4 math courses. If you've taken and passed the ap calculus BC exam, you skip two of these math courses. 
In order to switch into the major, you'll need to get a 3.0 or higher across these classes. Check out this link for more information:
https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/education/undergrad/admissions

Looking back at it, I got really lucky. My grades were the following:
CS 16 - A-
CS 24 - A
CS 40 - B
Math 4a - B
Math 4b - A-
You must get at least a solid B on your first try for each class. Ive seen students get denied a change of major into CS, it would have been all over for me and my college career if I didn't make the grades. But here I am now, hopefully about to graduate with a degree in computer science. 

Obstacles:
The big concern here is, you only get one try, and you must get at least Bs or higher. You're also not guaranteed to get into CS 24 or 40 as you must wait until second or third pass to be able to add them. Math majors have access to cs 8 on their first pass, possibly 16 as well. I was waitlisted for 24 but I managed to get in. Completing these requirements takes at least 3 quarters, so 1 year. CS 40 is also offered in the summer. It is definitely a huge gamble to take, but the payoff is equally as great. 

What I've learned:
You have to do your research, thoroughly. 
     Look through the official process of switching majors and see what you're dealing with. 

You need to plan ahead, years ahead.
     This is what caused me to need to take a fifth year, I didn't do my research and plan my classes out. 

If it seems like I abruptly stopped editing and writing this, I have. I'm actually studying for my last final right now. I can edit my post right? For the mean time I can try to answer questions in the comments. Sorry for making the post feel incomplete. "

Recently, I've been noticing that when I feed the turtles, there's this one female turtle (I could tell she's a female because she had short claws) that would refuse my food. She acted really restless and kept trying to crawl out. I had a hunch that she might be pregnant so I took her out and looked for any signs. From the outside, I could see big bulges near her tail between her carapace and plastron!! Those are her eggs! 

Because turtle eggs do not survive if they're laid in water, I picked her up to try out the different plots of soil around the plaza. She would begin digging at a place, but then stop, and then walk off to a different plot of soil. This repeated many times, so I had no choice but to put her back in the pond. The soil around the plaza may be too hard and shallow for her to dig in.

Can someone tell me who should I contact about this? I rarely see the people who clean the pond and I don't know how to contact them...I would be very grateful if someone could tell me how to contact the workers or anyone who can help this turtle! Thank you for reading!! "

I wanted to make sure everyone knows that today, we all have a chance to reduce our student fees. Everyone always complains that tuition is too high but everyone always votes yes on all the little fees on the ballot. People say that each $5 fee is small but it quickly adds up. $5 per quarter equals $15 per year. Vote NO on the unnecessary fees and also NO on more fees from the uCen renovation. We pay the most in student fees out of any UC. This is our year to finally reduce fees!

First of all, I have no idea who you are. Second of all, you have no intention on starting a conversation with me and your only goal is for me to vote for you. And lastly, you wouldn't approach me or anyone else in any other situation. I would LOVE to vote for you if you approached me in a way where you could introduce yourself, maybe ask me how my day was, AND THEN get to your point. I feel like I constantly see the the fabricated aspect of human interaction walking through that area. I don't know if I'm being too anal about this, but the one thing I do hate is when people get into my face telling me to do something, especially when I don't even know them.

As an FYI, I think student government is really important for any college. Period. Student leaders are the embodiment of student thinking, so in that aspect it is truly important to see this process unfold. I just wish the people running actually cared about what they are doing, rather than trying to boost their resumes (is that too harsh?) I know that's a hyper generalized statement, but my point still stands. 

Maybe try going door to door and making conversations with fellow students. I've actually experience that the other day where someone came up to my door, talked to me for about three minutes about each other, AND THEN brought up the fact that he was running and gave me a run down of what policies he wanted to enact. I voted for him.

Again, maybe I'm thinking about this too seriously. Maybe, I'm not. All I know is that it is extremely annoying having people come up to me to say a few words of ""vote for me, 'insert name'"" while I'm trying to go to class.

8dzj0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/8dzj0w/where_to_meet_girls/,Where to meet girls?,45,26,2018-04-21 16:35:58,"I feel like this post title is going to get some downvotes, but - legitimate question: where are good places to meet girls (as a guy) around here?

As a pretty social student, I do a good bit of partying and know/hang out with lots of people. The problem is that nearly all those people are frat guys and/or engineers, and that I don't know any single girls that I'd be interested in dating (nor do I even have any mutual friends with them as far as I can tell).

I don't really cross paths with girls besides my female friends/friends' girlfriends except at parties and the gym.

My daily life consists of:

* engineering classes (completed all non-engineering classes long ago) - not really any girls here
* engineering job - all non-social guys
* studying at necessary computer lab - all non-social guys
* gym - perhaps there's some potential here? not ideal though
* playing sports - all guys
* cooking/eating at home - with friends
* parties - with the same few groups of people which is great but not for meeting potential girls to date

I'm thinking that I might be able to meet girls somehow through the following relatively unexplored interests of mine: yoga, cooking, guitar, book club, running, some kind of econ/finance-related club.

Besides yoga (any recommendations for yoga places?), I'm not sure if any of those opportunities exist around here, and I don't know how promising any of those would be for meeting girls. Other than that, I could always just strike up conversations with girls around campus/IV/gym, but I wish there were a better way.

tl;dr: where are good places (and/or what are good ways) to meet girls out of your social circle/s and outside of class/studying?

on a semi-related note: anyone know of any good clubs/groups/organizations of people who are serious about and have had some success with entrepreneurial/self-development kind of stuff?"

Long story short, he proceeds to start making out with me after I complained about not finding any girls or guys to make out with at the party. He starts taking it to a pretty sexual route, and I stop him bc we're both drunk and I don't want either of us to feel taken advantage of/regretful in the morning. So here's where shit gets weird. First he tries to force the sex shit by saying ""Oh I won't be into this in the morning"" which immediately turns me off lmao. And then the guy tells me he's gonna call his gf and let her know what happened. I had NO idea he had a gf and I was really alarmed by that fact. Needless to say she was really pissed when he called and told her. So i guess my main question is now he's acting like nothing happened, besides giving me the occasional prolonged look and I honestly have no idea how to proceed with the situation. Anyone have any advice? I really want to apologize to his gf but I feel like I'm honestly the last person she'd want to here from right now..."

The towing company that my property manager works in liaison with is usually pretty good at showing up within 20-30 minutes of calling them (I'm on a first name basis with the towing guy at this point), so I usually get to have the sweet revenge of watching these assholes' cars towed off of my spot, although some people do get away with it by moving their car before the tow truck arrives. Still, it's a fucking pain in the ass that I have to deal with this issue so often. In a way, I have the tiniest amount of sympathy for these people who are so desperate for parking that they feel forced to steal a clearly reserved parking spot that has a towing sign posted front and center.

Which I and my other roommates were concerned about but we figured as long as he was eating we didn't really care.  But the issue now is that I just caught him throwing up again this evening after working out heavily and only consuming roughly 800 calories of food.  So we've assumed that he hasn't stopped throwing up, just adding other weight loss techniques on top of it while being more sneaky when he throws up his meals.   We've tried to talk him into going to CAPS and speaking with someone and he says he will but he hasn't.  He said hes afraid of having this on his personal record.  And I think he's just saying ""he will"" so that he can get us off his back.  He is currently not frail but he's definitely lost weight.  Especially within the last two weeks when he started working out.  And he talks so negativity of his body like all the time. So like what do we do?  He lives with us in the University apartments so should we talk to the RA?  Or is this something we should we even get involved?  I'm just concerned for him."

Use these resources to stay safe if Thomas and his friends come at us again.,38,4,2018-07-08 07:59:54,"The Holiday Fire may be dealt with for now, but fire danger is ever looming in California.
As a lifelong resident of California and evacuee of 2 large fires, my family and I have always listened in on radio scanners to keep up to date. They're free and pretty easy to use; I recommend y'all do the same.
For my phone, I use Scanner Radio by GordonEdwards.net LLC. I've always been an Android guy, but it's free on both Google Play and the Apple Store
Google Play Store link: [Scanner Radio](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.scannerradio&amp;hl=en_US)
Apple Store link: [Scanner Radio](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scanner-radio-deluxe/id498405045?mt=8)
If you prefer to use your computer, or wish to use both phone and computer at the same time, [Broadcastify](https://www.broadcastify.com) is a great place to listen in. It's also free, and you don't have to sign up to use the scanners.
During the Holiday Fire, the stations that I listened to, and the ones with the most listeners on it, were:

    Santa Barbara County Fire
    Santa Barbara County Sheriff, Fire, Aircraft and Marine, Lompoc Police / Fire
    Northern California Major Incident

I'm not a shill, so honestly use any scanner you want or can find. I just think it's a good idea to stay as informed as possible in these types of situations.
Stay safe!"

Fuck this insecure nerd on a power trip who had the fucking audacity to give a lecture on bike safety to the only person on campus wearing a helmet who missed your dumbass trap because I was scanning up and down the road for cars before crossing. There’s no fucking way this gelatinous blob of distilled mediocrity has ridden a bike since childhood.

These assholes are so goddamn lazy they can’t be bothered to use an actual parking space like us plebs and need to stick their giant ass 10 mpg cars destroying our fucking planet on the path, blocking foot traffic and access to the shed for maintenance workers, the real heroes of this university who just had to strike to get their first raise in half a decade.

This pig made fucking $119,088 last year (and still definitely isn’t get laid) to harass students trying to get to work (when not breaking up parties or covering up rapes). Also fuck the FORTY SEVEN (47) other police officers who make just as much plus probably half that again in cushy ass benefits before they retire at like 50 on full fucking pensions. That’s four times what I make as a graduate student (with a fucking engineering college degree) and more than many professors who work literally twice as much. If we gave half the money the UCPD gets to any academic department they’d be #1 in the world in 5 years.

I’m fucking passionate about bike safety; I always wear a helmet, have bright lights and reflectors, etc, and I'm well aware of the dangers of the biking (hint: it's cars). This punitive selective enforcement accomplishes absolutely nothing safety-wise and only discourages people from biking to work. If the university gave a shit about bike safety they would give bicyclists the fucking right of way at that intersection (cars stop 80% of the time anyway) or maybe fix the crumbling sections of the bike paths.

Also fuck the utterly spineless cowards in Sacramento for [https://cal.streetsblog.org/2018/01/08/bill-to-allow-bikes-to-treat-stop-signs-as-yield-signs-spiked](killing AB 1103 which would’ve legalized the Idaho stop) due to pressure from the equally irrational, limpdick insurance industry even though bicyclists to treat stop signs as yields is fucking [https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article147952354.html](scientifically shown to be a good thing). But especially fuck these bastards for choosing to enforce this pointless, dubiously illegal shit.

Also fuck the required $35 bullshit classes and also fuck this pointless bike registration (since when is that mandatory, wtf??? And why do you charge $10 no one is gonna voluntarily pay for this shit when you’re so fucking useless at recovering stolen bikes.) 

P.S. fuck the dweeby ass Hitler youth-looking CSO nerds too"
9b7hj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/9b7hj5/ucsb_map_project/,UCSB Map Project,78,8,2018-08-29 01:40:03,"Hey guys, a few months ago I started working on an improved version of the [UCSB Interactive Map](https://map.ucsb.edu). I had heard many complaints about the map from classmates and I definitely had a few complaints of my own so my team and I created [UCSB Map](https://ucsbmap.com) as a project for our CS 48 class.

&amp;#x200B;

In its current state this project is far from complete (bugs are rampant, styling is incomplete, features are lacking, and documentation is nonexistent) so I'm reaching out here to see if anyone is interested in helping out. If you're interested in web development, GIS, photography, or just design in general, shoot me a message. There's lots of work to be done and it'd be a great opportunity to get some hands on experience in a subject you want to learn more about.

&amp;#x200B;

A sample of the issues I'm hoping to resolve are as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

* I'm currently using Mapbox to host the custom styled map tiles but it can get expensive fast and given the small geographic area needed to be mapped, I think hosting our own tile server would be a more economical solution. There are a few tools out there I think would work but I don't know enough about it yet to make a decision on what would be best. If you're into GIS, I bet you have a better idea and would love to work with you.

&amp;#x200B;

* CS 48 requires projects contain a portion of Java code so we used Spring Boot for the backend however a framework like Spring is way too complex for a simple project like this so I'm hoping to port it over to Express.js (or something else if you have a better idea).

&amp;#x200B;

* Pictures of buildings are either missing or horribly unattractive. I'd like to find someone interested in photography that could take high res pictures of the mapped buildings (you're welcome to use my dslr if you don't have one).

&amp;#x200B;

* The current version is slow! Deadlines were approaching and I agreed to add too many features so I made bad design choices (building and interior data is loaded all at once rather than only when necessary). If you're interested in React/Redux, I'd love to have you help out with finding a reasonable way of figuring out when to load the building interiors.

&amp;#x200B;

There are many other issues I'm aware of as well as ones that I probably haven't noticed yet as well so if you're interested in becoming involved in a project that would help out the community as well as your resume, please send me a message.

&amp;#x200B;

Btw: it doesn't matter if you don't have experience (I didn't know anything about stuff like this a few months ago). There are lots free resources online to learn about this stuff and I'm willing to share my own (but limited) knowledge as well. If you're interested in contributing but scared of making mistakes along the way please don't let that stop you. I'm a noob and this is the first time I've tried to put together an open source project like this so I'm just trying to learn as well."

I called the IVFP after the incident (around 11PM this Friday evening) and requested to speak with their deputy which was promised to respond to my call. Obviously they didn't. So I called in again, asking why such a high police presence was required. They said it was to ""shut down noise"" which was very much -not- an issue on the block. So I asked even if ""noise"" was an issue, why did it require four cruisers/vans and what appeared to be at least ten officers on the case?

The fries are a different thinner type now, frozen like they always were; the ""regular"" portions are smaller, and even so the taste sometimes has hints of a cigarette taste. This was on me, but last night I couldn't resist a box as I streamed Avengers: Infinity Wars online, but this morning my stomach hurt and still hurts like a motherfucker.

Unfortunately, I had to drop housing since I couldn't afford it, this left me with having to commute everyday to school. Initially I didn't think this would have had such an affect but because I have to leave school at 4:40 I couldn't take the required class for the program. I dropped INT 95, the class, during the first week of school. I received no notification or email and I thought that I was alright and still in the program. A week goes by and I got nervous and email FSSP staff. They called me and told me that I have to take that class and if there is no way I can, which there isn't, that they would drop me from the program and just make me a normal student. Since then I have had a lot of trouble socializing with other students like I thought I would be able to through the program. I can't stay for the evening events nor attend the ones for FSSP students and I really only interact with other freshman during class time, many of them eat lunch in the eating halls and I don't want to ask them to have lunch with me because then they would have to pay rather then use their meal plan. I live in Lompoc and most of my friends from high school are already off doing there one thing. I'd like to meet new people who are happy to accommodate my awkward schedule, though I realise that that's asking a little much. I'm a physics major who enjoys videogames of all kinds, playing tennis and sometimes being dramatic. All I need from y'all is a little help meeting people.

1. It's okay to be scared. Going to college is a huge change for most people (new place, new people, new schedule, etc.) and it can be daunting!
2. FOMO (fear of missing out) is real, but don't let it get to you or make you feel bad about your own life. You don't have to go to EVERY event during Week of Welcome; take time to do what you want to do. Also, remember that no one is posting about their failures or bad times and that social media only shows the best moments of people's lives.
3. The party school rep doesn't mean you have to. Never feel like you have to party, smoke, drink, etc. just because it seems like everyone else is doing it. If someone offers, you have every right to say no and no one will ever put you down or make you justify your choices. If they do, maybe they're not the right crowd.
4. It's okay if you don't find your group of friends in the first week, first quarter, or even first year. Know that for every group that forms in the dorms, another one drifts apart after the first year. Heck, I didn't even feel like I found my place until my third year. And that's okay.
5. Call your mom. She'll appreciate it. And though you won't admit it, you need it as much as she does. 
6. Step out of your comfort zone from time to time. I like to say that ""adventure begins where your comfort zone ends,"" and it's true! Go to that cheesy event your RA is hosting or paddle out on a kayak at campus point. Sure learning is the main reason we are all here, but a balanced life will help you succeed far more than studying in your dorm all day. 

Most of all, don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. That help can be from friends at home, your RA, or even on this subreddit. No one gets through college alone and there are tons of resources that UCSB offers to help you make the best of your 4 years here!   


I realize this is kind of a random post, but I know if someone had posted something like this when I was a freshman, it would have helped me out a lot so that's why I'm doing it now. If you have any other perspectives or advice, definitely share it below!"

Some helpful pointers I’ve accumulated over the past 3 years:
-cops will be plentiful, do not make yourself a target by walking in a group of 20 (obviously) freshmen.
- DO NOT sit on the curb, act belligerently while walking down the street, or dare to carry an open vessel like a red solo cup anywhere in an open public space, even in a front yard (I’ve seen people/friends arrested for all of these things).
- if you’re at a party, remember this is still someone’s house. Be respectful you wild animals. STOP SHITTING IN PEOPLES BATHTUBS I HAVE SEEN THIS AND IT IS NOT COOL.
- pls don’t sit on any ledges or cliffs esp if inebriated. DP is great but not structurally sound tbmfh. 
- RESPECT OUR BEAUTIFUL SHARED HOME. No littering pls, stop dumping shit in the ocean and streets thanks. 
- DONT DRUNKENLY DEFACE PEOPLES CARS/PERSONAL PROPERTY ITS SO WACK MAN.
OKAY NOW BIG IMPORTANT ONES LISTEN UP 
- if you see anyone in a clearly inebriated state unattended or alone with someone in what feels like a dangerous situation, please intervene!!! Sexual assault is unfortunately all too common on our campus and we can help prevent it!!!
- on that note, NEVER leave a drunk friend unattended, I don’t care how fine they say they are, be a good person and see ur buddies home!!!! CALL A CSO!! They will walk you home anytime of the night!! They don’t care how drunk you are!! 
- please know the symptoms of alcohol poisoning (shallow breathing, pale skin, vomiting/unconsciousness) and CALL 911!!! You don’t want to lose your life over gettin in trouble!!
- just generally be a good person to yourself and others. We are so lucky to belong to such a special and amazing community. 
I know some of these may seem common sense but trust me, they all bear repeating as I’ve witnessed all these things many times. Most of all HAVE FUN GAUCHOS!! OLÉ OLÉ OLÉÉÉ

I'll have access to showers and laundry, so I'm good in the hygiene department.

I'll be going to the AS food bank often for food.

I know there are fellow Gauchos/Mapaches in a similar situation and I have a few questions for y'all:

1. Good places to sleep in a car overnight? I found the Safe Parking Program in Santa Barbara through google; anyone have experience with that? Also I'd prefer not to break any laws/get ticketed/get woken up by a cop and have to move.

2. I'm not opposed to sleeping outside and I've got a tarp and warm sleeping bag. Any good sleeping spots?

3. Should I get my windows tinted so it's not so obvious? 

4. Any other tips or pieces of wisdom?

They were of course blocking the main West Side entrance. I asked if they could let me through and they said no they don't want to let people into the library and that I should educate myself about what's going on.

I told them that I was fighting for my honor and I told them that if they didn't stop protesting they would give me no option but to challenge all of them to a game of Duel Monsters. At first they were ready to accept the challenge, but then my Millennium Puzzle activated and Yami took over. Fortunately it wasn't season zero, so nothing murder happened, but they immediately knew not to mess with me. I then showed them I possessed the three god cards in my deck. The protest immediately became a riot and then firefighters had to hose them down like in the good ol' days of the Civil Rights Movement, when we were allowed to fight back against those stupid protesters lol. I dabbed on them and then said ""just get a better job libtard"" and dabbed on them on more time. Why the fuck you want decent treatment, Pablo lmfao.

But if it wasn't for my puzzle and my god cards, I would have never made it inside to the library and gone out to the East side to save myself a precious 2 minutes of walking.

He ""demanded"" that we remove all parifinilia(?) and marijuana from the premises (obviously did not do so).

I'm not sure how I got there but I haven't been really felt like I'm living the college life I need to be living.

For starters, I'm wanting to know if there's any way to just remove the meal plan for 2nd years. I'm on the 7 plan per week and don't use virtually any swipes because I really just can't stand the food at the dining commons. Instead, I've been spending a lot of the money I've accumulated over the past summer just on food alone. Point being I think I can convince my parents to give me at least $10 a day for food and remove my meal plan completely if I can manage that which solves that issue.

In addition to this though, I think I have a problem with my nutrition. When I go out and get food, it's never really the *most* nutritious kind of food and I'm a bit concerned about what I might be missing as I tend to get a lot of headaches while I'm at school, but not while I'm at home. I'm just curious if there's any resources on-campus for this type of issue.

Lastly, I've been meaning to start getting more exercise as of late but I'm really lost on where to even begin, how long/often I should be working out, etc. So if there's any resources anyone can point me to on that front that'd be awesome.

Anyway, thanks for reading through all this and thanks in advance to anyone who can help me with any of this."

It all started a little over a month ago, when one of my roommates, I'll call her Wynona, started stroking her beaver at about 11 every night. It was surprisingly loud, but I don't judge, and people have their needs. I thought it would be a one night thing. Until the next night.

Then the next. 

And the next.

&amp;#x200B;

My other roommate, I'll call her Joan, started clearing her throat pretty loudly, but Wynona couldn't seem to take the hint. A Few nights later, Joan began a policy of retaliation, which only angered Wynona and every night things would get louder. Joan started saying her own name, I think to assert dominance. Things smell like piss sometimes, I think as a result of some territorial fight. Wynona started performance enhancing drugs recently and they both have crazy gym routines.

&amp;#x200B;

And now I'm caught in the crossfire.

&amp;#x200B;

Every morning, we all act like nothing's happened. Wynona, Joan and I still talk over coffee before we split off for the day, but at night it's like a goddamn arms race. Do I join in, do I record the sound and play it over a speaker? Do I turn on the lights and tell them to stop while they're both  in the act? I can only really sleep during the day now as the adrenaline from the incident every night stays in my veins and it's affecting my academic performance.

They have no volume control and neither do their friends. However, I’m not too bothered by this because we all share this room and idc what they do in here. I do quite a bit of Facetime-ing with friends but 90% is doing work with no talking. Past issues of them with me include 1) clicking too loudly  when I play CSgo and 2) playing academic videos out loud while I was in my loft bed. 
I have EarPods in 90% of the time and will play videos out loud occasionally bc I wanna give my ears a rest and my roommates play their shit out loud too. 

Today, several of their friends come into our room. One of the friends calls another friend to come over. They screech for 15 minutes with my two roommates while I play my video (required for midterm) full volume unplugged to drown them out. Asshole move of me mayb haha. One of the non roomies tells me to put on headphones. I say I don’t have any. My volume was originally low and I only turned it up when they started screaming non stop in the room. 

Roommates go out and come back making demands: 
- must stay quiet until 10:30am (I have morning classes, they don’t)
- prep clothes, notebooks, supplies, etc the night before as to not disturb them in the morning 
- stop FaceTiming my friends so much because 1) it’s “forcing” one roommate to go to the lounge and 2) it disturbs other roommate’s daily naps 
- Stay quiet because this should be a quiet room 
- Insinuate that I go to the lounge (mentioned that I went to the lounge fall quarter and stopped this quarter tf)

Whenever I pointed out an issue, they would say, “Yeah BUT...” and make excuses and blame me. I believe their main issue with me is that I FaceTime my friends too often which I get, but dam chill I’m in my personal space and am not talking most of the time. They think I’m in the room too much...one of them is taking a VERY light courseload and watches Netflix in bed out loud 24/7 then complains they don’t get enough sleep 

Personally idc what they do. Whether they play their shit out loud or make the windows crack with their voices. After this talk, I am annoyed and think they are hypocritical, have no awareness, and have no chill. They’re kind of doubling up on me and taking advantage of my passiveness. Sorry if I ranted, I’m j irritated rn

So I'm a first-year living in Manzanita. I've always had a pretty close group of friends growing up. However, while I've been here, I feel like I've made a lot of acquaintances but very few close friendships (if any at all). For example, I eat with some people from my classes every so often and I work on homework/study with them pretty often. In any of these cases, I feel like I enjoy their company but I don't just ""hang out"" with them regularly like they do with each other. For context, I also have a girlfriend who I've been with for a while here and she's awesome. 

I've always had the privilege of having a close circle of friends in high school and in other activities I've done but here, for the first time, I feel very alone and friendless. I have been dealing with pretty bad (clinical)depression since my last year of high school and my hypothesis now is that I've become somewhat of a fragment of a person that's just too boring to connect with others. I try to be considerate and to remember things about people and to ask about them but it always seems like they would rather be with their real friends than me. 

I'm pretty sick of it, to be honest. Going through every day is agonizing and I think having friends like I did would make it better. I've noticed that I feel better about myself and everything else when I have a social interaction that I judge to be positive for both the person/people I'm talking to and I. I want to change and I want to be better but I feel broken. 

I'd imagine that my experience is quite common for freshmen so in r/learnmath's fashion, I will explain what I've done and ask for advice from those who are more knowledgeable on the kind of things that might be to come. 

I've sought out medical treatment(medication, therapy) for my condition and I've tried to just be myself around people more. I've also started exercising every day. I plan on joining some relevant clubs(possibly an org like ATO) to me next quarter so I can put myself out there more and also so I can do more things(generally, I don't do a lot right now. My day is mostly spend on Youtube and studying).

A large piece of advice I see on making close friends is that I should organize my own hang outs and invite people even if I don't feel that close to them. However, I've always struggled with that and especially now, I would have a really hard time doing that. However, if it really seems like that's the one thing I need to do to improve everything, then I absolutely will do it. 

For those of you who've gone through something even remotely similar, did it help? Is it worth the effort? I get scared that I already have what I want and I just don't realize it but I feel like something's different... but I suppose that might just be how college is. 

For all of you that respond in any way, thank you so much. I really really appreciate it. "

My case is particularly annoying to deal with - I have a long-term S.O. who will be coming with me, and ideally, so will our dog (I have medical documentation for him so we're not too worried about the place being pet-friendly). The $$ offer for the PhD program is pretty good, but I'm still struggling to find anything remotely affordable for us. We've been together for 7 years so I hope it makes sense that we are looking for somewhere we can just have the bedroom &amp; bathroom to ourselves. If it's not too picky, it'd be extra great if the place was in a quiet area (doesn't have to be in IV, either).

So far, my strategy has been to search ""apartments"" on Google Maps around UCSB and check all the apts that have websites. A lot of them don't list rates online, though, and when I try to contact them I get robo-responses. Hence this post of desperation....

We aren't opposed to living with others in the house/apt if needed. We did find a cool 3bed/2.5bath townhouse for $3000/month total that's just east of campus, but finding roommates for that has been tough as most people want to live in IV. Also, the move-in date is May 20, which is an awkward date to make work for us &amp; most others, I'm sure. (For what it's worth, we're looking to move in July or early August.)

I dunno, I feel like I'm rambling &amp; going in circles - do any other serious couples have a decent living situation there? Am I not looking in the right places? Any and all suggestions would be really appreciated. I'm so sorry if this has been asked before; I tried to sift through the other posts, but I didn't find anything specific to finding decent housing for a couple. Thanks so much!!"

I look forward to going to class everyday and hearing the opinions of my fellow students, they are so much smarter than the students at the previous university and CC I attended and it’s not even close. (The first essay I had to peer review at the out-of-state school I originally attended literally sounded like it was written by a first grader, and definitely did not sound like someone who belonged in college, or even high school for that matter. It was a shocking experience). The discussions we have in some of my smaller classes here at UCSB are incredibly eye opening and rewarding to be a part of. I started going to office hours more often and building relationships with professors, and have enjoyed getting to know them. It’s a lot of fun nerding out with them and discussing our shared interests in depth. It’s such a privilege to be around so many smart, motivated people, and idk if I will ever be lucky enough to be a part of such a friendly, supportive and intellectually curious group of people again. As someone who unabashedly loves learning, UCSB feels like a learner’s paradise. I just went to the library for the first time last week (lol) and it blows the libraries at the other schools I attended out of the water. I wish I wasn’t graduating over summer, as 4 quarters feels too short a time to have spent here, but unfortunately as I’m sure many of you know, finances often dictate life plans. Bottom line is having had the college experience at a couple different places, UCSB is by far my favorite and I love the academic environment here. I feel incredibly fortunate to be able to study at such an amazing institution and wouldn’t trade it for any other college experience."

I transferred in fall 2017. I was choosing between UCI and UCSB but decided on SB first because of the major, then study abroad opportunities and then location. My ma sometimes would drive to SB for work and always told me how lovely it was.
I was happy at my CC and had a good amount of friends and I thought uni would be the same, if not better. But now, nearly 2 years into transferring, I feel like my experiences here were nothing like I imagined. Besides the horrible weather and ugly beaches, I have had nothing but nightmare roommates and to this day have not made a single friend. I would not describe myself as either introvert or extrovert, I am not scared of talking to new people, but at every club I tried to join I have never clicked with anyone. 
I also wasn’t well aware of how hard it was to graduate on time as a transfer so I ended up giving up studying abroad to finish on time and also for money’s sake. The most challenging part has been the return of my OCD symptoms due to a very traumatic experience with a specific roommate. I was diagnosed with OCD at 13 and have been in and out of therapy but this recent relapse was the toughest I have ever had to deal with. My saving grace is that SB has an OCD Center close to where I live.
Overall, I feel disappointed, depressed and alone. After class I just study by myself, I don’t go out with anyone. I really don’t know what I could’ve done differently and it has been a huge blow to my self-confidence. At this point, I feel like I’m leaving the university worse off mentally/emotionally that I started with and I’m questioning if a BA was worth it. I have only 5 weeks left until graduation but I find it harder and harder to maintain focus and motivation.

Was reading this article from Cornell and saw this. 

“Since 2003, Slope Day has always featured one headlining artist and two opening acts. The selection process for these artists begins well before the beginning of the school term in August, when programming board members brainstorm and draw inspiration from summer concerts and festivals, evaluating artists by watching performance videos.

In early November, the programming board sent out their picks of 20 artists to the student body asking for their opinion. The poll is advertised in Denice Cassaro’s email blasts, on all of the Slope Day official social media accounts and sent to all of the executive board member’s friends and acquaintances.

“We spend time and effort making sure that it’s spread around campus and reaches a variety of Cornell students and organizations,” Udwin said.”

Why doesn’t AS Program Board do this and still have it as a surprise as to who exactly it’ll be instead of just secretly deciding amongst themselves and spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on artists most students aren’t excited to see? I’m not hating on Program Board — I appreciate the work they do and they do have good artists sometimes. But damn, reading this just made me realize how little sense our process makes."

bkhxkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/bkhxkk/feeling_unmotivated_and_burnt_out/,Feeling unmotivated and burnt out,45,7,2019-05-03 22:29:40,"This is my last year here and I'll be graduating this quarter. I am currently working on a couple research projects since I want to be a researcher in social science. I've also been looking for jobs related to research, because I know it is something I want to do.

Overall, though, I'm feeling burnt out, and I just don't want to do anything anymore. I feel like my thoughts are racing, and there are times when I feel so overwhelmed and worthless. I feel really stressed but unable to move. Then, after a day of binge watching shows I get upset at myself for not doing stuff. I usually go through these phases, but this has been lasting longer than usual. I can't really pinpoint why I've been feeling this way. I tried journaling but I get tired of writing, CAPS but I don't have time to commit to one/all sessions (and explaining everything can be exhausting), mindfulness (but I get really anxious)

I want to say it's the stress that comes with post-graduation, but I know I'll find something and learn to be happy with it. Or probably my projects, which I feel like I'm failing in. Maybe it's the research culture, and a lot of experiences with overly critical and cocky researchers. Or maybe just having a shaky support system. I'm trying to rationalize this in any way I can, but I end up crying and feeling not confident and incapable. 

Are any of you also feeling this way? And if so, how do you conquer it?"

byeg18,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/byeg18/revised_library_floor_tier_list/,Revised Library Floor Tier List,252,49,2019-06-08 17:19:19,"From my last: https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/a3tm2v/library_floor_tier_list/

**F tier**: Floor 3 
Does this floor even exist? Go to ucen study rooms.

**D tier**: Floor 1

Loud as shit, people walking through left and right and talking loudly. This is pretty much the equivalent of studying in a hotel lobby. Your only hope here is to be a degenerate and take a computer station and put your laptop there to study because you get those sweet office chairs. Unless you can't go up stairs and elevators scare you, go to another floor.

**C tier:** Floor 4 

Pretty much the benchmark from which every other floor is measured, the unit floor, if you will. Everything is either better or worse than this floor, and there's really not much to say about this one. Always crowded, decently loud, lots of people and friends studying together, but also has the sick side room outside the elevator which outlets and tables. Men AND womens bathroom, this floor is a jack of all trades, but master of none. Some people like to go to it time and time again, for a certain familiar comfort. Others, like myself, have moved on from freshman year and only use it now if someone asks.

**C+ Tier:** Floor 5 
Heavily moved down from my previous ranking. Yes, the tables are good, and yes, the outlets are nice, but frankly, a quiet floor and an open table are never really going to work out long term for you. Beyond this it's only marginally better than Floor 4 on its sleeper value. If everyone knew about it, it'd be C-.

**B tier**: Floors 6 and 7 

Floor 8 but worse. 

**A Tier**: Floor 8

This is going to be the number one floor for most people. Let's be real. If you want to focus, work, and be productive in the library, it's this floor you want. Now, I know every excuse in the book.

""The floor is *too* quiet""

""It's *sooo* far up it takes forever to go down to get something from the arbor""

""You can't study with friends""

Yeah, tough luck little shit. Floor 8 is rough, it's far away, its an island in which you're confined to a small box. But guess what, in this floor you are the most productive, in this floor you are the least tempted, you are sensory deprived, only your work in front of you. Every excuse against it? Vague attempts at procastination and YOU not wanting to actually just get shit done. I am not going to mark down Floor 8 because of your personal issues with being productive and studying. IF you want to get A's, get shit done, and feel productive. Go here. If you dont want to, that's fine, don't go here, but don't complain that this floor isn't the best because you can't talk to your friends and go to the arbor on a whim. It's like a body builder coming up with the perfect workout routine to get you shredded in 3 months and you saying ""That's too hard"". Just come here and work. or don't and don't. your call.

**S Tier**: Floor 2.

Floor 2.

No, that's not a joke.

In my previous list, I had this ranked as the second bottom tier. and now, it's S tier. 

It's the chad floor.

""But why? I always go here and every table is full and it's loud and blah blah blah.""

yeah, I didn't say it was the best floor for you, I said it was the Chad floor. If you have friends, and you have commitment, you can snag a study room here nearly 24/7. Oh, you want them NOW? during dead week? Should've been there 2 weeks ago trying to book one. Sucks to suck. 

If you have a study room, this floor is pretty much the best thing ever. A small isolated room with a large table. Outlets everywhere, it's a 2 minute walk to the arbor and back, it's perfect for inbetween classes or just to hang out with people if you don't really want to study, and it's also perfect for those late night adderall binged study sessions.

Close your eyes, I'll walk you through the life of a Floor 2er. 

You just get out of Ochem, your friends are complaining about how hard the final is going to be, and how there's no way that they can study for everything. They're all talking about studying together, that cute girl you like comes up to you and says, ""Hey xxx, We're all going to my place to study, do you want to come?""

You look at her and you say, ""Oh, I have class in 2 hours, I was going to go to my study room.""

Dead silence. Everyone stops talking and looks at you, you can see a twinkle of desire in the eyes of your crush, she stammers,

""oh-, you have a study room? So I guess you're not going to come, haha... That sucks, I have class sorta soon too and-""

You cut her off, you already know she's begging the question

""Yeah, you wanna come with me?"" you look up to your friends, they're all silent, staring, they want in, will you give it to them? you feel generous, ""You guys wanna come too? we could order some pizza, it'll be lit.""

Instantly they look at you with gratitude and appreciation, you can see one of your friends shed a tear. 

Together you all walk your bikes and skateboards to the library, and you go up. There's a few people in the room you have reserved, laptops set up and notebooks open, all deeply in the middle of something.

Your crush says, ""oh, looks like there are people here, I guess we don't have to-""

you cut her off by walking into the room, you stare at the people, with curtness and confidence, you say ""Uh hey, I have this room reserved."" embarrassment and blushes from everyone in the room, they pack up their stuff quietly and skimper out, Your friends come in, awing the room. Some of them have never been in one before.
"" Is that a white board? Oh dude I should've brought a marker! ""

""How long do you have it reserved?""

""Ooh someone go steal one of the comfortable chairs.""

you take your place at the head of the table, your crush sits by your side. you see non-studyroomers walking outside, looking in the room. Yeah, they jelly. You look at your crush and say ""I'm going to go to the arbor, you want anything?"" She quietly asks for a yerb. you walk out, knowing half the pleasure of the room is not being in it all.

Yeah, that's floor 2 for you. You missed out this quarter, and probably this year. But don't worry, you always have a chance after summer :)"

I hope that you will all do well and enjoy your time. As orientation is coming up, I decided to post a couple tips to make your experience better and things I wish I knew as a first gen student. Please bring extra cash to buy your student id (unfortunately it’s not free and it will save you time later). If you want a UCSB hoodie but are low on cash, there’s $20 sales throughout the year and some options in IV as well. 

Additionally, you may or may not make friends at orientation. That’s okay and don’t let it discourage you. You’ll find your place at UCSB at clubs etc... and please for your own sake, don’t go over 12-14 units unless you really need too. Unless you were on a trimester system, the quarter system is a different beast. You can always take classes at cc to lessen your load and have it as a gpa booster for certain programs (ie law school).

I know a lot of new students are really nervous about coming in and picking their classes and just the general transition but I wanted to reassure you that at your orientation, you'll actually get assigned an orientation leader who will help you sign up for classes. In fact, theres actually a limited number of classes even open to freshmen because all the returning students already got theirs in the spring so it's honestly not worth stressing about picking classes yet because you wont even get the list of available classes until you get there. 

That being said, theres still lots of classes available, and the school even reserves spaces for new students in all the intro classes so you'll still be able to get all the classes you need for a full schedule and to graduate on time. I just wanted to make this post saying not to stress too much and look forward to the time you do have here because it's a great school and your time here goes so much faster than you'd expect."

While I was there, I had a REALLY bad quarter where I received straight ""F""s in all my classes.  That same quarter, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, which were the cause of my poor grades.  I obviously didn't care at the time because my brain was fucked, but here I am 10 years later, after working my ass off at community college and graduating from SF State with a 2.36.  I got mostly ""A""s and ""B""s, but that ONE QUARTER AT UCSB brought me down so far that it hardly mattered what my grades were after.

Now I want to apply to graduate school, where it becomes tricky.  Because I don't have a 3.0 due to that one quarter, I cannot get in to any masters program.  Since graduating and applying to programs, I've taken a few classes at a cc by my house where the ""A""s I've received only amount to a 0.03 increase or so in my GPA per class, so I decided to stop wasting my money on that route.  

So, all of that was the background leading to my ultimate question:  Is there anything at all I can do to get rid of the impact that one quarter at UCSB had on my GPA?  

I have read about retroactively withdrawing from a course, but the petition seems to imply current enrollment in the school. It was also so long ago that my professors either no longer work at the school, nor would they even remember me. In addition, I live in the Bay Area so I could not go in to the college of letters and sciences office to talk with a counselor about it.  Any help is appreciated!!

Side note:  If you are reading this and you are either currently enrolled or are just starting at UCSB, let my story be a cautionary tale.  If you are struggling in your life for any reason and you are doing so poorly you might fail, do what you can to withdraw or retroactively withdraw. Don't be concerned about what a ""W"" looks like on a transcript. It is easier to explain away a shitty quarter than have to explain away a failed quarter with a shitty GPA. It was impossible for me to bring up my GPA to the 2.36 I graduated with from a 1.75, even though I averaged at a 3.90 the 4 years after my attendance at UCSB.  UCSB is a great school with tons of resources, but only if you ask for help."

My internal dialogue beats me up and the first step to change is to defeat these negative thoughts by developing more positive, loving ones. I constantly reach out to my mom and friend’s for support, but I don’t want to be THAT person who is always doing so.  

My world feels like it is constantly spiraling down. I am in that hyper vigilant state non stop and can’t function properly, let alone focus on studying for finals. How do you be more positive? How do you ground yourself? I use meditation apps which help, but I can’t exactly meditate when I am in class 

I beat myself up over things in the past I can’t control now because I think my life would be better if I had done other things (which is not true and I would be doing the same thing in those circumstances). How do you move forward from past regret? How do you forgive and love yourself?

I struggle with marijuana use and I used to drink all the time. I don’t want to continue using any substances, but weed does calm me down for the moment and helps me see the big picture with more clarity, but it is something that must goes. What tips do you have for overcoming substances? I go to the gym every morning and that helps tremendously

Overall, how have you grown to love and trust yourself to accomplish what you desire? I am so at war with myself, even though I somehow manage to do well academically and socially, but the price I pay of self hate and doubt is not worth it.

I have a difficult time holding myself accountable for my decisions and look for other external reasons why I am miserable. Nothing is going to hurt me in this current situation, so I know it’s my mind and body tricking me. How do you feel more “grown up?” I do mature things but I discredit every positive thing I do"

Maybe someone already has but idk should I say something? Is there even anything that would be done? Seems like maybe there would be given her department? I’d like some honest advice

It's more in line with UCR ($251 million) and UCSC ($207 million) despite having a much stronger academic reputation. Anyone know the reasoning for this?

This would allow students going into their first year to know exactly what to take and when in order to increase the overall graduation rate while allowing students to maximize what they get out of the university academically. Going into UCSB I found that the scheduling process was overwhelming and I ended up taking classes that either fulfilled a single GE when I could have been taking courses that fulfilled multiple or the effort to map out being a double major was too much.

I graduated 2 years ago. I managed to get my the deactivation postponed by 1 year because I was still involved with research projects on campus. But now I’ve been informed that my UCSB e-mail account will be deactivated and there are no more extensions I can get. 

The title really says it all. Even as UC tuition has reached an all time high, apparently UCSB can’t afford to give its alumni an e-mail address. 

I know that many of us have other online accounts (such as Amazon or Faceook) that are tied to our umail accounts. Looking through thousands of emails to try and find the various accounts you have tied to your umail is a tediously annoying task, to say the list. If you’re new to UCSB - please take this piece of advice: never register any account with your umail address. 

Almost every single private university in the country allows their students to keep their e-mail accounts forever. It’s a good policy - it fosters alumni loyalty. It’s also beneficial for applying to jobs - employers prefer seeing .edu e-mail addresses. 

It seems that UCSB would rather pinch pennies than foster long-lasting alumni relationships. Such policies all but ensure that alumni will be reluctant to donate back to the school that charged them tens of thousands in tuition while failing to provide basic services such as adequate space in classes, permanent e-mail addresses, etc. 

Penny wise, pound foolish. That’s UCSB for ya."

He was raised by Mexican immigrants in a low income household. Him and his family had to move out a few years ago because it was too expensive to live in IV any longer. 


I did some research on Wikipedia and found this quote as well, to add to the timeline:


&gt;Starting in the 1970s, Isla Vista became more and more dominated by students from UCSB and nearby Santa Barbara City College. As UCSB grew and expanded its enrollment, the economic power of the relatively affluent students drove non-student residents out. The late 1960s upheaval destroyed a raft of organized activities that once occupied students' time, and into the void a free-form party scene took hold, resulting in throngs of young people gathering on Friday and Saturday nights on Del Playa Drive, the street that hugs the southern blufftop of Isla Vista.


So basically low income native Isla Vista residents were kicked out of Isla Vista so that upper middle class kids could have a dedicated place to party. SBCC students are arguably the worst, since they don't even have the excuse of it being so close by.


I know that UCSB is a very liberal school, and many people here have problems with gentrification in cities like Los Angeles and Brooklyn, but I find it ironic/hypocritical that they are part of the problem pricing out actual Isla Vista/Goleta natives."

So here's the deal, fellow Redditors. I recently joined the amazing Ombuds office. As I started out, I joined a meeting to promote International Ombuds Day. I got this idea to join forces with UCSB Recreation and their Campus Challenge event that seeks to recognize UCSB as one of the greatest outdoor schools. The idea I hatched was to have an outdoor event to both win points for the outdoor challenge and promote the special work we do for students, staff, and faculty as your confidential Ombuds.  I am hosting a camp-coffee brew-up at Goleta Beach starting at 7AM tomorrow. I'll fire up a camp stove and grind and brew coffee. The event will take place on the last table at Goleta Beach -- the one nearest to UCSB. The only way to access the event until 8AM is via bicycle, skateboard, or on foot. 

Perhaps I got a little too, well, specialized with this event. But I know there are people out there who are into the #CoffeeOutside lifestyle. It's darn fun to create an experience that incorporates some fo the best elements of backpacking and bikepacking. 

If you're out there, coffee and bike people, join me. I'll have coffee to share but if you are looking for an excuse to fire up your camp-cooking kit, bring your kitchen with you. Others should bring a mug or cup. 

Just like the Ombuds office, this event is open to all.

After a few months of issues I'm now basically certain someone working at the CVS by Storke and Hollister is either intentionally shortchanging my necessary meds or stealing them. (They do have potential for abuse but I need them for real).

I'm short about a weeks pills from a month's supply of one and they marked a two week supply of a med as 30 day preventing me from getting a refill right before winter break (it was not cool).

I'm going to speak to my doctor's office about it but is this something I call the police department about immediately or should I wait until I speak to the doctor's office?

It's two different doctor's scripts because one is a specialist btw so it isn't the doctor's office I don't believe."

We've been gathering information and eye witness accounts about what happened and I just wanted to post something to make something clear to the person that stole my guitar: me and my bandmates know what you look like, we know that you were drunk, and we know where you were walking towards. Because this guitar is worth enough to make stealing it a felony and we don't want to ruin anyone's life just because they were drunk, me and my bandmates are giving whomever took it a chance to give it to us for a reward, otherwise we are giving all of the information we have to the police and we will let them deal with it from there. Also, if anyone has any information about anyone posting about stealing a guitar that looks like the photo below in a snapchat story or something, that will also be rewarded.

Sorry they aren't privileged enough to have paid sick leave like you are, and that management is putting them in a tough situation they wouldn't want to be in themselves. They are just trying to do their job and serve everyone else who has to work, like the facilities management crew who work day and night to keep campus clean, or to serve people like you who do have the privilege to practice social distancing and choose not to. Service workers were not granted the privilege of being able to practice social distancing right now--my friend at the UCen should not have been called a ""stupid f\*\*\*ing b\*tch"" for coming into work like she was asked to do, especially since she would have rather been at home herself. And if you are studying in a huge group at the lib when asked to practice social distancing, you really are in no position to be critiquing the cleanliness of these dining institutions, let alone dehumanizing the people who work there and are just trying to get by like everyone else, you absolute hypocrite. Have some sympathy. So if I catch you giving service workers crap for DOING THEIR JOB supporting the UCSB community, I will not hesitate to tell you to go screw yourself. Or just deny service to you.

Sincerely,

The girl who just made you your five dollar latte.

P.S. Sorry that if you want your Yerba someone has to sell it to you, idiot."

fsoj0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/fsoj0a/read_if_youre_worried_about_unsubmitted_grades/,READ IF YOU’RE WORRIED ABOUT UNSUBMITTED GRADES,11,18,2020-03-31 17:03:53,"I keep seeing posts asking about unsubmitted grades. In response to all of them and what will likely be an onslaught of posts asking about NG/NR grades tomorrow since many professors are probably too busy right now to submit grades, I wanted to make a small post. 

1. The deadline to submit is 11:59 PM March 31, 2020. If you don’t have a grade, it’s probably because your professor is busy or forgot to submit them in the midst of all this chaos. 

2. Classes with no grades by the deadline will show either an NG = No Grade or NR = No Record. **This does not mean you automatically fail, etc.** Take a deep breath.

NG means no grade was submitted for YOU. NR means no grades were submitted for the ENTIRE CLASS.

More info (Search NG or NR in the search bar): https://ucsb.intelliresponse.com

At this point, according to the guidelines above, you might e-mail the Professor a gentle reminder. But, given the extraordinary circumstances, I would try to give them a few more days if you can afford to. Professors are empowered to change grades on Gold after the deadline so replacing an NG/NR is no problem for them. 

Of course, there are also many students who need to know their grades ASAP for things like meeting course pre-requisites, etc. In that case, emailing professors would be helpful. 

I hope I didn’t miss anything and this helps in some way. I just thought that a flurry of people unfamiliar with NG/NR would send a mass of emails to professors who are completely swamped with adjusting to the new formats and may be unable to respond in the usual timely fashion.

EDIT: If you're in a class with a section, you may have to deal with NR/NG for a while because you're TA might be withholding grades. I'm not sure how this would play out; the website above gives some idea of what happens to NR/NG grades at the end of the following quarter. The best bet is likely to contact your TA. Maybe someone can provide better information on this aspect."

Everything about the way out final quarter is playing out is absolutely heart-wrenching but please realize how narrow the scope (of most) of our problems truly is. Let’s be grateful that we aren’t losing jobs that are borderline meaningless to us. We should feel so relieved that we aren’t scrambling to find a way to feed a family, without a job.

No. But is it a coincidence that cheating is increasing when departments are opting out of P/NP and some professors are assigning 2+ times the amount of work, ignoring their students pleas to slow down, are basically forcing students to teach themselves, are grading harshly, are not going to curve the class, and so on? Also no. If a professor is going to be unreasonable, odds are their students are going to be unreasonable too.

Philosophically, I like to assume I will be tipping 15% of the cost of a course on a per unit basis (e.g. 0.15((CA Res UG Fees - Student service fee - AS/GSA fee - lock in fee)/(total quarter units))x(course units) ) and then I adjust the tip-percentage up or down depending on the quality of my professor. Now it’s all up in the air! 

I can’t fathom tipping so gratuitously when the experience of online instruction is drastically different. Implicit in the social agreement we make to tip our professors is the assumption that they will go out of their way to ensure we have the finest instruction, a sophisticated educational ambiance, and thoughtfully crafted course materials...that is all lacking from the experience now.

Mediation is free, and can be a great way to resolve disputes in a fair way. Please let me know if this would be beneficial to you, or just drop general housing-related experiences that you're having right now.

Examples of potential issues that can be mediated include:

* Non-payment of rent and the need to work out a payment plan in the future (per applicable regulations prohibiting certain evictions during this public health emergency)
* Confusion about responsibility of rent payment between housemates if some are temporarily relocating from Isla Vista while others are staying home during this public health emergency
* Disagreements regarding security deposit returns as leases turnover and many residents are out of the area
* Disagreements between housemates and/or neighbors that are heightened during the stay-at-home period
* Concerns about housing/property conditions as many residents are spending longer periods of time at home

This clearly is not only a public health crisis, but a financial one. Anything we can do to assist in the process, we want to help.

guct6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/guct6h/everyone_wants_an_inperson_fall_quarter_but_at/,"Everyone ""wants"" an in-person fall quarter. But at what cost?",48,33,2020-05-31 20:09:12,"I really, really, do understand the difficulty of learning in the ""Zoom University"", and the mental health issues of being isolated.  

So when I see folks saying that they really, really want classes to go back to being face to face... I get it.  I really do.

We can and should do a better job of supporting one another after having had a quarter's worth of experience. And perhaps even just coming together in the dorms and having some on campus services that can be delivered face to face, one on one, with distancing and masks; maybe this will help.

But.  I want to live. 

Think of the staff and faculty at UCSB that have helped you in your journey.   No doubt there have been some you are grateful for.  And maybe a few that you could live without.

Here's the thing: you don't get to pick.  If we have an in person fall, a few of them are going to die painful deaths, alone in an ICU, because you insisted on returning to face to face classes too soon.

And it might be your favorite professor.  That adviser that went out her way to help you get into that class you needed.

Face to face classes, in Chem 1179? In Buchanan? In Broida?   In Lotte Lehmam or IV Theatre?   Do you really remember how jammed in against one another we all were?   How much crowding there is crossing the bike paths at rush hour?   

If faculty are forced against their will to teach in person in fall, I predict a lot of sudden retirements and resignations resulting in cancelled courses.

Your faculty aren't 18-22 year olds.  

Our chances of ending up dying a painful death, alone in an ICU, are orders of magnitude larger than yours.

The fact that the administration is even considering in person options for Fall, given that we have no credible plans for social distancing at lecture hall scale, or even for discussion sections at scale (given our shortage of physical classrooms) is frankly, irresponsible.   It shows a callous disregard for the safety and welfare of the faculty and staff, not to mention students with medical complications such as diabetes, etc. that increase the risks of serious illness and death.   

The CSU system made the right call.  It's anyone's guess why the UC leadership is taking so long to follow suit.  I really hope that the UC leadership finally steps up and does the right thing.   They sometimes  do, but only after first exhausting every available alternative.

Still not convinced? Have you read about what it's like for people my age (55) or my husband's age (64) that get a serious case of Coronavirus disease?   Ask a friend or relative that works in an ICU in an affected area what it's been like.   Or go read about it.

The responsible thing to do, the grown up thing to do, is to accept that we will need to continue doing the best we can with remote teaching and learning for at least a few more months. It's not what any of us want.  

But until we have the tools to return to face to face teaching without ending up with dead staff and faculty, not to mention students, it's the only responsible choice."

You made one major miscalculation, my friend, in your duplicitous quest for complete and total domination of the Hunt at the expense of the other innocent, uncorrupted, and virtuous Scavenger Hunters: the clue you took was entrusted to the watchful eye of none other than the Panda.  That’s right - you have unwittingly released the wrath of the Great and Powerful Bamboo Garden Panda whose fury is about to rain down on you, and rain down hard.  Miss your turnoff in the roundabout?  Bamboo Garden Panda.  Didn’t get that class you needed in the first pass?  Bamboo Garden Panda.  Ketchup packets missing from your takeout?

Plus if we’re still going to class we’re still exposed to people on the way. For the labs or classes we physically go to theres still a chance to be exposed bc people have probably sat there or touched something causing a risk for exposure.

h7b8iz,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/h7b8iz/a_letter_to_isla_vista/,A Letter to Isla Vista,231,32,2020-06-11 18:26:45,"A few rare times in the passing of our lives, our hearts get snagged by a place, person, or pocket of time. Isla Vista (or IV as I will hereby affectionately refer to it as) caught me in this way, and now it’s almost time for me to give it up. I used to tell people that I wanted to write a book about my experience here: I doubt that will ever happen, but I’m deathly afraid of leaving this place, so I want to try to capture my feelings on paper.

&amp;#x200B;

This is my love letter to you, IV.

&amp;#x200B;

It took me three years to write because my time here seems like something out of a fever dream. Calling it a dream would be unbecoming: the memories are far too visceral. I’m honestly unsure whether or not some of the memories are real. The subterranean jazz concerts, the late-night ocean swims, skipping class to climb a shipwrecked sailboat... standing knee-deep in the languid swells while Leopard Sharks circle your feet. I look back on running barefoot across Deveraux beach on a moonlit night with my friends, laughing and yelling and whooping, and even now these thoughts are infused with the hazy mist of surrealism.

But it’s not just the memories that make me characterize IV as I do. It is specifically the non-memories, those strange and wonderful normalities which we’ve all become accustomed to that constantly remind me that I live in a strange and unfamiliar world from the quiet suburbs I grew up in. The shirtless surfers, biking to the beach. Leaving the front door open to get a whiff of the ocean breeze. The people suntanning on their roofs. The boys tossing a football between houses separated by an ocean cliff. They all amalgamate into this primal and electrifying feeling that I associate with IV.

&amp;#x200B;

To experience IV is to be blissfully alive.

&amp;#x200B;

So I was dragged by the undercurrents, along for the ride but completely unprepared for the life IV showed me. It taught me to embrace the weird and spontaneous. It taught me a passion for all things which make the world beautiful. It also taught me that sandals are appropriate for any setting. Most of the time, footwear is optional. I’m so not ready to leave, but IV is transient by nature. You’re given 3 years, maybe a few more if you’re lucky. Knowing that this world will soon become a distant memory makes you grasp onto it as hard as you can, even as it slips through your hands like water on a warm day.

&amp;#x200B;

So we dig in our heels and try to hold onto the endless summer.

&amp;#x200B;

It is 8 AM and I am barefoot in my yard, feeling the soft sun warming the pavement. A stranger waves to me as she roller skates by. It is 3:15 PM and I watch a group of people set up hanging tents high in the trees to spend the night cradled by the windswept canopy. Their hearty canvas laughs fill the air. It is 7 PM and I look up from the water at the Santa Ynez mountains just as they are stained a deep royal purple by the sunset. I turn back and dive headfirst into the break of the wave.

&amp;#x200B;

The other day a woman called to me from her window: “Enjoy your youth while you can!”

&amp;#x200B;

What a strange and wild city! It saddens and frustrates me that I’ll never be able to express all of my feelings sufficiently, but some must be left behind for those who have lived in IV to understand in unspoken empathy. So before I set adrift once more, slipping into unconsciousness, I look back with an aching heart and end upon this thought of the Crystal Ship. At night, the oil rig off the coast lights up, and just about everyone who’s spent time in IV has at one point stared out at those guiding lights. From the beach, it looks like a collection of diamonds, suspended out on the water. Story has it that back when IV was the counterculture Mecca of the ’60s and ’70s, Jim Morrison sat on the cliffs of IV late in the night and wrote the song “The Crystal Ship” about the shimmering vision he had of the oil rig. This myth has been debunked for me by a long-standing resident, but that vision of a crystal ship still shines through my mind in the same way it lights up the dark California coast.

IV is *the* Crystal Ship. Even as its oceanside balconies collapse into the dark churning waters below, it shines through the night as a lost city, signaling open arms for anyone in need of love. IV is a bubble: both timeless and ephemeral, equally terrifying and electrifying. It’s extraordinary. I’d like to imagine that long after it’s eroded away--reclaimed by the ocean which gave it life--IV will continue to shine, immortalized by memories and legends as something to aspire for. There will always be hazy nights of jazz. There will always be sharks circling the waters. I will forever be running barefoot on that moonlit beach. And when it’s long gone they’ll tell stories. I imagine they’ll start with: “There used to be a city on the coast of California which stood as a testament to youth, a testament to life, a testament to love.” Isla Vista, I love you: now and always.

&amp;#x200B;

When I wake from this dream, please still be there.

&amp;#x200B;

(All my love, Brad)"

Is this not hypocritical and something that should be addressed and presented for discussion? It's not like there aren't plenty of POC at UCSB, so why do your sororities not reflect that? How you goin have a ""sisterhood"" if you ain't got no sisters ? 

Donating and signing petitions is performative activism when you have the power to be better and do better. Recruit a more diverse group of members, and facilitate an environment that celebrates and invites different ethnicities and cultures. Don't just talk about it, be about it.

Edit: One of the best thing to do to be an ally to POC is to include them and represent them equally within your institution. They can put their words to action and actively work to create a more inclusive and racially diverse culture within their sorority. 
I'm not into cancel culture, just discussion, education, and growth."

At the end of every quarter this year, I have felt a lot of guilt that I didn't study hard enough or do enough and procrastinated too much. I feel like I have carried a lot of bad study habits from high school and I am working on reestablishing better habits. But it doesn't stop me from getting less than ideal grades and ultimately feeling guilty about it. I have been seeing alumni post about their grades and it does bring me some comfort, but I also know that everything just keep getting more competitive.

he4rz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/he4rz1/my_findings_as_a_ucsb_studentlaws_of_studying/,"My Findings as a UCSB student,Laws of studying that will improve your GPA drastically when understood",13,4,2020-06-22 17:57:24,"In my experience studying I have come across a simple Law in studying that I've noticed to be true in every case, the Law I present is as follows:

Once you put down the pen, there is a chance you'll never touch it again, regardless of intent. (1)

This law can be then rephrased, and combined with another simple observable study law to form its more useful generalization:

Breaks will never be shorter than you intend for them to be, but they can be longer. (2)

(1) and (2) form the conceptual backbone of which I have developed a theory to go about studying and staying motivated, as well as allowing me to have more fun in social situations. 

What do these laws mean? 

The laws simply state what we already know. Starting things is hard. When we take breaks, we often allow ourselves extra time by finding things to distract us. ""I want to check my phone for a little longer, I want to go to the bathroom, I need to go to the arbor, etc."" We find ways to make our ""I'll just take a quick break"" into a ""Oh my God I've wasted 45 minutes."" 

We all know this happens to us, and we've all done it. So why does it need to be said? Because we keep lying to ourselves, and we keep falling for it. Why do we fall for these little lies? When we know we're going to take a big break, but convince ourselves we won't? The reason I think these laws are better stated as laws, rather than suggestions, is because if you can keep them in your head, its harder to lie to yourself. 

An application:

I am a student who would like to get my homework done, and also have a social life. 

When working, I do not take many breaks. I go to class, and in between class, I go to the library. I work and I work. When I stop, usually at the end of my last class or if I get in a routine some set time, I stop. I can be at school from 9-3 and get 3 hours of productive work done while going to three classes. And here's another thing to keep in mind:

When we work, we must only count it if its **productive work**. This means the phone is off and you're in the zone. This is maybe the hardest part of making this work, but as someone who is in a rigorous major, I can promise you that you can complete nearly any course-load on time with only 3 hours of productive work a day. The benefit of this is that you have no long all nighters, you have your entire day after 3pm to be social, take it easy, have a job, etc. The downside is that going to class feels more like work than it does feel... like going to class, and thus carries some emotional weight feeling like one. Some might argue that you should be treating school as a job, but this tradeoff is something to consider at least.

Other Applications:

Obviously I've just said how I do things. Think about a few other situations that may be more pertinent to you:

Your friends want to go out and do something, should you stop your essay writing because ""I'll work on it more later tonight"", which may not happen, or just write for an extra half hour and forget about it tomorrow? (2)

You're smoking weed with your friends. They're heading to Cloud 9 and you wanna join, but you tell yourself ""But I need to write my essay later!"" Are you going to really write that essay? This example is a showcase of how my philosophy can increase social pleasures as well. If the pen is down, it will not suddenly lift itself magically in a few hours, you must be there lifting it. So when it is down, sometimes its better to just let it sit while you enjoy yourself and stop worrying about it. Stress is a real problem with college students, you need to learn to let go when you can. (1)

The main key to this is momentum. It takes a massive amount of energy to start something, even when coming back from break. If you can condense your days to a few extremely productive hours, you'll be a lot better situated than 9 unproductive hours of doing one problem and looking at your phone for a few minutes. Tell these laws to yourself when you're about to take a break. It's better to work 2 hours and take a 30 minute break than to plan to work 2 hours and take six 5 minute breaks. 

People say this is hard, to be motivated and  study rigorously. I say its harder to not. I finish assignments days before they're due and don't stress outside of midterms or finals. I can't imagine how difficult it would be to manage my time if 1 page of an essay would take me an entire day, versus a few concentrated minutes.

This whole online classes situation really kicked my ass and I am grateful most my professors opted out of having us do exams instead having quizzes and hw be our grade. So that means I only had one class with an actual final project and I bombed it. Every day this week I would sit down to get it done but I just was unable to focus on something that needed that independent motivation, my home just doesn't feel conducive for school work but maybe that's just an excuse idk.

 I just needed to rant, cause it really makes me question if I'm good enough to even be attending this school."

It sounds like Fall is going to be online or hybrid which will cut my short 2 years down even shorter. Participating in research is incredibly important to me (especially bc I'm coming from  community College where research is nonexistent) which makes the cut even harder for me (long term goal is graduate school). Also, I actually applied to CCS out of high school but didn't make the cut so I've been looking forward to joining this community for a while now. Anyway, because of all this I'm considering deferring my enrollment. Anyone have experience here? Is it even possible? Would you recommend it?"

&amp;#x200B;

Academics:

* 95% of all seats in classes will be remote
* Possible that all courses will be online depending on the Governors recommendation or the Dept of Public Health
* UC Berkeley/UC Riverside are both all online initially due to restrictions from the local Dept. of Public Health so it is possible we will be too.
* For students who do have in person classes, if they are held, they will be required to wear masks. Any refusal to wear a mask will be referred to the Office of Student Conduct; i.e face suspension.
* The Dean of Undergrad Education is currently discussing whether making all instruction after Thanksgiving remote and said ""if it was up to me, yes""
* In person classes will not increase even if the situation gets better between now and the end of September

Gym:

* When reopening, there will be a reservation system for the gym. It is unclear when it will be reopen
* Facilities have been reorganized; basketball will not be offered. Fitness equipment has been moved into the basketball court to allow for spacing of equipment.
* Facial coverings will be required at all times. If you do not have one, one will be provided.
* Facility hours may be reduced
* If you want a job with them, go to their website.

Housing:

* Contracts can be cancelled without a fee until Sept 1 
* It is currently being decided by Greek housing managers whether members will be able to move in in the fall; unclear when that decision will be made but they are working with Office of Student Life to decide
* There are a lot of decisions for housing that still need to be made and it may change
* Housing offers are depending on the Governors approval and they are awaiting his approval, they hope it will be this week
* As of right now, the plan - if approved - is to have single occupancy in the dorms.
* Apartments/quads may still be doubles
* The plan is to honor all contracts that were already signed; i.e those signed in Feb
* At this time, only 1/3 of freshman who requested to live on campus will get a spot
* Lottery will be used to determine who gets a spot
* Any winter/spring housing will be based off availability for those not already living on campus but language will be added to contracts to indicate that if the COVID situation improves, any singles can be turned into doubles/triples
* Dining will be take out only
* Unclear if off-campus meal plans will be offered this year

There's been fake manga covers and fanfiction of Stanford/UCB, Harvard/MIT, Harvard/Yale, UCB/UCLA, UCLA/USC, Brown/Columbia, and now I've even seen UCSD/SDSU! (I changed it from ""Berkeley"" to ""UCB"" just for you u/goldenbear2023)

And yet somehow, I haven't seen a single post on this subreddit or anywhere on Facebook that ships UCSB/Cal Poly SLO. I know that y'all artists, writers, and weebs are out there, especially on this godforsaken website, y'all need to get cracking on this shit so I can traumatize my friends instead of them traumatizing me with the filthy stuff they send me.

If you need ideas for titles, I'd point you to those Facebook pages, especially UCBMFET. Instead of ""My Little Public Uni"", you could easily do a title like ""My Little CSU"" or ""My Little Polytechnic"". You can also get inspiration for titles from these websites which compile a bunch of yaoi and yuri manga (may be NSFW, I haven't read any of these). For yaoi (male/male relationships): [https://www.manga.club/book/genre/Yaoi+Manga/](https://www.manga.club/book/genre/Yaoi+Manga/). For yuri (female/female relationships): [https://www.anime-planet.com/manga/tags/yuri](https://www.anime-planet.com/manga/tags/yuri).

I’m thankful to be a fairly health person (not in the head tho lol :)) but it’s just something extra to worry about that I don’t want to deal with. My COVID school routine is something I’m very comfortable with now and I think my return back to school will ruin all that comfort I have. 



Sorry for rambling, but I’m just slightly worried of what’s to come in the nearby future."

I believe they’re putting people in El Dorado, Westgate and San Clemente. I confirmed with a person from housing that westgate and San Clemente would be opening to those people, but idk about el dorado.

If anyone can offer advice I would appreciate it.",23,16,2020-09-13 19:17:11,"Throwaway. I don't know if this is an appropriate place to ask this but I'm starting to feel desperate and I don't know what my options are. I'm working to schedule time with my academic counselor but because of our current situation with COVID, she's super booked.    


I'm a sophomore SBCC student, hopeful prospective transfer, and I'm in a rough situation right now. I'm taking three tough classes; Calculus II, Physics 121, and Chemistry 155. At the start of the semester, I was told I'd likely be activated as emergency firehand crew. This potential situation would be horrible because it would likely sink my chances of transferring to UCSB this next cycle. I'm a physics major, and these three core classes are a super important consideration for my transfer. I should also mention I have ADHD and get distracted easily and feel like I haven't fully developed positive study habits to succeed in these classes. I was already incredibly anxious of the online medium and wasn't confident in my ability to take enough away from the material and to pace myself. This may due to impostor syndrome, I don't know. Another hurdle was that was also moving the first week as well, so this also took time away from me.  


Long story short, I'm over a week behind in my physics class and haven't been practicing much of any homework problems. I've done a decent portion of it, but haven't made time to really understand it. I haven't done any of the quizzes. I missed deadlines to a lab and a quiz. I'm about to possibly miss another two tonight.  


I'm really struggling in Calculus II. I'm like... 2 and a half weeks behind. I have a \~48%, combined, on 4 of the homeworks, largely because I didn't meet the deadlines (even WITH a granted extension).  


I'm doing okay in chemistry.  


**What I want to know...** What the heck are my options? I don't want to fail or drop my classes, but I'm starting to feel more and more hopeless as time goes on. Catching up feels impossible. I don't know what my options are. I have a 3.7 right now and I don't want to accept poor grades. I also don't want to drop my classes, I depend on the GI Bill as a source of income and this would effectively obliterate my ability to pay rent. Am I screwed? Can I come back from this? These classes feel impossible. Are there resources to deal with stress? Can counseling actually do anything? I don't feel like I can ask any more from my professors because I don't think it's fair. This is the end of the third week and our first tests come up next week.  


I really hope I'm not boned. Thank you early to anyone who takes the time to read this and offer advice, and I also apologize in advance if this is messy. I can't think straight."

He got confused thinking his community college would send his transcript, and later found out he was supposed to email an unofficial copy directly. 
He emailed it to them, but for some reason was not allowed to enroll in the classes for the first round, and he was told to wait for the second round. But now there is a waitlist, and he cannot even add himself because he is not enrolled in 12 units. 

Now, I have a few questions. In case he does not get in to any of these classes:

1) is there a deadline by when he is supposed to take one or both (i.e. classes need to be completed at the latest by first winter quarter after transferring)? 

2) what classes do you recommend he takes this fall quarter? And, of course, they would have to be classes he can enroll in (no pre-reqs for them and so on). I imagine there are other graduation requirements he could tackle. I am also thinking he could add these classes now in order to reach 12 units and be able to get in the waitlist.

To be honest, the whole process since he was admitted has been a nightmare. And although I understand we are living in difficult and confusing times, I expected more from this institution. It is very disappointing and discouraging. He has tried contacting many people in different departments for other issues he has had in addition to this one, and everyone has been impossible to reach or unhelpful.

However, reading again the pre-major policy, it seems that PSTAT 109 is no longer mentioned anywhere.

jjhv9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/jjhv9p/the_santa_barbara_police_department_is_seeing_an/,The Santa Barbara Police Department is seeing an increase in bicycle thefts.,1,2,2020-10-27 22:11:52,"The Santa Barbara Police Department is seeing an increase in bicycle thefts. Bicycles are commonly stolen after they are left unattended in publicly accessible areas. Many bicycle thieves carry tools and target bicycles with low-end locks that can be defeated with inexpensive, readily-available tools. Thieves have more recently been targeting high-end bicycles that are inadequately secured to vehicles (i.e. in the bed of trucks or attached to vehicle mounted bike racks).

SBPD has taken reports for over 320 stolen bicycles this year, 159 of which were valued over $950. With the increased usage of exotic, lightweight materials, as well as batteries, bicycles are becoming more and more expensive. Bicycle thefts are often unreported, because owners do not have serial numbers or suspect information. On average in the U.S., only 56 percent of bicycle thefts were reported to the police.

Here are some things to remember to decrease the chances of becoming a victim:

Store your bicycle indoors, in a bicycle locker, or inside of a locked vehicle. If you must leave your bicycle unattended outdoors, use a U-style lock. Most bicycle locks on the market only serve as deterrents to theft. Cable or chain-based locks are easily overcome by inexpensive, readily-available tools.  

Register your bike. [SBbike.org](https://SBbike.org) [https://www.sbbike.org/registration](https://www.sbbike.org/registration), one of the region’s bicycle advocacy coalitions, works with the non-profit Bike Index [https://bikeindex.org/](https://bikeindex.org/), a national bicycle registry. Take a photo of your bike when you buy it, identifying any distinguishing features; Bike Index accepts photos to assist others in identifying your stolen bike. It’s a helpful tool to increase the chance of being reunited with your bike. The link to the national site claims they’ve helped recover more than $12M in bikes.

Record the serial number of your bike, as well as the make, model and other features. The serial number is the most important piece of information -- it’s the only way of identifying a bike beyond all doubt. All bikes have a unique serial number, usually engraved beneath the bottom bracket (the part of the frame that the pedals go through). Stolen bicycles are often repainted, or otherwise modified to change their appearance. A serial number is the most definitive way to identify your stolen bicycle.

File an online or in-person police report, with your bicycle’s serial number, immediately after the theft occurs. If the bicycle cannot be matched to a police report, there are fewer tools at the officer’s disposal to recover the bike, if seen."

First off, take a deep breath. 1 quarter doesn’t decide your chances for med schools. B’s aren’t the end of the world if they happen. C’s aren’t death sentences. Shit happens, ppl get back up and still succeed and do amazing things. 

Use the search tool. People have asked “Does Price curve” “Does Joseph Curve”, etc. many times in the past. They do. People have also asked variations of “I bombed the mt how do I recover”. 

Gen chem, esp 1A has one of the most rewarding and nice curves ever. And the weighting really rewards people who improve on the final. The curve ends up saving so many people. And it might shock you to hear how wide of a net a C or a B really is if you only care about passing. But in terms of failing and still coming back:

Personal experience: 
Chem 1A mt grades: 65 75 75 Final: 95
Final grade: A

If you’re disappointed in how it’s going, seek out resources like your professor, CLAS, or change up your study plan. It really isn’t over till the quarter’s over. And even after you get your grade in GOLD, a B or a C doesn’t mean your a failure or that you can’t go to med school. Hell, ik ppl who retook gen chem and who aced ochem which most ppl find a lot harder and who have now gotten med school acceptances. 

Trust when I say it’s your first quarter and the first two mts in a long line of exams. Don't beat urself and bring ur mental health down esp rn during a pandemic. Yall got this!"

Like it was straight up an insanely depressing email about how life just ko'd me with 100 really hard things at once (even just one of them I feel should have gotten me more accommodations I feel) and I didn't even include some of the real dark shit, but it feels like they don't understand how much I'm going through. I have never even asked for help like this before and have a pretty high gpa and I'm a hard working student with a tough major and life hasn't given me time to breathe before slamming me down over and over. I'm also in a tough position where I can't drop any of my classes and I explained this too.


I'm going to work with caps soon, so hopefully that should help out right? I'm just wondering if anyone's been in a similar situation where they managed to get a better 'deal' from professors in really hard times and what they did to get better deadline extensions, easing on grading, really just anything to make surviving the quarter easier.

// this is gonna be kinda long I’m sorry but if anyone has any advice I would rlly appreciate it&lt;3

I’ve had a lot of mental health issues throughout my time at UCSB. while most of my grades are good now, as a senior I have a lot of W’s on my transcript and if I want to go to grad school I know that won’t look good. 

my freshman year first quarter I was a biopsych major and I realized that totally wasn’t for me so I made one of my chem classes P/NP (spoiler alert: I didn’t pass). I managed to pull barely-passing grades in my other courses and I was able to retake the chem class during a diff quarter and got a B, so that can sorta be explained if a grad school were to ask me about it. 

spring quarter 2020 I ended up late-dropping two classes, one GE and one special topics class in my major (194 course). my dad was sick I was having to take care of him everyday so by the time I had free time I didn’t have the energy to do all the work for my classes. I kept two classes, got a P and an A+, and the two I late-dropped were W’s. these I feel I have an “explanation” for as well, not just because of COVID but because of family health issues. 

one of the things that I can’t really explain or don’t want to really explain to a grad school would be the fact that my sophomore and junior year I got a W in the same class, both the first time I took it and when I retook it. I took this bio class in F18, which is the same quarter I ended up trying to kms. I came out of it okay but it took a huge toll on my studies. I was able to drop one of my classes and take deficit load of 8 units, made up by the bio class and another prereq class I was taking. I got a B+ in the prereq class and I ended up late-dropping that bio class, resulting in a W. The next year I tried taking the same bio class in F19. I tried to sit in class and focus but my brain couldn’t grasp the material and every time I forced myself to sit down and study I just kept putting myself down and thinking of everything that happened the previous year. It got to its worst point when I sat down early for class and I had a panic attack sitting in lecture because I couldn’t stop thinking about the previous year. Because of that, I late-dropped the class again. so now on my transcript two of my W’s are for the same class, one year after the other. I’m worried that because that’s already 4 W’s and two of them were for the same class that any grad school I apply to wouldn’t even give me a chance to explain myself because I’d be thrown out of the applicant pool early-on. 

this quarter has been particularly hard because my dad died a few months back and then my grandpa (dad’s dad) died like two weeks before school started. while it’s been nice to get some structure back in my life, it’s made schoolwork really difficult to keep up with. a dilemma with this that i’m currently having is that one of my classes quite literally makes me wanna die anytime I have to do assignments for it. it’s a special topics class in my major (again, 194 course) that was described as a programming class for beginners. I was really excited to take it at first but then everything started moving really quick and my friends and groupmates and I were all super confused. I sent the professor an email along with a few others and he was really receptive to our feedback. he changed many aspects of the course and due to some other emails about a week later he changed it completely again, which was honestly a blessing. I like the professor a lot and he really does listen to his students. but the problem I’m having is that because the dramatic course changes didn’t take place until weeks 4 and 5, I was already so far behind on content that there’s no way I could catch up unless I stopped sleeping and just worked solely on that class for 24-48 hours, which I’m not capable of doing nor do I want to do. I’ve been trying to do a little each day but we still have assignments due and I just can’t seem to catch up in time. I made the class P/NP about two weeks ago and was intending to pass the class, however I don’t really think that’s possible anymore. my major worry with NPing this is that this class is also a 194 course in my department, and I late-dropped a 194 course last quarter (S2020). even though the special topics classes were different, on a transcript they look like the same course because they have the same number, so a grad school would look at that and say, “oh, she dropped the class, then tried to retake it and failed,” seemingly similar to what happened with my bio class but not actually because they’re two different classes. but I have no way to show this to a prospective school. 

if I were to NP this class, I would then have 2 NP’s and 4 W’s on my transcript. coming from where I was freshman year I am overall proud of my accomplishments and how I’ve been able to do well in my major, but even with a personal statement explaining some of my situation I don’t think grad schools would see it that way. I am planning on taking a gap year after I graduate and to figure out more of what I wanna do, but I really just feel at a loss at this point. I don’t know what to do or how to remedy the fact that on paper I just look like someone who gives up all the time. 

if anyone has any input, advice, or maybe even a new perspective to offer i’d love to hear. if you’ve gotten this far, thank you for taking the time to read all of it!"

I wish I had made more socially active friends who I could go out with and have crazy adventures. I figured I’d have plenty of time to do that in the future but COVID hit halfway through my sophomore year and I still haven’t met those people I wanted to meet. That isn’t to say I don’t have great friendships that will last me a lifetime, but I find myself wishing that I had a regular group of people who go crazy on DP every weekend (not that going out to DP is advisable during the pandemic).

November 18, 2020  


**Dear Members of Our Campus Community,**  


I am writing to you with updates regarding instruction and housing, focusing on winter quarter, with an eye toward spring and summer. In making our decisions, we have taken into consideration a variety of challenges, including COVID outbreaks in California and across the country and the globe, state and local public health guidelines, and our concern about the living circumstances and density in Isla Vista. We have consulted widely and carefully, keeping as our highest priority the safety and well-being of our students and community in all of our planning efforts.  


**Winter Quarter – Academic Instruction**  
Like most counties throughout California, Santa Barbara County was reclassified this week into the most-restrictive purple tier in the State’s COVID- reopening system. Consistent with the updated [public health guidelines](https://t.e2ma.net/click/sgmugm/4x30ihb/0mclm7c), and given the current trend of increased COVID cases, UC Santa Barbara will join other UC campuses in **continuing to offer most of our undergraduate and graduate courses via remote instruction for the winter quarter**.   


We are, however, currently planning a small increase in the number of courses offered in person in winter quarter, as a step toward the possibility of greater in-person offerings in spring and summer. The courses available in winter will be mostly upper-division and graduate classes. Of course, our plans are dependent on public health guidance, which currently prohibits indoor lectures. The students and instructors in every in-person course will be required to comply with [campus testing protocols](https://t.e2ma.net/click/sgmugm/4x30ihb/gfdlm7c), and to follow physical distancing, face covering, and other required mitigation protocols. Classroom facilities will also adhere to required cleaning protocols. Additionally, as we did in fall quarter, we will continue to offer selected laboratory, performance, and field experience courses in a face-to-face format.  


While most graduate classes will continue to be offered remotely, some face-to-face courses are scheduled for the winter.   


Course information for the winter quarter has been posted to Gold.   


Recognizing that not all students are willing or able to return to campus for the winter quarter, the University is committed to making accommodations if a required course meets in-person in the classroom and a student cannot or does not want to attend in person. Our guiding principle is to ensure that students who are not in Santa Barbara or who continue their instruction remotely have a path to timely graduation. Departments will carefully consider how to ensure that students have an alternative option for fulfilling requirements, either by offering parallel remote sections, by repeating the course in another quarter, or by allowing students to substitute a different class to meet the requirement.   


Undergraduates with questions concerning courses or accommodations should contact Academic Advising:   


Letters &amp; Science: [academic\_advising@ltsc.ucsb.edu](mailto:academic_advising@ltsc.ucsb.edu?subject=Winter%20quarter%20instruction)  
Engineering: [coe-info@engineering.ucsb.edu](mailto:coe-info@engineering.ucsb.edu?subject=Winter%20quarter%20instruction)  
CCS: [info@ccs.ucsb.edu](mailto:info@ccs.ucsb.edu?subject=Winter%20quarter%20instruction)  


**Winter Quarter – Housing**  
Contingent on public health guidance and the incidence of COVID in our community, **we are planning to offer limited winter quarter housing in our undergraduate apartments**, with priority given to students who had campus contracts for the fall quarter. Our housing office will be sending out information to those students who applied for campus housing for the fall quarter to let them know their status. For questions related to undergraduate housing, please email [housinginfo@housing.ucsb.edu](mailto:housinginfo@housing.ucsb.edu?subject=Winter%20quarter%20housing).   


Our graduate and family student housing will remain unchanged from the fall quarter.   


We recognize that many students have challenges with remote instruction at home and would prefer to be on campus, even if they continue with remote instruction. Our plan to offer more campus housing is a cautious but important step forward to address the needs of our students and to begin to resume campus life. By opening some campus housing for fall and winter quarters, we are incrementally ramping up occupancy, which we plan to increase for the spring and summer quarters if the local public health situation allows.     


For winter quarter, we will limit occupancy to one student per room, based on UC and public health guidelines and best practices to mitigate the spread of COVID. **All undergraduate students living on campus will be required to undergo testing and sequester for a minimum of seven days upon arrival, and comply with our** [**campus testing protocol**](https://t.e2ma.net/click/sgmugm/4x30ihb/w7dlm7c)**, which currently mandates weekly testing.** All UC Santa Barbara students are also required to complete both an online COVID educational module and a [community compact](https://t.e2ma.net/click/sgmugm/4x30ihb/c0elm7c) through which students must agree to practice precautionary measures to mitigate the spread of COVID.  


Our housing plan is based on current COVID information and guidance. **If changes are made to public health guidelines and County regulations, the campus may be compelled to reverse course and maintain current restrictions on campus housing levels.** In that case, we may have to require our students not to come to campus housing. However, if changes occur after move-in, we are prepared to quarantine students who are living in campus housing and to increase testing frequency.   


**Increasing COVID Cases in Isla Vista**  
The density and occupancy levels in Isla Vista are still of overwhelming concern to us, especially given the number of COVID cases and continuing reports that some residents are disregarding public health orders regarding social gatherings and face coverings. Since the beginning of fall quarter, through our campus testing program and from self-reporting, we have identified 25 cases of COVID on campus and 186 cases in our neighboring community of Isla Vista, where an estimated 8,700 of our students live, as well as several thousand students from other local, California, and out-of-state colleges. The cases in Isla Vista represent a significant increase from what we saw prior to the start of the fall quarter, and are happening amidst surges elsewhere across the state, country, and around the world.    


We are deeply grateful to all of our students and community members who are following public health orders, taking seriously the directive prohibiting social gatherings, and complying with the COVID mitigation protocols that include physical distancing and the use of face coverings. However, to address the increasing number of cases, to protect our families and friends, and to help our Santa Barbara County community make progress in stemming the spread of COVID, we implore everyone, especially our students living in Isla Vista, to do their part, as our Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs wrote last month in a [letter to students](https://t.e2ma.net/click/sgmugm/4x30ihb/ssflm7c). We have also sent out a communication to our students regarding [Thanksgiving travel guidance](https://t.e2ma.net/click/sgmugm/4x30ihb/8kglm7c) to help minimize the risk of spreading COVID over the holiday break and endangering both students’ families and our local community.  


**Stop the Spread**  
Since the fall quarter began, our campus health and medical experts have significantly increased our testing capacity to more than 6,000 tests per week, and have substantially decreased the wait time on test results. Current plans will increase our testing capacity even further in the near future. After receiving CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) approval for an extension of our campus clinical lab to provide COVID testing, we are now able to produce test results in-house with a very fast turnaround time. We also have established partnerships with Fulgent Genetics and UCLA’s Computational Medicine Department to run additional diagnostic tests. Taken together, we have established a multi-pronged testing apparatus to serve our campus community. To complement our robust diagnostic testing protocols, we continue to use the expertise of our UC Santa Barbara faculty who developed a CRISPR-based COVID test for surveillance testing for our students, faculty, and staff.  


It is important to realize that testing alone cannot eliminate the possibility of an outbreak. Our testing and contact tracing can help identify and possibly contain an outbreak before it spreads widely, but our students need to play a much larger role in mitigating the spread in our community. We ask students who return to campus housing to refrain from socializing in densely populated Isla Vista. And we urge all of our students to strictly follow physical distancing and public health guidelines and always wear face coverings.    


If our campus community, along with the County, State and the rest of the country, can mitigate and even prevent the spread of COVID in the months ahead, we will be able to make more progress toward reopening more campus facilities and resuming more residential and instructional programs in the spring quarter and the summer. The more we can manage this pandemic, while awaiting the approval, manufacturing, and distribution of a vaccine, the sooner we will be able to bring more of our students, faculty, and staff back to the campus that we all miss so much.  


I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the members of our campus community who are making the necessary sacrifices to maintain our academic mission and to help slow the spread of COVID. It will take a concerted effort by each and every one of us to safeguard the health of our community, and to move toward increasing activities on our campus. Together, as a campus family, I know that we can rise to the challenge.    


Sincerely,"

I’m a freshman pre-bio major hoping to switch into data science. My attempt last quarter didn’t work out because the data science department said that I need to take 2 math classes at UCSB before switching. Fair. 
To stay on track for the major, I need to take Math 4A and CMPSC 8 (and some ges) this quarter. I got into a Math 4A section but it wouldn’t let me sign up for CMPSC 8 until Pass 3. Currently, I am #170 on the waitlist 🥴. I signed up for the equivalent course at SBCC because i figured this would happen, but I really don’t want to pay for it and the course will go beyond the end of winter quarter since it’s a semester class. Should I drop the SBCC course and try to crash CMPSC 8, or should I not bother with the waitlist?
Also, if anyone has insight on why the department won’t add more sections/lectures,, spill the beans— i’m curious."

First, I want to thank everyone who supported me when I made a post a while ago. It meant a lot to me, and I was able to keep myself motivated. I got out of my comfort zone and recently joined a new club, where I discovered people who share the same interest. I can't thank you all enough.

Now that finals week is almost over... I think that everyone is feeling empty and completely lost in life. *""What the hell am I even supposed to do now? Just lie in bed and make up for all the sleep I sacrificed for work and studying?""*

I think winter break is a great time for reconnection and self-reflection. Try messaging your family. Your friends. People who you haven't talk to for a while. Also, talk to yourself. ""What do I lack right now, and why do I need this? Why is this my goal? What do I need to do?"" This can range from your post-college life, interpersonal relations, or fixing your sleep schedule.

Taking myself accountable and keeping track of work was very difficult for me, so I recommend watching a few videos on project management and work break structures. Those helped me a ton when balancing my work shifts, midterms, and transfer applications.

One final thing I want to say is that you're not alone. This fall quarter was an absolute nightmare. COVID would most likely persist until who knows? But still, you've managed to survive. To those of you who are still taking finals, you've got this."

overall, i can't thank this ta enough for their understanding during a pandemic and their lenient but them helpful teaching/grading. unfortunately, this led them into getting in trouble with the prof for not being a strict enough grader and they was forced to regrade our lab reports to be lower because their sections' averages were too high compared to other ta's. is this even allowed--to have our lab reports be graded down retroactively? also they're at risk of losing their position if we tell the professor about anything, and overall i just think it's really unfair that such a kind ta could lose their job just because they didn't make their students' lives harder right now. i've honestly learned so much from their section because i felt like i could really focus on learning vs just submitting assignments on deadlines and i don't think having high section averages should reflect poorly on this ta but the other ta's who focused on grading strictly and not teaching as well. is there anything us students can do to ensure they doesn't lose their ta position?

With the tuition deadline behind them, students say they plan on withholding payment until the university’s administration agrees to both reduce the cost of attendance and increase financial aid by 10%.

Since this summer, members of the Columbia University-Barnard College chapter of Young Democratic Socialists of America (YDSA) have been gearing up to address ​“the injustice of exorbitant tuition rates” and ​“a flagrant disregard for initiatives democratically supported within the community.” Organizers say that at least 1,100 students are now actively withholding tuition, and a petition in support of the strike has so far collected more than 4,300 student signatures. 

Organizers with YDSA, the campus-oriented youth contingent of Democratic Socialists of America, have formed a coalition between student groups across campus, the graduate student workers’ union, and members of the surrounding West Harlem community to compile a list of demands that go beyond tuition and debt to address racism, public safety, fossil fuel divestment and gentrification. 

Students say they’ve already won a number of concessions. Over the past few weeks, the administration announced it would freeze tuition, suspend fees on late payments, increase spring financial aid and provide a limited amount of summer grants to students.”"

I’m posting because I’ve been seeing A2F posters up, and my partner actually ran into someone handing out fliers for them. 

My partner is Christian and found A2F their freshman year, and really loved the church. They went for a few months before some small flags started going up, and they decided to ask they people organizing what the organizations stance on being gay was. 

A2F told my partner that it was ok they were gay, that they could help my partner through this sin, and that many gay people were able to lead happy lives in heterosexual relationships. They gave my partner a whole speech about how God could forgive them for being gay. 

LGBT people, please be careful. Allies, please tell your LGBT friends if they are interested in joining the church. If you’re someone going to A2F or considering going, please, think about if your values align with A2F’s.

B4Grad has since grown and we got a major boost by the pandemic that the world has been facing.

We are looking for students to test the product as we launch several new features this upcoming semester including our note editor. You can send us the feedback via email or write a review on the App Store. That’s it.

And in exchange, we’ll give you the premium version of the app for free. It’s that simple. Just email us on the App Store page or you could message me here on reddit.

So a little more background here- I actually built B4Grad with the intention of making school simple to organize. I always felt like every professor in my program had a different style of doing things, and I thought an agenda wasn’t good enough of a tool.

I hope that B4Grad can serve as a good solution to that problem for some of you. Let me know if it has.

I’m currently taking 15 units and I’m thinking about dropping my chem1a + lab courses which means I will be at 10 units. I’m highly financial aid dependent and I’m worried that I will not be able to receive financial aid after dropping those courses. I recall from the past INT10 lecture about the census date (Jan. 26th) and how if we fall below the 12 units we will lose our Cal and Pell grants. However, since the census date passed does this mean I will be able to keep my financial aid? And will I need to petition for something because I will no longer be a “full-time student”? + are we allowed to add courses SOMEHOW after the last day to add has passed? I heard about this briefly somewhere but I’d like to make sure and be aware of everything I need to do if I actually do drop.

They still have a decent meal or two for each dining period every once in a while but it's kinda missed the mark for the past couple weeks, especially nutrition-wise. 

idk maybe it's just me but serving *half of a bell pepper with a little bit of rice and 4-6 pieces of steamed cauliflower* as an **entree** seems a bit insulting to those who have dietary restrictions but are being forced to pay for a meal plan. They want people to use the dining commons to avoid extraneous travel/outside contact with grocery shopping or eating at restaurants (and totallyyyy not to recover lost funds from previous quarters of limited operations), but people are still gonna have to grocery shop/eat out in order to make up for the lackluster protein and nutritional content of the meals they serve. Most of the meals only hit like 150-350 calories which is pretty low too

There are a few meals where you can just take the meat out, but so many that they serve are heavily meat-based so you're left with bread, pasta, and deconstructed salads :// i'd like to get some of your guys' opinions on this"

Across all four of my classes, I've finished maybe 2 homework assignments since the beginning of the quarter. For two of those classes, I haven't watched a lecture since week 1.

This morning I slept through a section for one of my upper divs. I made a huge deal about getting into this course and emailed the professor for weeks just to get in and off the waitlist. Now I just sleep through the sections. Well, this is the fourth one that I missed which according to the syllabus means I just lost 20% of my grade, and my professor and TA probably hate me as well. Fucking fantastic.

When I actually do make it to my live classes, I feel like an embarrassment to everyone else. I'm barely prepared, I can barely participate. I feel like a fucking fraud going to my honors section. I know I'm imagining it, but I constantly think that the other students are judging me for being a slacker and a failure.

On top of this, if I fail all of my classes this quarter, I'm going to lose my position as an honors student. This is the biggest source of disappointment in myself. I put so much effort into getting nearly perfect grades my first year so that I could apply to be an honors student, and now I'm just going to throw it away?

Honestly it feels like 2 weeks of winter break were so insufficient that my body and brain just decided to stay on break instead of returning to school. Since I took classes last summer quarter, it means that I haven't had a proper break from school in about eighteen months. I feel like I've reached the end of my rope and I can't bullshit my way back from this point.

But when I think about my college years, the years that people are supposed to grow up and lose their virginity, start forming intimate connections with girls, hooking up with girls left and right, and dating them every other week, I haven't done anything it seems I'm ""supposed to"" do.

something i learned in psy 102 that was interesting is negative affect reciprocity: when one individual instigates some sort of negative affect, another will add to that negativity so a cycle is created. i've seen an influx of negative, worried posts recently as it's been nearing the end of the quarter... and i absolutely relate to so so many of them. i mean, i'm a pre-med desperate to secure a good gpa despite zoom burnout and lackluster effort, i'm a freshman who's still disappointed/bitter about my lonely first year, etc. all the feelings being posted on here are completely valid and worth sharing because there's usually someone to find solidarity with.

but i want to break this negative affect reciprocity by saying that any progress, no matter how little it may seem, is still progress towards graduation and whatever your goals may be. sure, you might've gotten better grades in-person, but you are doing the best with what you're given. this version of best might be the same, a little less, or a little more than what you're used to but ultimately, it's still your best.

in the past week and a half, i've made progress by going to sleep at 2am instead of 5am then waking up before 11am. i finally summoned the courage to email my psychiatrist about the dsp forms she's been neglecting since last fall and got approved for the accommodations i needed. i even got 100% on my social psych midterm today after studying super hard for it, despite the days i f*cked up and just wanted to give up because my idea of the perfect routine was ruined.

if you want to share any goals you've accomplished lately, feel free to on here and i'll share your joy! i just wanted to remind everyone that even though life can seem to go wrong at every turn nowadays, just know you're still heading in the right direction. you've also got an anonymous reddit user in your corner :)

I thought I’d share my method to increase productivity. 

I’m copying my reddit post from r/youshouldknow :

YSK how to use the Ivy Lee Method to increase your productivity

Why YSK: The Ivy Lee Method is one of the oldest, simplest, and most effective productivity hacks that you can apply in your life.

Here is the way it works: each night before your day of work, write down your six most important tasks to do the next day in order of importance. The next day, you simply begin doing the tasks you wrote down one at a time.

This method is highly effective because you reduce decision fatigue and reserve your energy for your most prioritized tasks. If you don’t complete all of your tasks, simply add those unfinished ones to your list for the next day.

Your list should never have more than 6 tasks. Anything more will most likely be counter-productive

A response from the fin. aid office as to why we received less: ""Students received less of the funding for winter quarter because we are reserving part of the CRRSAA funds for summer emergency awards."" (this reasoning, imho, is stupid. The CARES grant gave UCSB $25,204,196 out of which a \*minimum\* of $12,602,098 was required to be given to the students. The CRRSAA grant gave UCSB $38,078,709 out of which a \*minimum\* of $12,602,098 (same amount as the CARES grant) was required to be given to the students. So why give out less even though you received $38M this time? Surely you could save up for summer grants using the leftover from $25,476,611, which in itself is more than the CARES grant?
2. This is pretty well hidden on the financial aid website but ""if you are a\[n undergraduate\] student that did not receive the COVID CRRSAA Grant nor the UCSB COVID Relief Grant but have experienced financial hardship due to COVID,"" you CAN appeal. Go ([here](https://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/covid-19/)) &gt; click on CRRSAA Fundamentals Fact Sheet &gt; look for the subheading ""Appealing for Support"" &gt; there is a link to a google form that will let you appeal."

I’m with the Community Financial Fund and saw that there were some questions regarding the grants from the Winter Quarter workshops. In our meeting yesterday, our advisor notified us that the list of approved students is still with the Office of Financial Aid. They are in the process of finalizing those grants and appear to be a bit backed up with everything going on.

Some students have already received their $200 checks as they qualified due to financial need. Some of our grants this time around were funded by Basic Needs, so these grants were approved ahead of the “regular” ones. (No, you will not receive two $200 checks if you already got yours). 

Hopefully this helps! We’re sorry about the delay and will provide more updates when possible. 

TLDR: Grants are in process of being approved by Financial Aid. Some people already got their money thanks to Basic Needs."

I really enjoyed physics in high school, but I want to learn it with more mathematical rigor. I want to derive everything, not just memorize the formula. I feel like I’m not learning anything in physics 1. 

I took 2 years of physics in high school and did very well, physics 1 has been a breeze so far. Do you think I should audit physics 22 next quarter to see if I like it? Maybe register for it instead of physics 2?

I’m not a physics major, so the potential GPA hit is a little concerning. Would getting an A be doable with 10-12 hours of work/week? 

If it’s relevant, I’m taking math 6A, Chem 1C, and a GE next quarter. I’ve done very well in previous physics/chem courses. Math is a little harder, but I wouldn’t say I’m bad at it.

I was proud of myself for the comeback. But every single quarter of online school since spring 2020 I've done terrible in because my mental health and motivation has just been garbage. NPs, failed classes that i then withdrew from, dropping classes three weeks in after falling way too behind. I don't have much of a drive anymore. Today I bombed my physics 4 midterm and immediately dropped the class after submitting it because I knew there was no coming back from that and now I'm down to only one class for the rest of spring quarter. 

I've gone right back to feeling stupid and incapable because i've spent this whole year being unable to keep up with school while plenty of others have been able to, and feeling extra bad for dropping late so late because then there's no refund. I can't help but think that the classes I DID barely pass (I got so many Cs) I could have done better if it wasn't for it all being online. :( I shouldn't feel bad but I do.

I was not admitted for my first choice (Communications) or my second choice (Cultural Anthropology) as a transfer. I'm currently attending Community College at PCC and I know my GPA is not super competitive, but I fit the bill for my second choice major and I want to at least try my best a second time to get in. I'll keep this short because I know everyone is busy with school and such!

1. I've read online that I should call in or email admissions to see why I wasn't admitted, is that actually a good idea? I would think it reflects badly on me, but hey... I didn't get in and I'm trying my hardest to somehow change that!
2. Should I wait until all of my Spring classes end to submit the appeal or should I appeal once it's available on May 1st?
3. Does anyone have any success stories from submitting an appeal? If so, what changed during the time between the rejection and the appeal, and what did you include in the appeal letter?
4. Would anyone be willing to message me or talk with me personally about my specific case and whether or not I should go through this? (I know this is a LOT to ask, but this is my only chance to further my college career as I've hit a dead-end in classes that I can take at my community college)

Many things have changed from when I submitted my Transfer Update. Most notably, I completely rearranged my class schedule for spring (taking 7 classes), I had Covid (I got really sick), I lost my job, and I found out that my uncle has stage 3 bladder cancer. I know the personal details may not help me at all, but it has been a really hard time being in online school and handling all of this. 

Anyways... Thank you for even reading this! It means a lot. I hope you all have a lovely weekend!

I've wanted to do this exchange since I visited campus when I was 16, now entering my third year of school I couldn't be more hyped to hopefully have it happen. 

I'm looking for all sorts of advice, housing, social and party life, clubs, frats, really just trying to get an understanding of what to do. 

Housing: I'd like to live off-campus to be away from the whole RA debacle etc., it seems like Isla Vista is the play for a good mix between academics and the other aspects of university life. Looking for advice on where to look for housing (saw some facebook groups, waiting for approval to join), what your experience was, and what I should do to try and maximize social life for the relatively short time period I'll be at UCSB.

Social and Party Life: I've heard many things, and I like those things. I go to a big school with a pretty good social aspect, I'm involved heavily with clubs and I ski competitively for the school, but I am very excited to experience university in the US. Are there clubs that host big events? Is it more of just a part scene in general where there's always something fun going on? Is greek life a big part of campus? I'm the president of the biggest club at my school which gives me a lot of opportunities to go out and whatnot so I never rushed a frat but I figure if I'm only at SB for a limited time, why not experience that too. Is it a possibility to join for just one term? And if so, is that a potential housing path? I'm probably going to take a smaller course load than I usually would in hopes of maximizing time spent in the ocean and with friends, really just looking to get the lay of the land here. If you have any advice to offer please drop it here, hyped to get amongst it!"

I am planning on attending a new school in Fall 2021 for a different major that I enjoy a lot more and is more aligned with my interests &amp; goals.**

For some (unnecessary) background, I got admitted back in Spring of last year as a freshman mechanical engineering major. Over the quarantined summer of 2020, I got bored asf as I assume a lot of you did and I decided to start coding just for fun (I decided to self teach myself C++) and I fell in love with CS. I learned so much over that summer from the basics to some more advanced topics like complex data structures &amp; algorithms, concepts in machine learning, basic game design &amp; graphics in Python, Git/version control &amp; other code-practice related stuff, etc. I worked on several exciting projects and I knew that there was no way that I would want to study ME for the next 4 years when I was so excited by CS.

So, I tried to switch my major to CS (which I knew was going to be a longshot) and I was placed on the waitlist for the major in the summer, but was unfortunately not able to get in before the Fall 2020 quarter started. So, I tried to switch to something more closely related to CS and changed from ME to Statistics &amp; Data Science in hopes of potentially transferring to CS somewhere down the road. Getting CS classes as a Stats &amp; DS major was rough, and for the past 3 quarters (Fall, Winter, and Spring) I've tried to get into a CS class (CS 8, CS 16, and CS 24) respectively and was unsuccessful each quarter since they just fill up so fast. Also, the STSDS major itself is not my cup of tea since I am more interested in machine learning/AI &amp; the theoretical side of computer science &amp; programming, which it does not really cover. I do appreciate what you learn in the major and see the value in what is being taught, but it really just isn't for me (it's more of a Statistics major than a Data Science one atm, but I see that it is improving).

I attended several change of major Zoom webinars in the Fall that were designed to lay out the rules for switching into a CoE major, but even the reps who presented at these meetings said that switching into CS is extremely, ***extremely*** unlikely (this opinion was echoed by my advisor, info on this reddit, and reddit posts by professors as well). I was losing hope of becoming a CS major at UCSB especially because I couldn't get into any of these classes and in the era of COVID, crashing a lower div CS class as a non-major freshman &amp; actually getting into it is essentially impossible.

So, I decided to make the most of the high GPA that I earned in order to even be considered to transfer to CS within UCSB and the side projects/things I taught myself over the summer and beyond. So, I applied as a sophomore transfer student in CS to other places (didn't want to put all my eggs in one very unlikely basket). I got accepted to some pretty great schools for CS, so I'm probably going to switch and transfer to one of them (where I have been accepted as a CS major) this coming Fall.

I really do wish *that somehow I could have ended up studying CS* here since UCSB has a lot of great things to offer with their CS department (excellent research opportunities, really small class sizes (relatively speaking, esp even for lower divs, and some really good professors, 5 year BS/MS, and instate tuition for me), but I guess it just wasn't meant to be.

**TLDR: This past year has been awful and quite stressful for me (although most of that isn't really UCSB's fault). I'm going to transfer to another school in the Fall, who do I talk to in order to make the transition as smooth as possible and so that I don't have to pay any/have fees for the Fall 2021 quarter on my account before I leave? I also plan on attending grad school in the future, so will my academic records still be available 3 years from now? I couldn't find any information about transferring out (only stuff about transferring to UCSB).**

Also, if you're thinking about switching to CS at UCSB or are interested in studying CS (and maybe you are in the same boat as I was in &amp; want some tips/help on transferring to another school for CS, whether you're currently a freshman or a sophomore) feel free to send me a PM on reddit, I'd be happy to give you some advice."

After reading previous threads where the OPs and/or commenters were able to pick up their honors cords, I decided to put in an order despite not receiving any sort of correspondence from the CoE honors program. However, my order isn't ready for pickup, which I believe means that they couldn't verify me. Has anyone else in the CoE been able to pick up a cord?

Just to clarify, I actually graduated last quarter and I completed the Honors program itself too. I don't believe this should make a difference, though."

o0v0m4,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/o0v0m4/a_warning_about_sage_corps_a_potentially/,"A warning about Sage Corps, a potentially predatory internship company",22,10,2021-06-15 19:51:58,"I wish I had known what I was getting into with Sage Corps. I’m a student in debt, and I lost $2000.

Sage Corps is an internship placement company that asks “top students” to pay thousands of dollars to do an unpaid internship. But I’m warning you that they are a potentially predatory company. If you really were a top student, why would you need to pay someone to do an unpaid internship?

First, Sage Corps hunts students down through their emails to university departments, asking them to spam their students. My university, unfortunately, did not foresee that I would become the company’s prey.

Their application process traps students. The interviewer only asked me a few behavioral questions, so there was no formal screening process—their claim of sending “top students” is shady. After the interview, I was asked to sign a binding contract and pay a $1000 initial deposit. But I had to sign this contract months before they placed me with a company. Little did I know that Sage Corps would later use the binding contract to extort $2000 from me.

During the two months following the contract signing, they helped me edit my resume—a service worth $5 on Fiverr.com—and gave me access to this “career accelerator program,” a compilation of around $100 worth of Udemy courses. The only thing I paid for with real value was the housing, provided through Sage Corps by a third-party, at $3000. 

But something unexpected happened related to COVID-19. When I asked Sage Corps if I needed a visa for my internship, they said I needed a CPT. So, I saw my university counselor, but he told me that since I was an international student who did his first year online and not in-person, I could not get CPT authorization. Sage Corps—despite knowing that I am a first-year international student doing online school—did not check beforehand whether I was eligible for the internship. Nothing on their website, unlike other companies detailing internship requirements, mentioned the need for a CPT. 

I informed Sage Corps I was not authorized to do an internship. They scheduled a call for me with the company’s CEO. He suggested I enter the US as a tourist to do the unpaid internship, pay for travel to and one-night stay in Canada after the internship, and return to the US to activate my F1 visa. Does this proposition, from a professional international internship company, sound legitimate?  

And the CEO failed to be reasonable and understanding throughout. When I asked for a refund because of circumstances that made it impossible to do the internship, he blamed me. He blamed me for circumstances caused by COVID-19. He even refused to give a refund minus Sage Corps’s incurred costs. 

I tried to reason with him through email, again and again. I let him know that my parents had to take loans to finance my education, so him taking thousands of dollars—for no mistake of my own—was a gunshot wound. 

More unreasonable was that he told me he had given us, this summer’s cohort, the wrong contract to sign. I was bound to a contract for a remote internship, which cost $2000. I never wanted to do a remote internship, and I made that clear from the start. 

So, even though he admitted the contract was a mistake, he said I had to do the online internship program or that he could only refund me $2000. He made me liable for his mistake, and he even tried to gaslight me. He said I failed to sign the new in-person-internship contract unlike the other students—but he never sent me this contract—and was obligated to pay $6800. He said he was making an “exception” to his policy by giving me $2000 of $4000 back. 

When I pleaded for at least the $3000 housing payment, he said Sage Corps has incurred costs like the resume editing and learning modules that have “already been activated and paid for.” 

But that was a lie. After refunding me $2000, he deactivated the learning modules. He could reverse the arrangement with Udemy all along. 

I’m a student in debt, and Sage Corps and its CEO tried to manipulate me to work without authorization, tried to gaslight me into thinking I’m to blame for COVID-19 circumstances, and bullied and lied to me. This is how a predator would behave: hunting me down, trapping me, deceiving and wounding me, and taking my money. 

Today, I’m $2000 more in debt because of Sage Corps. 

I hope my post will save you from Sage Corps and similar unethical companies and prevent you from making the same mistake I did: selling myself short and paying thousands for work.

Also, it looks like many of the apartments have already been leased - the soonest that myself and my other roommate can move in would be September 1st. Will any more new spots become available in the next few months, or is it pretty much going to be what's available/posted already? I get that it's impossible to predict the future, but I am more so asking about what it's been like in previous years.

In what may become precedence setting [legal cases](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/indiana-university-students-sue-school-over-vaccine-requirement-allege-constitutional-rights-violated/ar-AALktJz), three California State University, Chico, [students](https://californiaglobe.com/section-2/uc-csu-systems-announce-covid-19-vaccine-requirement-for-fall-2021-semester/) who have recovered from COVID-19 [are suing the state school,](https://www.sacbee.com/news/california/article252365048.html) saying the California State University system’s requirement that they receive a COVID-19 vaccine before returning to class in the fall places them at risk of dying.

Eight Indiana University students also [filed a federal lawsuit](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/indiana-university-students-sue-school-over-vaccine-requirement-allege-constitutional-rights-violated/ar-AALktJz) against the state school, alleging that its COVID-19 vaccine requirement violates both their constitutional rights and the state’s new anti-vaccine passport law.

Expect to see more of these lawsuits, and [this is why](https://www.foxnews.com/us/vaccine-mandate-protest-indiana-university):

 

I am convinced the IU vaccination mandate is unconstitutional,” said James Bopp Jr., an Indiana University alum and constitutional lawyer who has won nine cases argued before the U.S. Supreme Court. “A government school \[state school\] has to comply with the Constitution because that’s what the Constitution applies to, is limits on the government.”

Bopp said the mandate is an invasion of a person’s liberty and violates the 14th Amendment, which declares a state should not deprive a person of due process of law.

He also noted that both the medical and religious exemptions are also unconstitutional.

The CSU lawsuit was also filed in federal court in Sacramento on behalf of three students, and says all three contracted COVID-19 in January 2020 and subsequently recovered from the virus.

 

And that is the rub – people who had and recovered from COVID-19 have natural antibodies against the virus, and possibly even higher antibodies than those who are vaccinated. Because of that, many physicians say getting the vaccine on top of the body’s antibodies can be dangerous and lead to severe side effects and [vaccine injuries](https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2021/06/what_is_the_true_number_of_vaccinerelated_deaths.html).

The Sacramento Bee [reports](https://www.sacbee.com/news/california/article252365048.html):

 Federal and state officials have repeatedly said [the vaccines are safe](https://archive.vn/o/tejHO/https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/06/21/fact-check-vaccines-offer-safe-consistent-protection-covid-19/7609402002/) and that their distribution nationwide has largely staved off spikes in infections and allowed for [states to reopen ](https://archive.vn/o/tejHO/https://covid19.ca.gov/safely-reopening/)after more than a [year of protests](https://archive.vn/o/tejHO/https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article242946886.html) over restrictions that include mandatory face coverings, social distancing and other precautions. 

 But those in positions of authority within the state are refusing to address the importance of the many people who had and recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies. Antibodies [are produced naturally](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy/monoclonal-antibodies) by your body and help the immune system recognize germs that cause disease, such as bacteria and viruses, and mark them for destruction.

My question is does anyone understand why the same protection is not being offered to family members insured under the same plan.  It seems all of our data would be at risk.

I called IDX and they said the offer does not apply to anyone but him.  I called Health Net and they said to enroll everyone with the same enrollment code, but that led to an error message that the code had already been redeemed.

Velcro +cloth for back shade (homemade, under 20)

Solar charger (50 or more)

Battery bank (70) 


Park towards 68 block, cops will harass you less.  If they wake you up just tell them a sob story.  Theres one asshole on famino majorica that will call them on vehicle dwellers.  He's also sprayed down a friend of mine with a hose for brushing his teeth on the street.  Just be warned.

(I made this really quickly late last night, so please forgive any mistakes I may have made and the fact that it's probably very incomplete! The point is that there are lots of huge in-person classes planned for this fall.)

Does anyone else think this is super reckless given the possibility of breakthrough infections and the rise of the delta variant? It just seems completely unnecessary to pack students like sardines in these large lecture halls, especially when other UC’s are being way more cautious. For example, [this article](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Back-on-campus-with-new-rules-Bay-Area-colleges-16409700.php) states that UC Berkeley is holding classes with more than 200 people online. My sister goes to UCLA and her [large lecture classes are online](https://covid-19.ucla.edu/ucla-return-to-campus/) with in person labs and sections. Why aren’t we doing that?

My second concern is that UCSB admin’s planning and communication has been really bad throughout the course of the entire pandemic. Despite being only three weeks away from the start of classes, the most recent email we got from Chancellor Yang barely has any specifics on UCSB’s COVID protocols (besides stating that vaccines and masks will be mandated). There are a bunch of questions that I feel still haven’t been answered:

1. What happens if a student gets sick and needs to isolate? Current CDC guidelines state that you should isolate for [10 days](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fif-you-are-sick%2Fquarantine.html) minimum if you know you have COVID. How are students supposed to make up 10 days worth of work and stay on track?
2. Will our classrooms have air cleaners and HVAC filters to reduce the risk of COVID lingering in the air? If not, can the university at least mandate open windows for ventilation?
3. Will the university provide accommodations for disabled, high-risk students whose lives would be endangered by in person instruction during a pandemic? Can high-risk students request a remote option as a disability accommodation?
4. What is UCSB’s plan for if a large outbreak occurs? How many people need to get sick for us to go back online?

We deserve to know the answers to these questions. I’m so frustrated by the lack of communication on the part of UCSB admin. Like, I’m really trying to stay positive about this whole situation, but realistically I don’t see how this is going to work out if we are going to have huge in-person classes and really poor planning and communication. Is anyone else feeling this way?"

I know these tips may seem like common sense to some, but I just wanted to give a few tips that I would like to share:

1. Make Connections and Network!

I feel like the humanities doesn't express enough how important connections and networking are for someone during and after their time in undergrad. I can't stress this enough! Talk to your professors and your TAs, go to office hours, and express interest! My connection to someone in my department allowed to me to get a well-paid, long-term/ongoing research assistantship that has opened many doors for me. I am also in the process of applying to a lot of things, including grad school, and I have had no problem securing great LORs. ALSO don't wait too late! It's not something you only have to worry about as a 3rd and 4th year! Also, your professors and TAs are often interesting and cool people in general, so get to know them!

2.  Make sure you are receiving emails from your department's undergrad advisor. 

This may not be applicable to every department, but at least in the German and English department our advisors are constantly sending emails about internships, jobs, research opportunities, and other cool programs offered by the department. SO make sure you are checking your emails! Handshake is also a great resource, so make sure you are always improving your resume and application skills. It doesn't hurt to apply!

3. Be involved in your department!

If your department has a club or other resources that you may be interested in, go to them! You never know who you might meet or connect with.

Of course my experience isn't everyone's experience, but I truly believe that your major is what you make of it! If you are interested in the German or English program or need any advice, DM me!"

so I am an incoming freshman and I am moving in on Saturday. I initially had my covid test scheduled for me but it was a lil early so i tried cancelling and getting anew one. I guess I read the date wrong and scheduled it for Sunday. So now I am left with a Sunday appointment. What are the chances they let me have my reservation “back” or just let me test that day?

I am a 27 year old guy from philly who's been in Santa Barbara for 7 months now.

I like this city, but feel like it's not very financially feasible for those fresh in their career.

I feel lucky to have the job I do, but also think that having a ""good"" job is no longer good enough to live here comfortably. I may move back East.

Here are some more thoughts:

* The area is mostly comprised of students (undergrad, grad, phd) who live on their parents dime OR those already in the latter half of their career (or retirement)
* Unless you work in tech software or Gov't, I don't think there are many opportunities here for recent graduates to make decent salaries over the 70k range.
* I do not understand how those in the restaurant/ service industry can live here comfortably.

If you feel so inclined, I would love to hear in the comments your:

* Age
* Line of work
* Pay &amp; career growth you've had here in Santa Barbara
* Any other thoughts you may have

I'll start...

I know money is tight but so is time. About a year ago I decided to change my life using a fluff and fold service. In my case at least, actually makes a lot of economic sense to use the fluff and fold services rather than washing my own clothes. 

Here are the reasons I think you should consider using the service too. There are places around town that offer student discounts, pick up and drop off. 

1. Your time is much more valuable than what the market is willing to pay you for it. The information you’re collecting now, the connections you’re making, and the skills you’re building will have exponential value and folding clothes will not. 

If you could spend an extra 2 or 3 hours a week just thinking about your favorite classes materials, in your chosen environment without any obligations, how much money would that be worth to you? 

2. Folding clothes is really important for success. You can’t go to class in dirty clothes and feel 100%. At the same time, it’s challenging to keep a schedule because laundry in IV can be dependent on so many factors outside of your control. Quarters, people not rotating their loads, availability, etc.

3. It declutters one thing from your brain and that is really priceless. 

I’ve seen places willing to do pickups in iv for free and the laundry is around $1.15/lb -$1.75/lb."

qkmp5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/qkmp5h/i_was_a_university_of_michigan_student_who_lived/,I was a University of Michigan student who lived in UM's windowless Munger Graduate Residence. It is exactly as bad as people say it is.,97,61,2021-11-01 13:15:14,"A friend who knows about my horrible experience pointed me to an article about Munger trying to build another windowless dorm at UCSB.

Don't live there. Ever. Here are my thoughts after living in UM's Munger building in Ann Arbor for a few years:

1) The ""close spaces"" forming bonding experiences is mostly BS. It was basically a blind-roommate situation where people mostly kept to themselves. People end up getting mad at each other for the normal stuff - not cleaning, leaving a mess, making too much noise, etc. It doesn't make you bond any more than a regular dorm experience.

2) HOLY FUCKING SHIT THE WINDOWS. I thought it didn't matter to me as someone who has a weird sleep schedule anyways. I thought it didn't matter to me as someone who was frequently nocturnal. I thought it didn't matter to me as someone who enjoyed being alone anyways. I was so so so wrong. Going to bed and waking up in complete darkness everyday fucked with me so hard. After months of this I got to the point where I was snoozing for _3 hours_ and completely lacked the ability to get out of bed on some days. I didn't know when to get up or when to go to sleep and the days just started blurring together. I bought a sunrise alarm clock (one of those clocks that gradually brightens to simulate a sunrise). It didn't help. I made my alarms noisier and switched up the tones. It didn't help.

3) They will try to win you over with nice furnishings and appliances and attractive ""living community"" spaces at an attractive price point. Don't be fooled. They are all very nice but if you are stuck in your bed, it won't matter. Also, the university jacked up rent far faster than inflation each year. I think inflation was around 2%/year when I was there but rates were going up 4-6% per year.

The architecture plan for The UCSB building looks even _worse_ than Michigan's. At UM, at least each ""suite"" of 6-7 rooms has a common area that has windows in it, so you can sit there to at least catch some daylight. The UCSB version looks like almost NONE of the suites _or_ rooms have access to windows.

[This article](https://www.independent.com/2021/10/28/architect-resigns-in-protest-over-ucsb-mega-dorm/) states that

&gt; “as the ‘vision’ of a single donor, the building is a social and psychological experiment with an unknown impact on the lives and personal development of the undergraduates the university serves.”

But it has definitely been tested. It is just as horrible as you'd imagine. When I finally moved to an objectively crappier apartment, except with windows, my life immensely improved."

From time to time, I've seen various students (edit: and others) post about their experiences with Gauchospace*, and compare those experiences with other similar systems, especially Canvas, which some students have used either at Community College or in High School.

(*Note: Gauchospace is just the UCSB branding for a software package known as Moodle.)

Knowing that anecdotes aren't data, and that a Reddit thread isn't necessarily a scientific survey, I'm still interested to know your thoughts.

https://www.coastal.ca.gov/

It may be useful to familiarize yourself with who they are, what powers they have, and what their concerns are, and how you can have input into their deliberations.

Simply put: if the Coastal Commission throws roadblocks in the way, this thing doesn't happen.

Their concerns are likely not the same as the ones being expressed by students.

But if there are aspects of the plan that would cause the Coastal Commission to find fault with it, or delay it, or require ""modifications"" (Mr. Munger *hates* those), well then, there you go."

The TPS website seems to suggest that you will get a ticket if you are parked in a charging spot without actively charging. On the other hand, the trickle charging spots are designated as electric ""preferred"", so gas cars could park there without getting a ticket if the rest of the spots were full. 

&amp;#x200B;

What happens if you plug in an electric car at a trickle charging spot, go to work on campus for 5 hours, but charging finishes after 3 hours. Would you get a ticket during the two hours of not actively charging? This is assuming you have an EV permit and a B permit"

I didn't buy a parking pass because its cheaper for me to just pay the meter for the 2 days im on campus. But are there really people who will go around and give me a ticket on my car if I don't pay the meter? All the times I would walk to my car I never saw anyone going around and checking the receipts. There was a couple times where I forgot to go to the meter and nothing happened so how does that work? Should I just live on the edge and never pay?
