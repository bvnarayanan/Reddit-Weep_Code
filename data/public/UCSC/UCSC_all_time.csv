62upt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/62upt8/engineering_majors_so_you_can_communicate_with/,"Engineering majors, so you can communicate with the new frosh: introducing proposed major gating",28,10,2017-04-01 12:01:03,"For people entering in the Fall and on out, in order to declare an engineering major (with a few exceptions), you have to be a proposed engineering major, and you can be removed from your proposed major at the end of your first year if you don't make progress towards your degree.  You can be a proposed CS major and declare for CE, or the other way around, but if you have been removed from your proposed major, you will not be able to declare an engineering major (except for those previously mentioned exceptions).


In your first year, you have to take three classes towards your major, and they have to include passing your first quarter of calculus (which you can do by taking math19a, math 20a, or placing out of those) plus two more classes from: CHEM 1A, CMPE 12, CMPE 13, CMPE 16, CMPS 11, CMPS 12A, CMPS 12B, MATH 19B, MATH 20B, PHYS 5A, OR PHYS 5C.  

If you don't do that, you will be removed from your proposed engineering major and you won't be able to major in any engineering major.  This is to catch people early who are having trouble--it's a very loose check--most people take more than three of those. 

Why did we do this?  Because people who don't take three pertinent classes in their first year almost always fail to graduate in engineering, and most of them fail to graduate at all.  This check is to encourage people to go and investigate other majors before it is too late. We studied everyone who showed up between 2012 and 2014 and took any engineering classes.  We looked at what major they selected and if they were able to declare by campus deadlines.  For the 2012 cohort we looked at graduation.  Basically, getting right on your math is make or break for engineering majors.

Part of this means that once you get here, the only way to switch majors into an engineering major is to go to the engineering office so they can make sure, if you are past your first year, you have taken the classes.  So you won't be able to change your major to engineering at your college anymore.

None of this holds for most of you reading this.  It is for entering frosh of 17/18."

68qys4,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/68qys4/to_todays_may_day_protesters/,To today's May Day protesters:,127,129,2017-05-01 21:05:11,"Let me summarize what was accomplished today:

* Basically all food services for students on campus were suspended, and those that were open were [severely understaffed][1]. With campus food (that students paid for!) not an option, many turned to delivery - to find that nobody would deliver to campus, because the roads are blocked. With dining and catering closed, the closest food source to campus is a chain that has a [spotted history][0] with the people you claim to support.

* University business ground to a halt. You set back research on [treating childhood cancer][2], [West Nile virus epidemics][3], and [poverty alleviation][4] by a day.

* You surrounded and unnecessarily provoked police offers (who you then compared to the KKK) after they calmly and diplomatically approached the tent when one of you tried to chase and fight someone who had slipped through the line. You were also just outright [rude][7] to people. (But it's ""peaceful"" protesting, so it's okay.)

* Forced students who actually *care* about school, who *paid* to get an education, and *want* to do well academically to miss class because their professors and TAs couldn't make it to campus. Which maybe wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't literally the middle of midterm season.

* You caused a great deal of mental anguish to [those][6] with anxiety who were impacted by the above.

* You caused undue stress on local medical facilities by not only turning away student health center staff, but by turning away those who needed to go to the health center, then asking them to [call 911 or ""hit up the ER in town""][5], because for some reason the health center on campus wasn't good enough.

There are countless stories of students whose housing plans for next year were threatened because they couldn't catch a bus to see their landlord, who were isolated with nowhere to eat, who needed medical care and were turned away by protesters. Most of these people still have no idea what you were ""standing in solidarity"" for. None of them actually had any capacity to do anything.

If you think university administrators were responsible for this, you just gave them a paid day off, wasting university money and by extension making it harder for people who are disadvantaged - for the undocumented, for the immigrants, for the people of color you say you support - to gain an education, succeed in life, and overcome the forces that undermine them. If you participated in this protest and turn around and start protesting tuition hikes, classes being too crowded, protesting lack of funding for campus research units who actually need it, then you're a hypocrite. If your goal is to [""make the school lose money""][8], then you shouldn't even be here.

That's not even the worst part. The worst part is that I actually support the underlying cause. I support the rights of undocumented and immigrant workers. My parents are immigrants themselves. And thanks to you, my legitimate attempt to stand in solidarity with those workers is undermined because now whenever I do so, I have to explain why I'm associating myself with people such as yourselves who are making unbelievably stupid decisions.

Thank you. Thank you for accomplishing literally nothing. Thank you so much.

---

Post-reaction edit: I was really angry when I wrote this, and this comes across as much harsher than I would've liked. I support the underlying ideas, I really do. I'm just disappointed that students at a university would act in ways that are so obviously contradictory to the values they espouse.

69d7oi,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/69d7oi/why_blumenthal_made_the_wrong_choice_in_regards/,Why Blumenthal made the wrong choice in regards to A/BSA,63,52,2017-05-05 00:08:14,"To start off, let me say that I don't have any experience firsthand with the ""struggles"" of black students. I identify as Latino and have not personally experienced even the slightest oppression at UCSC based on race. For all I know the situation could be completely different for black students.

That aside, I believe that Blumenthal made the wrong choice in regards to bending to the demands of the A/BSA upon them commandeering Kerr Hall. Many of us remember how during winter quarter, the A/BSA made these same demands of the administration while taking no immediate direct action (that I'm aware of). We can only assume that the demands were either ignored or denied.

Assuming they were ignored, Blumenthal made the wrong choice by demonstrating that the only way for a student group to get attention from the administration is to disrupt college activities to the point where the administration has no choice but to address the disruptive students directly.

Assuming they were denied, Blumenthal just demonstrated that any student group, no matter how ridiculous the demands they may make, can get their demands considered by throwing a tantrum if the administration says no, even for good reason.

Furthermore, this agreement that they have come to further proliferates the culture of special treatment based on race or identity. Why do black students in particular get these special accommodations? While we're at it, we might as well offer the same special accommodations to Asian American students, Latino students, and Native American students. Heck, while were at it, we may as well give these accommodations to each individual tribe of Native American students. The Pomo tribe had to survive the [Bloody Island massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Island_massacre) so why not give them a dedicated house on campus? The point here is that among minority students, I see no real need to protect black students in particular over any specific minority group. If anyone knows why, please let me know.

This agreement also represents a disturbing trend in the UCSC community where student groups seem to be under the idea that being as disruptive as possible to campus life is the easiest way to get the spotlight rather than attempting to use diplomacy or pre-existing pathways to get what they want. This is very bad for UCSC's image as it demonstrates a weakness of the administration for disruptive students at the cost of academic performance and life as usual on campus. Practical activism is a good thing, but when a group of students go out and make the news by being disruptive of the learning that is supposed to be happening on campus, that undermines our image as a world respected institution.

To conclude, I believe that if Blumenthal was going to agree to any of the demands of the A/BSA, he should have done it when they requested it the first time, and not wait until they decide to commandeer a building in order to get what they want. I'm not convinced the A/BSA had completely thought through and exhausted all their options when it came to getting what they want, but not being a member of that club, I will withhold judgement. I think the fault rests with Blumenthal for his behavior in response to the activism. When it came time to have a diplomatic discussion with a student activism group, he bailed. When it came time to make a demonstration that the administration will not tolerate student groups disrupting the academic climate on campus, he caved."

What exactly about UCSC is anti-black? I for one have never been to a place as liberal, friendly, and accepting at UCSC. Ive heard some saying that there are white supremacy posters on campus and even if that is true, there is NO way that is the norm because that's not what type of student body we have here. Isolated incidents of racism are not necessarily indicative of a racist institution.

Furthermore, I have read the list of demands and from my perspective most are just asking for special privileges. All students are affected by the housing crisis, EOP already provides 4 year guarantees to disadvantaged students so why do you need one for black people only? Plenty of people lost their lounge spaces. If you don't feel a sense of belonging on one of the most liberal, activism based, and accepting campuses in the country, maybe it's you who has the problem?

I won't argue with painting the house and the advisor I think those are fine points.

If you think I'm full of shit, please respectfully explain why. To me most of this seems like complaining about nothing and asking for special treatment because I have never seen any instance or heard anyone give an actual explanation as to how blacks are discriminated against at UCSC."

Protests should not be designed to shutdown the school or interrupt classes. Protests should be working with the students, not against us.


   *Update:* Hello everyone. I love the discussions going on here and the spread of opinions. Here is what I've found:


Individual issues aside, the vast majority of people on campus and in the world are observers.  Observers see protesters yelling and shouting rally words such as ""**fighting**"" and ""**winning**"".  An observer sees protesters launching a ""**war**"" and their natural instinct is to turn defensive.  Rightfully so.  Hundreds of people chanting in your place of work/study, your impulsive reaction will not be positive.  These are buzz words and create more controversy than they are worth.  

*An easy idea:*  We receive emails from the campus about the complications and the setbacks created by protests but nothing about the protest itself.  **How can we unify the school?**  How about asking protest leaders to work in collaboration with the UC so that we can receive informative mails **24hrs prior to the event** regarding what the demonstration is about.  A professional an non bias informative email could do a lot of good for everyone.  

What do you think?

Yes, that is a very sad movie.  Perhaps watching it the night before your final was not helpful for you.  How is it again I should adjust my grading rubric to accommodate for this self-inflicted grief?

Yes it is sad that you have unmet learning accommodations, but the time to address that was before the final and not after.

No, I don't suddenly have extra-credit assignments you can do after the end of the quarter.

Yes, being deported/imprisoned/disowned/depressed/discouraged/constipated sounds very bad. Why, again, am I just hearing about these crushing pressures of yours after you failed to do most of the work for the quarter?

I'm sorry to hear about your grandmother. (Why is it always grandmothers.  Gerald Moulds, who teachings in Computer Engineering, keeps a chart of dead grandmothers and grandfathers in his office and at what point in the quarter they tend to kick the bucket.  In, if I recall, 10 years of records, there has been only one dead grandfather, but the surge of dead grandmothers as the final project is due is quite striking.)

That answer is perfect, but not to the question you were given.  It is, interestingly enough, the right answer for your neighbors exam.

You were told that touching your cell phone during the exam would result in a 0 on the exam. No, I can't read that alphabet, and I don't care. How interesting: my TA can. What, you accidentally deleted your texts?  How sad.

Yes, traffic can be awful. Traffic totally stopped, you say?  ? Hey, here is another person who traveled along that route and arrived in time for the final.  Lying, is she? How dastardly.

Your alarm didn't go off? Your calendar told you the exam was tomorrow?  I should have reminded you? The fact that I mentioned the date and time of the final at the start of every lecture just caused you to edit that information out of your existence? Your employer is going to love you.

Your conversation with your exam neighbor in that language I don't speak was just about borrowing a tissue? How many tissues did you say you needed to borrow, again? And how did you dispose of them, again?

You have an assigned seat for the final, and you were not in your row?  The person who you say was on your left does not have you listed as being on her right? She lists a completely different person who coincidentally also lists her as being on his left. You must be very slim.

You would have had a better grade if you weren't so incapable of doing anything that means anything? Once we get that brain scanner that checks for understanding without your having to submit any work, your life will be easier, I'm sure.

You didn't come to class all quarter because you are smarter than everyone else in class and it depresses you to be around mediocrity? Self-teaching is much more effective for you?  And...this explains your score on the final, how?

6eyfl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/6eyfl5/a_message_to_everyone_concerned_about_fall/,A message to everyone concerned about Fall enrollment,40,1,2017-06-02 18:01:50,"I wanted to make this after seeing a number of people posting about not getting into their classes. 

Fall quarter is nearly four months away and that is a long time to be unsure about your classes. However, a lot of things can change in four months. If you are on a wait list (and not up somewhere like the 50s) just be patient. There are other people in the same position as you, currently enrolled in those classes, waiting for the class they need to open up and using your class as a safety. There are also people who will realize they don't actually need that class next quarter, or at all, and will drop it, or people that fail a prereq this quarter and can no longer take it. Additionally, some classes have less spots than are actually in the class. This is so that incoming freshmen and transfers have a chance to get into those classes. Near the end of the summer, they will expand the class and you will be able to sign up during open enrollment. 

This happens every spring; there are transfers who need spots, freshmen who need spots,  current students that need spots, and the administration almost always opens more spots during the summer for the high demand classes. If you add yourself to the wait list, it shows them that there is more demand, and will help them allocate resources to try to fit everyone's needs. 

Now, if for some reason you didn't get into a class that you ABSOLUTELY need and do not see a chance of enough spaces opening, you have a few options:

1) Email the professor for the class and explain your concerns. Every class gets permission codes near the start of the quarter, and in my experience, professors are usually very sympathetic in make or break situations. Speak to them and let them know early. I personally need two classes during fall that I'm taking the prereq for over summer. I spoke to the professors and they took note of my situation and said they would try to get me in when fall gets closer. 

2) Look over your planner again and see if you can fit that class in some other time. Unless you are going to graduate next year, there are almost always alternative schedules that will allow you to graduate on time. Some classes are prereqs to many major core classes, see if you can satisfy other classes (electives, GEs) instead, if you can't get the prereq done. If you are unsure, speak to an advisor. 

3) If you ARE going to graduate next year, and the class you need is only offered once a year, or would conflict with other classes if you moved it, see (1) and talk to an advisor. 

4) If this class would somehow impact you declaring on time, look at your department website and see if they would allow you to declare late. I believe SOE now requires you to declare in something else if you can't make the requirements by your 6th quarter, but you can still change back once you get certain classes completed. Again, see an advisor. 

5) If you are in a situation other than what I have mentioned so far, start talking to people that can help. Posting on reddit can get you some advice, but it will not improve your chances of getting into a full class. Advisors are paid to prevent and get you out of these situations. Speak to them, speak to the professor, speak to anyone that might be able to help you. The sooner you go on record about needing a class, the better your chances are of getting it. Here are links to all the major advising departments: https://advising.ucsc.edu/about/major-advising/major-links.html. Your question or problem might already be addressed.

Even if getting this class isn't entirely necessary, you can still try for a permission code, but it is often easier and less stressful to go on a wait list, wait until later in the summer to see if more spots open, or modify your schedule. Also, permission codes do not come out until closer to the start of the quarter. Don't harass the professor about not getting it now, because they probably don't even have any yet.

As a note: I am not trying to discourage anyone from asking questions on here, but you will likely get better help if you speak to an advisor as well. They know what you've taken, what you need, what the department allows, and have seen many other students in the same situation and can help you make a plan that will work. 

Also, plenty of people drop classes at the beginning of the quarter, you still have a chance even if the quarter has already started.

If I have said anything that was incorrect or you have a better alternative or knowledge, let me know. 

Be patient and use your resources. Goodluck everyone.

Freshman year I entered as a Business Management and Economics major(Switched to Econ/Envs). While at orientation when they have you take your classes, I asked her what math classes I should be taking. I knew there was an Econ 11A/B and Math11A/B. I asked her if the Math11A/B would suffice and she told me yes - the classes were 'interchangeable with no extra classes needed', great. I took calc in high school and would rather take something I know I would do better in so I stuck with Math11A/B. Come to taking upper divisons... I now don't have the math requirement.

So I went and talked to Econ advising and they basically said ""Oh sorry, we know someone from that college has been giving students the wrong advice for the math classes and you aren't the first person to tell us about this. However, you still have to take the math requirement."" I begrudgingly signed up for a transferable math class this summer - which has turned out to be no less than a literal shit show.

Its gotten to the point that because the class is online, I had to hire a proctor. I hired an old high school teacher - which was approved by my math professor - to be mailed my exam (which is due on June 30th) to my proctors school. Well, turns out my high school doesn't get mail during the summer and I had to go out of my way to get my high school admin to retrieve my test from the post office. ONLY to be told that my test has not arrived yet, and my test date was supposed to be today! On top of all of this, my current professor thinks I'm lying about everything and has promised to fail me if I don't turn in my midterm.

As I work full time, this has been nothing short of extremely frustrating for me. I passed Math11A/B with a B+/B- so its not like I don't understand the concepts. The only reason I've had to deal with all of this is because an advisor told me the wrong class. I don't know what to do from this point on because I feel its unfair that they won't accept the classes I were told to take. Without them, I can't start or take any upper divisions.

Sorry for the long post, but can anyone give me directions?

TL;DR Advisor told me to take the wrong math class, took said math classes and passed, tried to sign up for classes and didn't have prereqs. Tried taking a class to make up for my advisors mistake and basically got shat on by distance learning not sending my midterm in time and professor doesn't believe me and is now threatening to fail me. 1)What steps do I take to hold my advisor accountable and 2) What should I do if I do fail this class?"

If you're anything like me freshman year, you're excited and scared all the same to begin your new start at UCSC. 

Here are some things that you should know about UCSC and starting here as a transfer or as a freshman.

ON SOCIAL LIFE:
Everyone here is at least semi-friendly. When you start in the dorms, relax. Everyone is in the same position as you, or at least nearly everyone. No one knows anyone, and they're all looking to make friends. It's ok to be a little scared, shy, and awkward. 

Go to the RA events hosted the first week. It'll be the perfect opportunity to meet people from your college. Again, just be friendly,

If partying isn't your crowd, that's ok! I believe that most groups I've met at UCSC don't really peer pressure and if you don't feel comfortable doing something, then don't. You will find another group that enjoys other things besides partying. Explore campus clubs and groups and even Greek life if that's what suites you.

ON CLASSES AND TIME MANAGEMENT:
I've learned the hard way that your college advisor might not necessarily know your major the best. It's easy to pick classes the first quarter because you have so many GEs and the college classes to fulfill, but take what they say with a grain of salt. Always always always double check with your major advisor who should be able to contact you via email over the summer if you're concerned about what classes to take. They are almost always friendly and happy to help. 

As far as time management goes, keep in mind you'll have free reign over what you do. Your parents won't be there, your professor won't  be there, your classmates might not even be there. Only you know how much you need to study for a given class and stick to it. Keep in mind short study sessions are almost always better than long study sessions before exams. Even just reading a chapter a day, a few problems, or going over your notes will keep you refreshed with information.

ON GETTING LOST:
If you've never been on campus, you'll quickly realize how hard it might be to navigate campus. The best advice I can give to you is to spend a day or two with some friends learning campus, make a scavenger hunt of everyone's classrooms or even just look up online the main lecture halls. Find them. You'll be infinitely more cool if you know how to navigate UCSC right off the bat at the beginning of the year. Almost everyone gets lost.

That being said, if you do get lost, ask for help! Everyone has been in your position and my experience is that everyone is more than happy to help you out. 

ON PICKING YOUR COLLEGE: 
I understand there are themes to each college, and you might have spent a lot of time picking one in particular. However, the fact is, no matter what college you pick you will be fine. You will find a  group of friends there and you will grow to hopefully enjoy it. 

ON DINING HALLS:
The dining halls really aren't that bad. They tend to get a little boring, but as long as you know how to make a decent sandwich or salad you'll get along just fine. Keep in mind you'll be the one to decide what you eat, so don't always go for the fried foods. Get some fruit and veggies with each meal.

Just this one class feels like a full course load and I'm already feeling burned out. I am unable to focus on other activities such as working out, reading, and generally relaxing before I have to go back for summer session 2.

There has been a ton of academic dishonestly this past quarter/year and I find it very hypocritical of students to be complaining about the lack of ABET accreditation and how it lowers the standards of the program when there is so much rampant academic dishonesty. The latter does far more damage to a program and society than the former. If you want to help make the SOE programs better encourage your fellow peers to stop cheating and to report those that do. 

Academic dishonesty is far more embarrassing than losing a seal of approval by some accreditation outfit that is behind the times.

Don't feel shitty if you haven't found your group of friends within the first couple weeks of college in your dorm. People usually tend to form into groups almost immediately from move in day because everyone's trying to make friends/doesn't wanna feel left our of the group. By like Week 3 or what-not it might feel like these groups are permanent; most of the time they aren't. 


Just coming from someone who took till Winter Quarter to really find her group of people, don't feel bad if you haven't found a solid group of friends till later in the year. Often times these early groups end up breaking apart because of differing interests or their true personailities start coming out after the initial hype of Welcome week and the start of the year. 


Your gonna make a lot of friends in college throughout all four years. Inside your rez hall and outside. You're gonna meet people in class, clubs, and what not so long as you put yourself out there and aren't an asshole. 


Better yet, make friends with people in your intended major! These guys are going down the same path as you, and when your all stressed out over studying for finals it's pretty comforting knowing you have people going through the same struggles with you.


Just wanted to give you guys some advice I wish I had known coming in as a freshman 3 years ago!

6ykzfw,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/6ykzfw/what_to_do_in_santa_cruz_from_a_local_student/,WHAT TO DO IN SANTA CRUZ! (From a local student),100,26,2017-09-06 21:25:22,"Hi! I'm a UCSC student and I've lived in Santa Cruz my entire life. The goal of this post is to serve as a resource for people coming from other places that want to get accustomed to Santa Cruz life. I sort of wrote this because I'm bored but I'll update it if anyone wants me to.

#Night Life
The UCSC way is studying all day and partying all night. Santa Cruz has a surprisingly active night life, especially compared to other larger cities that I've visited recently. You'll find a lot of people walking around through suburbs at night, and people here are fairly tolerant of moderate noise, even late into the night. There aren't many stores that are open very late other than the downtown strip and mission street. Other popular hangout spots are West Cliff, public parks, and like most of the west side. The only places that I'd advise staying away from at night are the Levi and the Beach Flats areas, because that's where there's a lot of homeless/gang activity.

#Drugs
I don't know if I'm allowed to talk about this on this sub, but basically marijuana is the de-facto drug of Santa Cruz. You will never be arrested for just smoking pot, and it's totally okay to smoke in most public areas (but stay away from where there are kids, etc.). Smoking on campus is a big no-no, but there is a lot of forest area that people often use for that, and people are rarely chastised unless they're doing something else really stupid as well.

#Law Enforcement
Our cops are literally the most chill police officers that you'll ever come across. They really do care most about keeping citizens safe, and they are very unlikely to write tickets on a technicality. If you're driving safely, you won't get speeding tickets, if you're on a bike, they won't cite you for running stop signs, and like I said earlier, if you're smoking weed in public, they won't really care. That being said, don't be an idiot. The police are there to do their job. Thebub77 and pinkerlisa brought up that skating on campus and biking on the sidewalk downtown can get you cited. In general, be careful around the Pacific Avenue area, that's one of the few parts of town where the police are pretty strict.

#The Boardwalk
If you're thinking about going to the boardwalk often, you should know that it's pretty easy to get in for free. The boardwalk employs almost entirely students, and all boardwalk employees get unlimited passes for themselves and quite a few to share with their friends. If you have any friends that are employees and look remotely similar to you, you could even just borrow their employee pass to get in, and nobody will question you. 

#Beaches
Main Beach (the one right in front of the boardwalk) is the most busy and the most heavily enforced. There are small coves, dog beaches, and nudist beaches all up and down the coast. If you're looking for a place to make a fire, beaches like Twin Lakes have fire pits, but those can get pretty busy and it isn't a lot of fun to have a bonfire 30 feet away from another group that's also having a bonfire. Often, people will just dig small firepits in the sand of the smaller beaches and have fires there. If you want to have a big beach party, check out some of the beaches along Highway 1 north, as they're less populated and not very heavily patrolled. And remember to pack your trash


#Where to go if...
* You want to make noise

There is an industrial area at the bottom of Western Drive that not many people inhabit. It's great to walk around at night there with a group, and that area or the end of Delaware st. is where a lot of people go to drift their cars. 

* You want to buy weed

West cliff. Literally walk up to any parked car, there's like a 50/50 chance they're selling it.

* you're hungry and it's 2 in the morning

the Westside Safeway complex has a few stores that are open 24/7, like Farrell's Donuts, that get a lot of college traffic late at night. There's also a bus that goes there.

* You want to drive

If you want a fun drive, I recommend the Bonny Doon area, or Highway 17, which goes between Santa Cruz and San Jose/San Francisco. If you just wanna go fast, try Highway 1 North, but be careful because it's not well lit at night.

* You want to buy stuff

If you can get over to the East side of town, there's the Capitola Mall.

* You want to go on a date but you don't have money

West cliff/the downtown strip are both great places for going out. If you want more privacy, try some of the Santa Cruz hiking trails, like pogonip. There is also the Long Marine Lab, which is a pretty cool ocean museum thing (thanks to /u/danatronic for mentioning it)

* you want to go on a date but you do have money

Capitola village is a nice little area that doesn't get a whole lot of college traffic, and has a few small shops and nice restaurants.. but it's a bit touristy."

2. If you are going from one part of the campus to another please please please take a loop or walk. Don’t clog up metro and make people who live off campus wait.

72vxwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/72vxwv/to_freshmen_its_okay_if_youre_feeling_alone/,(To freshmen) It's okay if you're feeling alone.,66,7,2017-09-27 15:43:30,"It's normal. I've been there. Your friends (and to-be friends) have been there. Your professors have been there. Your RA has been there. We all understand.

That first day/week is pretty scary. You're alone, not sure who to hang out with at first. Those people you sat with at dinner right after move-in and goodbyes to mom and dad, might not be your friends for the rest of your time here. It's a time full of uncertainty and doubt, and I don't blame you. You're in a totally new place, new environment, feel out of place. It's normal. It sucks, yes. But it's normal.

That being said, I can give you a couple of tips to get to know people. Because now is the time.

1. Keep your dorm door open so people can talk to you: This make a pretty big difference, it keeps a welcoming atmosphere for you and for everyone else.

2. GO TO SECTION: On a point completely separate from academics, but go to section. You'll make some friends, or at least people you see on a semi-regular basis. Who knows, you might meet your next best friend, or your future SO there.

3. Invite your floormates to eat at the dining hall: Seems simple, right? But this makes a big difference too.

4. Ask people on other floors if they want to join: You never know. Now's a pretty good time

5. Keep on doing this for the quarter: Seems a little try-hardy, I know. But the repetition leads to opportunities, and opportunities leads to more friends.

6. Not everyone will be your friend: And that's okay.

You've got this. (At least, if you're in the 89.8% of freshmen who are still here by the beginning of next fall quarter) Take a deep breath. Now take another one. [And another one.](https://youtu.be/jEI3N9kIyP4?t=7s) Now good luck, because all you have to do is knock on some doors, and ask.

On a complete side note, call mom and dad. They're worried sick about you already, and would love to hear from you. Because one day they'll be gone, and you'll wish you could speak to them one more time."

[Here is a preview](https://i.imgur.com/waLkx3K.jpg) of how it looks. I'm really excited about this because one of the biggest problems I personally had was opening the app and having to stare at the busses to figure out which direction they were going, which was quite annoying if I was walking to class. This totally removes that annoyance, improving the overall usability by a lot.

CS is being very strict about this.  Don't depend on declaring late.  You should know that your desire and commitment to CS isn't an argument for declaring at seven, eight, nine, or ten quarters. 

I know you don't want to hear it, but if the advisors fail to encourage you with such a plan, they are not out to get you: they are trying to keep you from wasting your time. 

There are adequate reasons to declare after your sixth quarter (but not after your seventh or greater), but they are situationally dependent, not always granted, and require speaking to an advisor.  *It would really be best if you didn't depend on this*.

Some majors in SOE have late declaration procedures, but all of them require that you have previously declared some other major, and none of those majors with a late declaration procedure is CS.

Edit 1: clarity for paragraph 3.

Edit 2: This holds for picking up a second major as well as your primary major"

I know that the bus system here really isn't the best, but for the students that are trying to get home at the end of the day getting on a bus can take much longer than needed. If you take a city bus to get from Stevenson to Porter for example, you're taking up a space for someone that needs to get home off campus.

If you are capable, walk to your classes to save up space and get to know the campus better.

Also, don't forget you don't have to show your student ID to loop buses! Only the city buses.

She yelled, called them racists, and otherwise insulted a group of people with views different from hers. I do not agree with the Republican agenda, but freedom of speech is integral to this country as a whole. If one group does not have the ability to speak freely, no one does. The First Amendment is integral to our country, our state, and our campus. Sabina did not respect that right. As such, she deserves to be censured by the Student Union Assembly. The SUA is currently considering a motion to censure Sabina. It will be voted on at the next SUA meeting. We must not allow the suppression of minority voices. If you agree, please show your support for the censure by showing up for the SUA’s meeting today at 8pm in the Cervantes Velasquez Conference Room. Thank you.

- It takes forever to get scores for our labs. We just got our first 3 lab after the drop deadline. The first lab was to push a file to GitLab, which they had an automated grader for!!
- I understand Dunne is busy and has a lot of students to handle (~550), but he has TAs who say they didn't even get the materials to grade our labs until very recently.
- He reuses the lecture content from previous quarters and the labs seem to be from previous quarters as well, so I can't see how a lot of time is being spent restructuring the course. The TAs get the labs the same time as us, so in the beginning of the week they have a hard time helping us. If the labs are the same as a previous quarter, could it be so difficult to release them earlier?
- Our midterm wasn't until after the drop deadline, and we didn't have any information to determine whether we should drop the class or not. He also cancelled his office hours before the drop deadline. 

I'm not complaining about the rigor of the class. It's actually quite manageable. However, I feel like Dunne needs to be held accountable. Dunne and Long always talk about the real world, meeting deadlines, etc. Dunne said he'd be posting our midterm grades by the middle of this week, and didn't, so he sounds a bit hypocritical. 

How can we hold Dunne accountable for this or help him do better? Am I out of line?

[This is my most recent picture of it](https://imgur.com/a/MtUvD)

This is a *very* unique bicycle. Note the Lefty fork; the front wheel is only connected to the frame on one side. I've yet to see another student riding a Lefty on campus. Also, the [bright red pedals](http://www.orcamart.com/products/wellgo/mg1/red/2.jpg) (albeit a little worn) are a dead giveaway that it's mine.

Also keep in mind this photo is not exactly up to date and a few things were different about the bike when it was stolen. I put new brakes on that are black instead of gray like in the picture as well as a different front brake rotor. The front tire was changed since the photo, it is now a Specialized Clutch 26x2.3. The rear tire is the same as shown, WTB Velociraptor 26x2.1. I also put on a mud fender beneath the seat that [looks like this.](http://road.cc/sites/default/files/cropped/preview_500/images/Mucky%20Nutz%20Road%20Butt%20Fender/Mucky%20Nutz%20Road%20Butt%20Fender%202.jpg) Oh yeah, I also took the bottle cage off.

Apologies for the long rant. I just really want my bike back. It's not worth very much money and it's honestly not in very good condition, but I've had it for like five years and it definitely has sentimental value. I'd greatly appreciate it if ya'll would PM me if you see it so I can get a clue where it is (I don't even know if it's on campus). If you take a picture of it that's even better. Best case scenario is a picture of the person who's riding it, but literally ANY info is super helpful to me. I know it probably won't turn up if the thief took it into the city but I think I have a decent chance if it's still on campus!

But going to OPERS can be scary, especially if you are new, and not familiar with gyms. First month will be hard and people will get annoyed at you thinking you are a new years resolution newbie. Prove them wrong!

Here's a few things you should keep in mind...

**""Everyone at the gym is stronger/leaner/in better shape than me!""**

If you're new to the gym, you *will* be worse off health-wise than everyone you see. This is a well documented effect ""The friendship paradox"" : 

https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/17/friends-you-can-count-on/

The simple fact is, if you are new to the gym, everybody else there has spent more time in the gym than you. Getting over this fear is one of the hardest things. 

And people will stare at you, you might feel uncomfortable, don't let anyone tell you that nobody judges in the gym, *everybody* judges. But that's something you have to conquer, and keep working. Remember you are there to improve yourself, and as you get in better shape, things will get better. 

**""But what about the machines ?""**

Navigating a gym if you don't know what you're doing, is hard, counterproductive and frankly dangerous to your health. You don't want to get hurt because of wrong form. Thankfully there's a lot of resources which you can use...

Watch Youtube videos, use the /r/fitness guides. Want to become bigger and stronger? /r/gainit. Want to get that summer bod /r/loseit!

Confused about equipment? 

Join in any of the ""Fitness Equipment Orientation"" listed here. 
https://apm.activecommunities.com/opers/Activity_Search 


It costs $3 and what you get is :
&gt;This is a 60-minute informational group-session with one of the UCSC FitLife program's certified personal fitness trainers in which the group will be given brief orientations and demonstrations for the purpose, proper-use, and body-specific settings of the strength-training and cardiovascular-training machines available for use in the OPERS Wellness Center.

Finally, most people at the gym will be happy (and frankly honored) to help you if you ask them for a ""form check"".

**""And the food?""**

Use calorie trackers, more details on /r/fitness wiki. Trust me, dining halls at UCSC are all you need. They always have a lot of variety of food, which is necessary to get fit. 

If you're not on a meal plan, you can buy slug club meals during the first two weeks at $8/meal. That's what I do, buy a bunch of meals at the beginning, and then try to make them last until the finals week $5 meal. It is not the tastiest stuff, but you can get a really healthy and balanced meal everyday. 

Check out https://dining.ucsc.edu for menu, nutritional details, meal plans, and timings. 

**""The gym is too crowded!""**

Unfortunately, that's every single thing at UCSC, under-equipped, underfunded and overcrowded. But we have to make our peace with it. The best times to go to the gym if you want to avoid crowd are early mornings (6 AM), late evenings (8 PM) or during class hours (This is really useful as you can set aside a lecture time slot for gym in your schedule and enjoy empty gym). Weekends are pretty awesome, as OPERS won't be very crowded. 

The OPERS website offers real-time (lolol) capacity counts : 

https://opers.ucsc.edu/facilities/LiveFacilityCounts.html

And although they are more miss than hit, can be pretty useful.

I was there when they did the filming. It's pretty neat watching a crew show up with around half a million dollars of cameras, lights, microphones, rigs and more. They were super professional, and really great to work with. We were a little concerned about how they might portray our program -- it's still all too easy to do a ""can you believe it, students get credit for playing games"" type segment. I'm glad that this program instead dove into the passion the students have for game design, and what motivated them to pursue this path. It's really inspiring to me to watch this. Enjoy!"

Out of the blue. I don't even know who you are, so I'll just use reddit to reach out. Hopefully this makes it to you. Further descriptors were that you were reading a book and at the very back of the bus, and you asked me first whether the college advising offices (Merrill) were open prior to this line of questioning, so I hope that narrows things down.

So your question was this: 

&gt;""How do you explain people without romantic incentives at our age?""


Or something akin to that. 

My response to you was that ""people have different priorities in life. Some might line up, others don't."" And the rest of my responses to you were pretty much just rephrased in different ways.

And then I asked you whether some random guy asked you out, which you answered that the situation was along those lines. So I'll drop some advice on you, since I didn't get to finish this advice before I left the bus:

There's been a lot of times in my life where I regretted not taking opportunities. Sometimes there are days where I wonder, ""What if I did..."" Most times they are fleeting. Sometimes I'm confident I made the right decision for indecision. Other times, they aren't. And these aren't just moments where I thought about them at first when it happened. You know, like in the moment. It sort of struck me later on, a lot harder than I first really thought about it. Maybe a month, maybe a year. I guess that's what they call regret.

You did mention that you don't think about him all that much. Hope it stays that way, I guess. I mean, you seemed like a person with a kind personality. Doesn't surprise me at all that a guy would ask you out. Shit...I hope I'm not living vicariously or anything.

Now to be fair, I'm a ABD graduate student. So my general life opinions...may be different. My current life priorities are different. I'm focused on finishing my degree, and finding a job.(aka I don't have a life right now) Maybe your line of thinking about your life situation is different than mine. Who knows. I most certainly don't. 

Maybe you have a bit more leeway with things right now. If that's the case, you might as well give it a try.

tl;dr People have different priorities in life. But when the opportunity arises, take it and see where it goes. If it goes well, great. If it goes bad, drop it. Pretty sure you'll never see this post though."

My credentials are that I lived at Kresge last year and my roommates who I've come to be great friends with all volunteer there.
You are all right to be skeptical.  It looks like a super-duper liberal-y sketchy place with some weird-ass hippie people.  And you are right.  It is a weird place.  But that's what makes it fun!!
This school is dominated with CS nerds and STEM majors (like me).  And sometimes, that monotony can create a narrow world view.  If you would like a change of pace to life, I encourage you to expand your worldview and explore the weirdness that makes up the reputation of UCSC.

Some info about the store itself:
-The volunteers are all very polite and super chill (like hippies)
-The food is really good and CHEAP (I don't know who said it was expensive.  They don't mark up anything so everything is actually cheaper than most retail stores.  The only expensive thing there is the Honey Mama's Chocolate but that's because it is originally expensive and totally worth it.  A WHOLE LARGE BAG OF SNACK PEA CHIPS FOR $1.75, A WHOLE LARGE CARTON OF NEWMAN'S LEMONADE FOR $2, etc.)
-Weirdness can be good sometimes.  Look at *insert a certain professor here*, who is one of the weirdest yet best teachers in the CS department.  Thus, I state my case."

Because I was from a different school and only there for the year I was put in the Village, but I made friends from 9 and 10 and Kresge very easily the first couple weeks and we hung out just about every day throughout the year. I loved hiking to class under the tree canopies, climbing the treehouse, working with enthusiastic professors and TAs, and getting stretched to my limits in classes like CMPE100 and then being able to forget it all at the end of the day and go stargazing in the meadows, or goof off in someone's dorms.  
  
  
 But what really stuck out to me that I don't find here at home is how people from every background were able to articulate their ideas in fascinating ways  and I could have just as an engaging conversation with a burnout skipping class as I could with super motivated and disciplined classmates. And if for some reason my friends' schedules didn't line up with mine one day, I could just sit with a random person at the dining hall and get exposed to a whole different world and perspective. The sheer courtesy exchanged between people who didn't know each other in class or riding the bus and the inclusiveness of events like concerts at the trailer park blew my mind. I get that a lot of the vibe is helped by it being a university and people being in close proximity with shared goals in a beautiful campus and some of that just can't be recreated out there in the real world, but I feel like the standard of life I saw there is just a goal everyone would strive for if they got the chance to experience it for themselves. I don't really get any of that here as my University is run a lot more like a huge kind of disconnected high school, people tend to be a bit more abrasive towards one another and keep to themselves to cope with life rather than to take charge of it.   
Anyway, I'm graduating this Spring and thinking about the next step, so I wondered if maybe you guys know people or personally have found similar communities post-Cruz. My thoughts are that San Francisco is a little bit to dense population wise for that kind of life, and I've been looking at Portland as maybe a similar place because they have a forest nearby and similar concern for the environment. But I'm thinking if anyone knows what I might be looking for it would be you guys, so I'd appreciate any input you might have!"

Whenever we have an assignment they'll usually say ""hey wanna work on it together"" and I feel pressured into saying yes because I live with them. 

I feel like they are very dependent on other people to get things done, but at the same time abusive of other people's good will. I've had a class with them before, and they'd want to do everything together. At one point they asked me for help on the homework, which eventually turned to be them just asking ""what'd you get for this?"", the whole time. Once they found out I had access to chegg to answer some of the questions, they made our mutual friend bug me non stop for this ""homework help"". They would also send me answers to the questions even though I hadn't asked, to make it seemed like I owed them something .

Now for this class we got lumped together for a research assignment, but has been very independent up until this point. I feel like they know I don't like working with other people, and the questions for these assignments are simple enough that they can answer them on their own, but I feel like they want my help because they're too lazy to read through the material. The submissions are independent and there is no reason that they can't progress on their own.

I mean I don't mind helping them out every once in a while, but this person literally wants me to sit down with them and proof read their assignments and compare them to my own. One of our other friends who has had classes with them, have set up times, and have gone to wake this person up because they're so used to collaborating with others. However, I'm not their mother, but cant find a way to tell them to lay off.

**""WHAT'S THE BEST COLLEGE FOR ME?""**

Depends on what you're looking for. Honestly, it doesn't really matter when it comes down to your overall college experience but here are just some things I noticed about each college (just addin' to the gazillion pros and cons posts out there about colleges).

**OAKES** (the college no one talks about and hardest to get any info on)

I feel like a lot of the people who ended up here didn't really sign up for the Oakes life but honestly it gets trashed a lot more than it should be. I lived here during freshmen year, and it wasn't as terrible as people claimed

**CONS**

* IT'S A PAIN IN THE ASS getting anywhere, and at the beginning of the year no one is going to want to come visit you lol. But you're going to get the sexiest legs and lose hella weight climbing all those stairs to get to and from the RCC dining hall. You're going to feel kind of isolated but honestly this turns out to be kind of a pro rather than con especially if you're introverted.
* the dorms look kind of crusty and sad from the outside but the inside is bigger than alot of the rooms at other colleges
* no panini press


 **PROS**

* pretty quiet usually, just a lot of chill potheads who go to the benches on the hill outside to smoke; not a lot of partying
* has one of the better dining halls
* OAKES CAFE IS THE BEST PLACE TO SPEND FLEXIS VERY WORTH YOU'RE BLESSED
* core class is pretty easy/plenaries only once in a while
* the sunset is fucking beautiful especially from the hill with the benches
* closest to getting off campus
* your legs are going to look so great after just the first quarter and you're going to lose at least 15 pounds walking to all your classes cause you're going to learn how unreliable busses are and that it's just faster to walk
* rachel carson dining hall (you share with RCC) has had the steadiest stream of decent dining hall food on campus at least from my experience
* pretty diverse group of people??
* close to porter meadows if you into sketch hippie forest parties

ok not experienced with other colleges so here's just some stuff i heard

**RACHEL CARSON**

**CONS**

* apparently there's a lot of orgies? kinda nasty? unless you a wild child and into that kind of stuff
* like Oakes, kind of isolated and hard to get anywhere
* no panini press

**PROS**

* YOU DON'T HAVE TO CLIMB A FUCKING MOUNTAIN to get to the dining hall :)
* decent dining hall
* pretty quiet, cute suburban vibes???
* BEAUTIFUL SUNSET YOU SEE OCEAN FROM SOME BUILDINGS AMAZING VIEW PRICELESS

**PORTER** 

**CONS**

* shittiest dining hall (i feel like almost everyone agrees that it's the crustiest place to eat and somehow even though the food is probably the same at every dining hall Porter manages to make it taste more like ass)
* pretty dank (highkey that's all of UCSC but whatever)

**PROS**

* the dankest, hippiest, arty boiest college of them all if you into that life
* so many hipsters (literally almost everyone dresses like they popped out of some hipster tumblr blog)
* alot of art funding
* basically if you're an arty kid, into hipster stuff, the usual stuff, THIS COLLEGE WAS LITERALLY MADE AND MOLDED FOR YOU
* sketchy forest parties at Porter meadows all the time
* closest to the Squiggly (one of the must go places and best places to have talks and have chill hangouts and have nice views
* Porter Caves is pretty cool
* Porter just has a lot of cool things
* dorms have elevators
* apartments are pretty nice
* panini press somewhat makes up for the crustiness of dining hall

**COWELL/STEVENSON**

* party frat gym boys?
* preppy
* you like muscles you come here
* nice opers view
* IN THE MIDDLE OF EVERYTHING, IT'S AMAZING, YOU ONLY HAVE TO WALK MAX LIKE 7 MIN TO GET ANYWHERE
* PANINI PRESS

**MERRILL**

* has a mexican food place which isn't bad
* honestly I shouldn't complaining about Oakes after dealing with the Merrill hill; good luck 
* KZSC the radio station is there and it's a really cool place to volunteer if you're into music/trying to get into DJing and stuff
* their food is also pretty good but if you don't live there it's not worth climbing the hill

**C9/C10**

* ALL THE ASIANS 
* nice dorms
* nice looking dining hall, tiny ass portions so you have to go up at least 5 times before you full, food isn't that great honestly compared to presentation
* close to everything too
* newest, nicest dorms - rooms kinda tiny though


**WHERE'S THE BEST DINING HALL**

-Cowell/Stevenson is my personal favorite - they give large portions, food is quality, their dining hall is pretty clean, they have a panini press.

-Rachel Carson and Merrill comes second. Sucks they don't have a panini press.

-Everything else is around same level of mehness.


**FRIENDS?**

Be proactive from the beginning. No one is going to approach you first. Everyone is desperate for friends at the beginning and will welcome anyone who approaches them. At least till half way through first quarter, than everyone starts finding their groups and get more picky about who they hang out with.

You're going to most likely struggle finding a group of people you like at the beginning. Just remember to keep an open mind, you're most likely not going to be able to create the same type of friend group you had in high school, everyone's characters will evolve and unfold the more you talk to them (everyone's a lil awkward and weird when you first meet them but often after a couple weeks of persevering through awkward small talk you'll find their quirks and connect better and find an amazing friendship!!). 

Most likely, you're going to join the freshmen group on facebook and everyone's going to make cringey profiles talking about stuff they like blablabla that they regret making a couple months into college. Honestly, the people you befriend over the summer in that group...you'll more than likely never see them again/avoid them/realize they're not who they portrayed in their profiles and disconnect. I'd just wait till the school year starts and find people through clubs or on your floor. Just remember, that more often than not the people you become friends is because of their character not what tv show they liked. AND it's really hard to tell what their real personality is from a short online profile and some messaging. (THIS APPLIES TO FINDING ROOMMATES TOO).

Joining clubs is actually a really fast way to find a supportive community which will become like family and find a group of friends within that community.


**JUST A COOL KID TRYING TO FIND COLLEGE PARTIES**

Uh...UCSC is definitely not a party school. Smoking weed and doing really intense drugs in the forest hell ya boy you found your place but you definitely won't find any typical college parties on campus. There might be some drinking ""parties"" happening in dorms from time to time before NAs and csos come to shut it down but if you want legit college parties join a frat, befriend someone in a frat and go to the ones off campus. 

If you're content with UCSC's nature hippie parties Pogonip and Porter meadows are the places to go - except they get shut down pretty fast usually.

**HOW HIPPIE/SJW IS THIS SCHOOL**

People make it sound like everyone at this school has dreadlocks, is an insane SJW, smoking banana slugs in the trees 24/7, annoying vegan, etc. etc. etc. they're more or less very wrong???

This school is pretty normal? Normal people? Everyone is pretty chill and nice, down-to-earth, pretty stress free and less competitive compared to other schools from my experience. 


**EMBARRASSED/NOT THAT HYPED ABOUT COMING TO UCSC**

Okay, so as your typical asian kid who grew up with people expecting me to end up at an ivy or top-tier UC, seeing that UCSC was one of the only UC's I got into was disappointing to say the least?
You'll definitely feel somewhat miserable during your last couple months of high school when people make passive aggressive jokes about the ""weed"" school and you might even feel somewhat sub-human depending on how bad it gets.

But honestly, college is what you make of it. If you keep up the mentality that you're attending a shitty school and that you hate everything, you'll fail to ever be happy with yourself and you'll be giving into people's judgement.

Santa Cruz is a beautiful school with lovely people and you'll soon realize how much this school has to offer. It's up to you on how you want to portray Santa Cruz and you should seek out the better parts of this school rather than sitting in your puddle of misery.

Your experience definitely depends on what sort of people you meet and how hard you try, so don't blame the school if you have a bad time here.


**THINGS TO DO IN SANTA CRUZ**

Bruh, you tell me.

Just kidding, like you'd expect, this is a beach town so things to do...are kind of sparse?

-The beaches are beautiful. I highly recommend you check out Davenport or Natural Bridges. 

-The Catalyst actually has a lot of decent concerts and tickets are pretty cheap compared to other places so definitely check that out (a lot of indie bands).

-Thrifting if you into that.

-Capitola mall kind of sucks but it's there if you need it.

-San Jose is an hour away and you can just take the 17 to get there. There's a lot more stuff to do there.

-Hiking!! Garden of Eden gets hyped up alot. 

-There's an escape room downtown but I never tried it. 

-Boardwalk (but kind of too expensive to go as a college kid and not that worth it).

-Cute cafe's for studying: Lulu's and verve's.

-Surfing and chilling at the beach is probably the best you can do here though.


**DECENT PLACES TO EAT/WHERE DO YOU GET BOBA**

Santa Cruz food sucks. And is overpriced.
But dining hall food won't be as great as it seemed at least two months into the year so some decent places that you should check out are:

-Los pericos (the most decent legit mexican food you can get here; it's pretty good)

-Chipotle exists near downtown. 

-Lillian's is a personal favorite. VERY BOUGIE though so I mean go if you have the money. They have really good pasta and other italian food though. Worth the priciness.

-I Love Sushi, May's Sushi (AYCE), Akira's for aight decent sushi

-Sandwich spot

-Woodstock's

-Betty's Sandwiches

-Asian Express (capitola) the most decent pho you'll get near here (don't fall for betty's noodles)

- L&amp;L HAS REALLY CHEAP GOOD HAWAIIAN FOOD HIGHLY RECOMMEND

place that you'll hear about but i personally don't recommend

-Betty's noodles: like the only asian place near school but not really worth unless you're so desperate to the point you want to eat noodles in a bowl of water; i'd just recommend you bus it to sj on the weekend or something if you get to that point

BOBA!! Milk tea kinda sucks in Santa Cruz. There's Tea zone but it isn't that great honestly. Unpopular opinion: I prefer iveta's milk tea over tea zone's? Quickly's is kind of awful too but whatever you've got to make do. 

But good news!! Almost every single fundraiser that happens in the Quarry is a boba fundraiser so you can just fulfill you boba cravings there cause they bring all of San Jose's decent ones right to you like Happy Lemon, Pekoe, etc.!!! You'll live.

K that be all bye.
Congrats getting in btw!"
84o3wl,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/84o3wl/advice_for_upcoming_cs_majors/,Advice for Upcoming CS Majors,76,23,2018-03-15 10:08:49,"I’ve been seeing a lot of posts about students getting into UCSC as a CS major and are worried about the state of Computer Science. I studied from UCSC from 2012 to 2016, and it was hard to get classes back then as well. I’ve also mentored students graduating in 2018 and 2019, and they’re having it just as hard as anyone else. I can understand this fact: If you are coming in as a CS major without anything extra in terms of AP classes or summer classes under your belt, you’re going to have a hard (but not impossible) time. 

Here are some tactics I’ve seen students do that make them successful.

UCSC prioritizes enrollment times by the number of credits a student has. IIRC it was like 49.5 to be a sophomore, 89.5 to be a junior, and 100-soemthing to be a senior. Students with 3+ AP Classes + a CC course + they take their 15 units fall quarter will quickly become sophomore standing in their first year. These are the students who are able to take classes a day earlier than their peers. Now imagine these same students applying for 20+ credits per quarter. There are students taking 24-30 units per quarter in order to increase their credit count (and they also do well in these classes), and then take summer courses. A freshmen taking CS101 their summer before sophomore year will allow them to potentially finish their core requirements by the end of their sophomore year. That’s huge, and that allows them to be even junior standing by the middle/end of their sophomore year. 

Taking something from this – the more credits you have, the better off you’ll be getting classes. Tactics such as taking more credits per quarter, taking summer classes, or independent study credits with a research team, are all methods of gaining additional credits. 

Now, *putting on developers hat*. If you want to succeed. Taking classes ONLY at ucsc is not sufficient in succeeding after graduation. If you are a freshmen, you should start learning basics and doing small projects freshmen year, building up to an internship the summer between freshmen and sophomore year. If you start early, you can get at least 2-3 internships by the time you graduate college and applying to full time jobs. These will pay off much more than classes and will make you look way better competitively than students who take classes, get an A, and have no projects or internships on their resumes. Take up hackerrank, leetcode easy/medium, cracking the coding interview, and treat it as your weekly routine to do at least one problem a week when you’re just starting school. They all add up and by the time you’re at your senior year, you’ll be incredibly job ready competitive offers in the horizons. 

I'm always available for a PM if anyone has concerns or questions regarding how to prep for the job market! Love to help out new developers from UCSC and watch them succeed.

So far I have learned a lot, most of my professors have been incredible as they are passionate about what they are teaching and they care about how much their students learn. Yes objectively UCSC is not the best UC in the system but in my opinion that holds no value. I believe college is what you make it. If you are actively trying to learn, interested in what you are learning, and putting yourself out for internships you will be successful no matter what school you attend. While UCSC is no Harvard or MIT, you have to put things in perspective. Those high ranking colleges have such low acceptance rates because they want the best of the best. This is going to sound a bit harsh but, if you are the best of the best you most likely wont attend UCSC. That however does not diminish the quality of the school. If UCSC is the right place for you and you make the best out of it, then you will fine. Again, I am a first year so I am no where near experienced enough to talk about this and just wanted to voice how my experience of this school has been so far. If you have anything to say feel free to reply! "

These last 4 and a half years at UCSC have been the longest and hardest yet quickest journey I've ever been on. As I'm about to graduate this quarter I look back at all the times I've been through and can seriously say I'm going to miss this place. From the sick, stressed out study sessions at 4am, to the parties I've attended where I question my normality, to the incredibly amount of time spent on things that were not the least bit productive, it's hard for me to think of any other way I would've wanted my college career to go.

Upon graduating with a computer science degree I'll start working for a tech company in the silicon valley. While I'm incredibly proud of myself for reaching this milestone as someone who came in undeclared and didn't start coding until sophomore year, there is also a definite hint of sadness and worry as I enter this next phase of my life. I'm sad that I'm getting older, I wish I could just remain in this fairy-tale like experience that is college and school in general for longer. I'm worried that once I start working the next couple decades of my life will just pass by in a routine like fashion. You always hear adults saying things like ""it felt like just yesterday I was in my early 20's"", well I don't want that to be the case, I want my life to remain surprising and interesting.

College is awesome because each day can be different and your free time can be spent however you like. You can go get drunk on a wednesday, gym in between classes, or decide to drive to the beach on a thursday and just live your life how you decide.

Sorry if this seems unwarranted, I know that I should feel incredibly happy to be in the position I am but I can't help but feel these other feelings as well. For those of you still in college, enjoy every day of it. We're all blessed to be able to pursue the things we want and have this time as young adults to explore yourself and become the person you want to be. You can grow so much in such a short amount of time if you put yourself out there and don't let your life stagnate. Keep making yourself uncomfortable, this is the best time in your life to fuck up!"

------------

I remember when I was a young freshman. I never experienced the friday $5 sub. The first time I tried it, it was a impulse purchase. Nothing about desire, just opportunity. I took my first bite.

And in my mouth, the overflowing sensations of the fresh tomatoes picked from the fields of florence, crunchy lettuce, supple cheese curdled from the happiest cows on the fields of plenty. Savoury ham, tasteful turkey, cold cut beef, the perfected carving of meat with stone cold blades, shearing flesh from bone. The light, reenforcing tangy but subtle presence of the sourdough bread. The fractured staining of the flour, harvested from the purple fields of Assyria and ground to the finest angelic power with stones that bore the weight of Christ. It was the most wonderful sandwich I ever had.

There was no other substitution. The next friday, I bought the same sandwich. But I microwaved it. And there was only description of stimulation of my taste buds that could only be reserved for the magnificence of cosmic supernovas.

Every friday of every week after that, I desired for that same friday $5 discount sandwich. Every week, I walked down to safeway. Didn't take the bus, I just walked. Every week, every year, I made the journey to safeway from my dormitory, from my campus apartment, from my apartment, and then from my house. It was a pilgrimage every time. The UCSC experience was not complete without the weekly friday $5 discount sub.

Until one day...they weren't there.

I looked all over safeway. I looked all over its food aisles, the lunch meat sections, the produce aisles. The deli aisle, where the sandwiches were from. They weren't there. They were gone.

It was desperation. I looked everywhere for them. I wished they were there. Bottles of the cheapest liquors lined up my floor quickly, my mind becoming a haze. And one day, it stopped. I gave up all hope, knowing they will never return.

I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Yerba Matés in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bottles and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me blabbering to the girl about his research in astronomy or some shit. I don’t even think ""infetterence"" is a word. After she scanned each bottle and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."

I've made many friends, but have also encountered a level of arrogance and intellectual superiority I did not encounter at community college. Naturally, there are many whip smart researchers here and further, I am sure, many people convey this attitude out of their own insecurity as well. Yet, it gets to me, at times. 

I have ADHD and sometimes underperform in the classroom because I can't focus well. I make silly mistakes while assisting with research that seem atypical and kind of embarrass me. I've tested well below the average in some of my STEM classes (once again, this is probably lack of commitment, not ability, at least I keep trying to tell myself that).

Apart from just the feelings of imposter syndrome, I often don't feel accepted at this school. At my CC, which had quite a large volume of students (more than UCSC), I constantly felt accepted and loved by everyone. I notice some students here are very cliquey, will scowl at you when you simply try to smile at them, and some people are blatantly rude to me. I know some of this may be the anxiety and depression these other students are facing and has nothing to do with me but it's hard to remember that in the moment. I know I have friends here and have to ignore the others, and I am a bit older (almost 26) and have been living on my own for a *long* time and am probably just in a different stage than some of the other students, but it gets to me sometimes. 

Ultimately, I really love it here, but man I am more depressed and anxious than I used to be, and I get the feeling I'm not the only one. "

--
Folks, you’ve heard from Blumenthal about the strike, so I humbly ask that you read about it from the perspective of a fellow grad student, with the hope that you consider joining tomorrow.


At 3:30 am today, on that blurry borderline between late night and early morning, I got up and hopped in a ride to campus. Within hours, joining a statewide work stoppage including 53,000 workers from three unions, hundreds of UCSC students and workers had shown up to protest a low-wage, union-busting contract that the UC administration has forced on AFSCME service workers.


The UC says that to give these workers -- custodial, maintenance, dining hall, and other service staff -- a better contract would be “unfair to other UC employees.” How improving the compensation of the lowest-paid university workers is unfair to me as a graduate student instructor, I have no clue. What seems more unfair is to debilitate their union and force on them what amounts to a 0% wage increase when the highest paid UC administrators enjoyed a 64% increase in wages between 2005 and 2015. 


In addition to the usual divide-and-conquer rhetorical strategy, the UC resorted today to its other favorite way of dealing with dissent: violent repression. The administration, in advance, brought in about 40 cops from the California Highway Patrol with riot gear, jackboots, and a number of motorcycles, gathering additional officers and equipment from all over the Bay Area. One windowless van was labelled “Alameda Sheriff's Department.” They said they were there to protect us, but did nothing when a car drove through a line of protesters, injuring one.


By noon, the cops had arrested one protester and handed out numerous citations to others. Demonstrators at the West Entrance reported that police would order them to get on the sidewalk, then block their pathways to do so and slap the “offender” with a ticket. After creating chaos on the picket line with this tactic, they cuffed and drove off with a graduate student and UAW 2865 member who did nothing wrong except get caught between an officer and the person that the officer had decided to target with a ticket.


As for the second arrest of the day, I witnessed an officer step into a crosswalk as a student crossed (with the “walk” light in his favor), shoulder-check the student, act incredulously as if the student had himself instigated the incident, and violently drag him away in a transparent attempt to fabricate charges against an innocent person. The student ended up in the back of the ominous Alameda sheriff's van after a pack of blue uniforms piled onto him.


Their strategy is to make protest seem risky -- by saddling people with fines, arrests, or student conduct charges -- with the hopes that students will stop participating in the next two days. 


This isn’t the first time this has happened at Santa Cruz. In 2014, on the first morning of a two-day strike by UAW 2865, representing TAs, GSIs, tutors, and readers, police (also brought in from as far as Davis) arrested several grad student union members engaged in a legal picket, as well as a nearby camera operator and a number of other supportive students, making 20 arrests in a few hours. But if the hope was to weaken turnout for the next day, the strategy backfired: instead, outraged students and workers turned out in droves and made the second day even bigger than the first. It was an important if unfortunate step for an escalating movement that achieved a 20% wage increase for academic workers in our next four year contract, among other benefits.


Now is the time, once again, to react powerfully to UC repression. The current UAW 2865 contract ends this June, and already the negotiations for a new one show little promise. When the UC decides to repress and rebuff AFSCME worker demands, it means they will do the same to us. The only option is to show that we will not accept it. We did it in 2014 after the administration’s cops attacked us, and we can do it again now. 


Without a doubt, it sucks to miss a day of teaching, learning, or research to have to fight back against a repressive and exploitative administration. Yet if we don’t, what will be the future of the university except a farcical version of all these activities that we value?


The UC administration has shown for years that it will always choose to cut educational quality, slash the compensation of workers, and raise students’ tuition. Other things remaining equal, it has no inclination but to let the whole system rot while bankers, private contractors, and real estate developers get rich off its directionless growth. Other things, however, need not remain equal. We can all be a new variable in their blind calculus. Tomorrow, students and workers must get together and stand up against the university’s violent and dishonest tactics. I’m going to get up early again and slog to the lines again because I can’t stand the alternative. I hope you will join me. If a day lost on strike is a “disruption” to the UC’s mission, as Blumenthal says, it is a necessary one, because the only other thing on offer is to abandon that mission completely.

Stuck in a series of zero-g environments, you have to propel your little space-person to the exit, and not by conveniently blasting your jetpack. No, that only has a single charge. After that, you'll have to pick up space debris and fling it in front of you to shoot yourself backwards. You'll get a better score if you reach the end of each level with your collected rubbish intact, but boy is it difficult in this inventive arcade puzzle game.

Just was reading about the measure 69 that you guys passed, which will raise your transportation fee to $170 from $111 by 2020. I feel like I must be reading something wrong, since that just seems astronomically high given how many complaints I hear about Metro's service to campus.

Here are some comparisons: 
* (base comparison) **UCSC $111 -&gt; $170** Campus shuttles, night owl service, and SCMTD buses. Can't comment on quality since I don't attend.
* **Western Washington University (my school) $26.25** City buses (including commuter routes between counties, runs unscheduled buses when overcrowding occurs) and late night shuttle service. 
* **University Washington, Seattle $84** Provides access to 6 transit systems, the light rail, city ferry system, streetcar, and commuter train system to neighboring cities. 
* **Cal Poly, SLO $0** University subsidizes bus system using parking permit fees.
* **UCLA $65** Access to Metro buses and light rail.

I don't understand why UCSC's fee needs to be so high when it doesn't seem like you're getting as much for your money as any of these other comparisons. Am I missing something significant here? Where's the money going? 

Note: I'm not anti transit at all. I ride the bus every day to school and around town even though I have a car. I just feel like the service should match the price. "

This wastes a lot of your time and ours. In addition, you are doing yourself a disservice by not learning. How do you expect to get a job or finish your upper divs without knowing even the basics?

You are paying a lot of money to be here and will have to pay even more when you must retake courses. 

Most students complain about not getting into classes... That could nearly be fixed if cheaters didn't need to retake the class! So think of your classmates as well next time you think about copying something. And for the others, if you see cheating, report it.

I graduated from UCSC back in March and just landed my first well-paying job with a reputable company. I know the transition from undergrad to employment can be a really hard time, so I just wanted to share some of the things I would want to hear when I started.

* The transition from structured school life to unemployment can make you feel depressed, bored, useless, etc. try to keep busy and keep some sort of routine to help

* You probably wont hear back from 95% of the places you apply to. Job searching is a numbers game, cast a wide net. I applied to at least 100+ jobs and was interviewed for only 4. Did not recieve any other contact from the other companies just confirmations that they recieved my email. 

* I wish I started months before I graduated, but that's probably not helpful for you to hear now. Just a heads up for anyone who's still in school

* Use any and all connections to get your resume out there. Make sure that all your family and friends know that your looking for a job in whatever field. I got my first interview with the job I was hired at after being referred by a friend of a friend who was a realator who had sold a house to the hiring manager. You never know

* Practice outloud for interviews with someone else. Make sure you have a good quick shpeel for the inevitable ""Tell me about yourself?"" question that leads off every interview

* Look up common behavioral interview questions and formulate effective responses to them using the [SOAR](http://www.humanresources.com/491/the-soar-answer-model/) answer model

* Might want to put down the weed. It really depends on the industry your working for, but if its a job where you'll be working in potentially harmful environments or for a big old-school company you'll likely be drug tested and it's not worth the stress of trying to ""detox"" the 3 days leading up to a screen. Plus studies have shown it can can fuck with the dopamine receptors in the part of your brain responsible for motivation. 

* I've also been told to take the any and all jobs in the industry you want to work for jsut to get your foot in the door, but I ended up not taking that advice. I turned down a less-desirable job offer knowing I had an interview coming up and about a 20% chance at getting  a job I really wanted.


I might add to this list later when more things come to mind. Sorry for the wall of text. I definitely didn't follow all this advice all the time, but I wish I did. Keep it up Slugs, if I can do it anyone can. Really I mean that"

Sometime late in the quarter, midterm season. Everybody hustling and bustling about, studying and doing their own thing.

This was at S&amp;E. You know those shitty two computers at the very bottom floor next to that snack vending machine that's either empty or broken? Yeah, it was at those computers.

I walked up, and sat down in one of those seats in front of those computers. Cracked open my textbook for whatever it was I was studying for. Opened my laptop, started to study (aka procrastinating). A little exhausted with my life, contemplating dying for a while. When I noticed a small envelope that was resting on the surface of where the computers were placed. A decently well decorated envelope, with stickers and hand drawn random stuff on it. Designs looked kind of oriental from what I remember. I opened the envelope, and there was a gift card of some kind in there. Target or Macy's or something. Nothing too special.

To give a little more perspective, I was in a pretty rotten mood that day. Pretty sure I got one of my midterms back where I got a 1. Got in a fight with my parents prior to that, got fired from my job. Life was(is) pretty shit as usual. So I did a pretty shite thing. I just tossed the envelope in the air, and it landed behind one of the computers. Weird thing how that happens.

Little more than half an hour later, a bunch of asians walked into the area behind me. You know, the area with the maps that nobody reads and the windows that nobody cleans. And they were just talking about some event or whatnot, I don't remember. Then one of them walks up to me and asks,

""Have you seen an envelope lying around here?""

To which I responded with my most dull,

""Nope.""

The girl who asked me sounded exasperated, and brought a bunch of her friends to search for the envelope. When one of them found the envelope that I threw, that same girl exclaimed,

""Oh my gosh, whoever put the envelope here must have put it here so nobody would steal it and we can find it later. Bless this person, absolutely bless him.""

The entire time she said that she looked at me the whole time. So I think she figured out that I was the one who put the envelope there, idk. It was honestly kind of uncomfortable. Afterwards, all of them promptly left.

For that night, when I tried to go to sleep. I remember tha tI failed at everything, including to try to be a dick.

So, to that group of people who found their envelope. While I'm pretty sure you misinterpreted my intentions as being a saintly person...I was being a dick.

Okay, I don't feel bad for doing any of the above. I just wanted to share my story.

tl;dr Was a dick. Praised for a non-existent good deed. Feels weird."

To: UC Santa Cruz faculty and staff

From: Dave Keller, Executive Director, Housing Services

Subject: Renting a room to a student

 

Dear faculty and staff, 



As you no doubt know, there is a significant housing crisis in Santa Cruz, and I am writing to you today to see if you may be able to help us address it by offering a room for rent in your home to a UCSC student this fall. We currently have several hundred students without housing guarantees on the waiting list for housing, and not nearly enough rentals offered in our available Community Rentals listings to accommodate these students.


You may wish to consider offering rental housing in your home for the academic year, or perhaps for a shorter period. It is possible to identify a student who just needs a place to stay until housing becomes available on campus. We have on campus spaces open up when students graduate after fall or winter quarter, or otherwise depart the university.


The need is real and it is urgent, so I am reaching out to the faculty and staff community for help. Offering a room in your home to a student who has not been able to find housing for the school year would be a tremendous support to their success at UCSC.


The Community Rentals Office located in room 104 at the Hahn Student Services Building is standing by to assist you in getting your listing posted, and to support you in any other way in this process. I invite you to review the web page, stop by the office, or contact Community Rentals at communityrentals@ucsc.edu or (831) 459-4435 with any questions.


Thank you for considering this opportunity to help a student in need of housing. Please feel free to broadly share this message with your local networks.


Appreciatively,


Dave Keller

Executive Director, Housing Services"

Go hit up Funk Night @ The Crepe place every freaking TUESDAY! Disclaimer: **I don't work at or am in any away affiliated with the place.** It just think it is the most fun to be had in SC on a Tuesday night.

&amp;#x200B;

I started to going to funk night this summer and it was fucking mental. I mean the small dance floor was absolutely packed, steaming and sweaty with people. You had people jumping around in unison &amp; chanting, people crowd surfing, and crazy ecstatic dancing, its amazing. I have been to many concerts/shows but for $6 you can not beat the enjoyment or fun on a Tuesday night.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't know how to dance? Perfect, almost nobody does and that's why its awesome. No one cares.

Don't have a car? Public transit, uber, lyft, hitch hike. I mean it's only in mid-town, not too far way and there is an awesome noodle spot across the street for late night food. Beside do you really have anything better to do on a Tuesday night??

What if I'm not 21? Funk night is 18 y.o.+, so your chilling it just means you can't drink. Besides there are local High School kids getting in with ""dubious"" forms of identification, so I'm sure that, as a slug, you can get in.

There were a lot of family complications and money issues that caused me to withdraw from UC Davis. I went back to community college (Los Rios district in Sacramento County) and applied to multiple UC systems again. This time I was eligible to apply as an independent so I did not have to rely on my broken family household, and could receive the aid through loans and grants to finish school. During my application process I listed all school's I was transferring from including a community college I went to in the district in which I only failed classes at and had a couple withdraws. I also talked about my experience at UCD in my personal statements/inquiry portion and listed UCD as a school I was in academic probation for. I got accepted to UCSC and was very happy to progress forward. After my junior year and a summer session I was now heading into my senior year. But I got a letter saying I didn't include UC Davis grades right after my summer session ended. They said I tried to falsify information and that I'm subjected to be kicked out of UCSC. I honestly did not know I had to include UC information on a UC application. I was open about my attendance at UCD throughout the application so I was not trying to hide any information. As I said, I listed it for previous school's I had been on probation for and I talked about my experience there. I did not try to hide UCD so why wait until I completed a full year and summer to then say I'm getting kicked out? I took a lot of loans out to be able to pay for the academic year.

To begin with, it’s an amazing beautiful school with many research opportunities or so I’ve heard.

However, I’m leaving after this quarter. This school is not the place to be if you are looking for a party school. Everyone that I have met here so far is very cliquey and do not enjoy adding people to their friend groups. My roomate and I were very open to meeting new people via attending various campus events and no one was very welcoming. This school is more for people who enjoy a laid-back vibe. The reason I am transferring is because I did not get into UCSB and decided to settle for Santa Cruz since I thought I would be able to make the most out of it and enjoy my time. However, I have gotten so miserable on the weekends it’s unbearable. Throughout the school week, I don’t mind living here since I have homework and classes. If you did not get accepted to the school of your choice, don’t settle!!!! It’s not worth the tuition money at all. I didn’t get any financial aid which just makes attending this school not worth it to me.

Overall: attend this school if you are a chill, more introverted person &amp; don’t settle!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! just go to cc it’s not bad and u save sooo much more money &amp; there’s TAG options too!!!!! thank u for coming to my ted talk :)"

I failed two classes this quarter. Ams 131 (Prado) with a D and CMPS 101 with a C- (yes I somehow managed to fail Tantalo, regretting so much for not putting enough time into his class, although I did manage to learn some stuff like master theorem). I was enrolled in CMPS 102 but got dropped and still waitlisted (62) for CMPE 110. I am enrolled in Bailey's 101 and trying to go for Finkelstein's 101 (waitlisted 17). It totally messed up my schedule now that I can't take 102 next quarter and in spring it would be with avg so probably going to wait till next year for 102. Assuming I pass 101 (gonna make sure I do) should I take 102 in the spring with avg or wait since most classes don't have 102 as prereq. Since 102 is a continuation of 101 I would assume it would be best to take it right after 101 but from what I have seen on Reddit about avg it might not be a good choice. Also I am most likely going to retake Ams 131/CMPE 107 next year as well since I plan to take CMPS 111 and 130 this spring. Would 107 be a better choice since I didn't pass 131 and who are some good professors for 107? I might take it in the summer but I am currently not sure with the schedule and whether I am going to take classes during the summer. I know that my problem is being lazy and procrastinating and that I need to spend more time studying and etc but I am sure you guys know those are like diseases that are hard to cure and first quarter with 8am and two night classes all lasting for 1.5 hours didn't help (not trying to make excuses, I know it is completely my fault for failing). Well I guess good news is that I at least passed my third class with an A. Also if anyone have the solutions to Tantalo's homework and exams saved, it would be nice to have them to study but it may be considered bad conduct since he removed them (not trying to cheat for future Tantalo 101 students).

Then I’m fine and something in my head just switches and I just feel like I’m going crazy. 
I am lucky to have a partner who is trying to help as much as possible but today we called caps and they said the next possible REFERRAL appointment isn’t until next week. 
Then I would still be waiting for an appointment after that depending on who I’m referred to. 

I am obviously in a crisis and that was all they could give me, but there should be more efficient ways to take care of the mental health of UCSC students.

I thought I could cope with my depression this quarter, but it is literally tearing my life apart and I literally have no one to talk to, any way to raise my grades, and honestly no more willpower to do anything but cry in my room and sleep. My financial aid is probably going to be messed up after this quarter, my parents are going to be disappointed in me, and I just feel like I'm literally living in a nightmare everyday. On top of all of this, I'm starting to develop some sort of agoraphobia to this place. I'm scared of going to the dining halls, I'm scared to step out of my room everyday, and I'm scared to even get out of my bed everyday.

The one I have right now is terrible. She spends like 20 mins during our sessions on the computer looking up school administrative policies (like what would happen if I failed a class, etc) when I already told her the answers (I get she has to verify but can’t she do it after my session? Especially when I’ve told her the right information every time so far?). I went to CAPS to get coping mechanisms for a few problems but she spends the whole session lecturing me on why I should tell my parents I have mental health issues (like girl it’s been 8 years.....if I was gonna tell them I would have already done it.....having a random lady go “you should tell them :)” isn’t magically going to convince me.....obviously if my parents weren’t horrible people I would tell them......) and she doesn’t listen when I say she’s wasting time by lecturing me on that. She literally recommended I go to the anxiety workshop when I don’t have anxiety, and when I said “why would i go to the anxiety workshop if I don’t have anxiety” she said “oh...you’re right”. Today at our appointment she was literally 15 minutes late to calling me back to her office and she was crying, and our session literally started with me asking HER if she was ok. 

Honestly I’m pretty pissed because you typically only get 3 or 4 sessions a school year and she’s completely wasted my time at 2 sessions already. Is there a way for me to report her or something? Typically I would never do it but she’s a PHD student and literally horrible, she makes me leave feeling way worse than I come in and honestly her supervisor probably needs to know she’s doing a horrible job. Like crying during someone else’s session? Really? Also, does anyone know if I switch therapists, will they give me the full 4 sessions and just not count these 2 wasted ones? 

I know this is kinda a niche question but I’m just wondering if anyone has experience with something like this. Also, I just want to say, don’t let this post discourage you from going to CAPS. I went last year and my therapist was incredible. He even extended my sessions to 10+ times because I was such a mess. It just seems like this lady I have now is really, really bad at it. "

Especially compared to our ridiculously long summer? It feels like the moment you settle into spring break, spring quarter is 2 days away, which can make the break less than relaxing. Considering our winter break is three weeks, I think an extra week for spring break is completely reasonable; it’s not like fall quarter is any longer than winter quarter. Frankly winter quarter feels even longer than fall. It seems like so many students experience a lot more burnout during winter quarter as well, so I feel like adding an extra week to spring break could help students feel less burnout during spring. I would gladly trade a week of summer break if it meant we got an extra week of spring break, our summer break is almost comically long and when you have friends that go to other non-UCs, that last 3 weeks of summer can be pretty dull. 

TL,DR: spring break is way too short, I would gladly take a shorter summer if it meant we get a longer spring, and a longer spring break might help prevent student burnout in the spring and winter quarters. "

-	*Lost Boys.* Classic cheesy ‘80s horror movie set in “Santa Carla,” the murder capital of the world. It’s got vampires, motorcycles, Corey Feldman, and a soundtrack filled with new wave and ‘80s pop rock; what more could you want? It also gives a very accurate picture of Santa Cruz at the time if you want a bit of a peak into the past. This is probably the most classic movie filmed in Santa Cruz, there’s even a tour you can take that shows you where everything was shot and Streetlight Records sells Santa Carla t-shirts. 
-	*Heartbeeps.* Andy Kaufman’s first and only major film role is widely considered one of the worst movies of all time, and while I can see why, I believe most of the things people criticize it for were intentional. It’s a love story about robots that pays homage and satirizes a lot of classic romance story stereotypes. Most of the movie was filmed in the Santa Cruz hills.
-	*Killer Klowns From Outer Space.* Another ‘80s horror movie but this one is intentionally silly. For a movie with a $1.8 million budget, it has incredible special effects throughout — most if not all of them are practical effects, whether they be a real popcorn gun, claymation, or giant suits. The acting is godawful and it’s filled with hilariously dumb death scenes. A lot of the filming was done in Watsonville but it’s obvious a lot was also done in the Santa Cruz hills and of course, the Boardwalk. 
-	***Glory Daze***. This one deserves a special shoutout because I think a lot of people haven’t heard of it AND it’s the one students would have the most connection to. Glory Daze follows a group of art students from UC Santa Cruz trying to adjust to life after graduation, with varying levels of success. What’s great about this movie is that it was made by a UC Santa Cruz student and as a result it gives an extremely accurate characterization of the school along with ACTUALLY BEING FILMED ON CAMPUS (and the city itself). This doesn’t just have the tenuous connection a lot of movies have by filming at the Boardwalk, this is a movie made by a UC Santa Cruz student *for* UC Santa Cruz students. If that doesn’t grab your attention, it’s also one of those movies that features a lot of now-superstars before they got famous, including Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Sam Rockwell, Alyssa Milano, Brendan Fraser, Leah Remini, and Matthew McConaughey. This one has personal significance to me and I think it will to you too. "

The whole idea is to inconvenience the students to the point where they complain to the admin about the injustices the workers face. No student (at least anyone I know) does this. The strikes last 1-3 days and then boom, everything is back to normal. While this is something I’d rather not happen, the strikers need to go harder. They need to create an inconvenience to the point where the University will HAVE to cancel finals or strike for a week straight and go beyond the minor inconveniences of lack of food or lack of transportation. I don’t know to what extent they’re allowed to go to in terms of protesting but they need to be BIGGER and LONGER (much easier said than done). At this point, I really don’t think many students are complaining to the admin and are more so upset at the workers. This tactic of trying to get the students to complain to the admin has failed multiple times. Like I said, I don’t know WHAT they would need to do but they need to go beyond just minor inconveniences that the UC can easily tip toe around and then everything goes back to normal after. As a student I hate to say this because I really don’t like the minor inconveniences the strikes cause (but I suck it up because as I said they’re MINOR and I can grow a pair to deal with it) but they need to majorly inconvenience the students. Given the workers positions in the hierarchy of UC, I don’t think they’re capable of something that drastic so I have doubts that they’ll ever get their demands met (which fucking sucks, they deserve to have their demands met) :/"

“Please join graduate and undergraduate students, children, teachers, faculty and staff, as well as the broader Santa Cruz community, to protest the privatization of childcare at UCSC.

As part of the new Student Housing West project, the administration intends to shut down the current university-run Early Education Services Preschool and Childcare and replace it with a new center run by a private, for-profit childcare provider, Bright Horizons. Against the will of the majority of student parents, demonstrated in a petition with over 250 signatures, the administration plans to finalize a contract with Bright Horizons at the UC Regents’ Meeting of March 13.  

Currently, at the university-run childcare center, costs range from $100 to $875 a month. At the new center, Bright Horizons will determine costs of childcare in accordance with market rates, which are $2000 to $3000 a month in Santa Cruz County. In fact, in addition to having no control over costs, UCSC will have no control over the quality of childcare, no control over teacher-to-student ratios, and no control over the availability of childcare spots for student-parents. Early education teachers at the current center will lose their unionized positions and will be asked to reapply with Bright Horizons, where they will receive lower pay and lose their union benefits.

Lack of quality and affordable childcare is a social justice issue; its absence denies access to education for women, trans parents, and students from wider ranges of income, which disproportionately affects people of color. The proposed shift to privatize childcare is just one instance of a broader move by the university administration to a corporate model, which will make services unavailable and inaccessible to the graduate student community, and the wider Santa Cruz community.”"

I am a 2007 UCSC grad that likes to lurk on this sub.  I’ve been wanting to post this for a while, but it’s mainly for my own curiosity (based on a few of the posts I’ve read here).

It’s been 12 years since I left Santa Cruz and I would love to know how different it is now.  I was a Cowell affiliate that lived in a quad my freshmen year (Parrington).  Other than a triple directly below us, all other rooms were doubles and singles. Are all the doubles now triples?!

My second year, I lived in the Cowell apartments. This was amazing since it was the first year they were open.  We lived in what was designated as an RA apartment (aka RA lived with us) for a total of 7 people. I can’t remember the apartment number but we were a corner unit, the front door was on the second floor and my bedroom window faced Hager.  The first floor had the living area, kitchen, a single, double and a shared bathroom. Upstairs were four single bedrooms and 2 bathrooms (shared by 2 girls each). Are they jamming even move people in these now? Our RA was actually kicked off campus the week prior to school starting, so we barely even lived with her...and the room stayed open and empty for an entire quarter before a random girl moved in.

My last two years I lived off campus near Delaware. Junior year was a 5 bed, 2 bath house with 5 girls living there. I paid $550 for a single and shared a bathroom with one other person. Senior year was a 4 bedroom, 2 bath with 4 girls. I paid $850 (which felt insane at the time) for my own room and shared a bathroom with 2 girls.  These prices seem impossible and too low now.

I see that a lot of you post about going to a second tier school, or worse, and don’t love UCSC. I absolutely loved my time there, wanted to be there and I know I probably had it easier with housing. My college boyfriend hated UCSC to the point of transferring to UCI. My other best friend transferred to UCD. I stayed and graduated with a Legal Studies major during the Great Recession. I really thought I wanted to go to law school, took a year off to study for the LSAT and I worked for a law firm.  While working at the law firm, I realized there was no way I was willing to accrue more debt for something I would resent. 

I fell in to tech sales in 2010, stayed in the industry until 2016 and am finally, maybe, sort of using my degree now. I am still in sales, but in the legal services industry.  My clients are attorneys and paralegals. I make more than 80% of my clients. That is not a humble brag; it’s a fact. Is the legal studies major still was wildly unpopular as it was in 2007? 

Good luck with your finals and whatever CE12 is...."

I look around me and this isn't even the Crown dining hall that I remember. The Crown DH that I remember had geeks and even a tad bit of diversity. Now, I look around me and all I see are white people.... The genetic makeup has somehow grown even whiter, taller, and more athletic than once before. You know, change is scary, especially when it happens so suddenly. I don't even see geeks anymore because most of them have gone into hiding. And I can't blame them. These Cowell/Stevenson have not even bothered to learn the culture and barely speak the language. They like to say ""dude"" and ""bro"" a lot and in the past few days, I've heard them criticizing our precious dining hall and asking all these questions about why we are the way we are. They just don't get it because they've been so accustomed to their late night and precious weekend services, but finally it is ours. I hope that if these refugees must stay, they continue to feel the inconvenience of hiking up Mount Cardiac for food. Let them suffer.

I have a proposal.... I believe that we should build a wall around Crown and Merrill. Everyday I wake up and when I go to eat breakfast, all I can ask is ""Where Has My Dining Hall Gone?"".

UCSC purposely reduces parking spots and gives out few parking passes so students will park in spots where they are not allowed to. Top that off with reducing bus frequency on campus, it makes it that much more difficult to get around an already very hilly campus, making you want to use your car even *more.* [Cal Poly slo gets 38% of the profits brought in by parking fines.](http://mustangnews.net/where-does-all-that-parking-money-go/) I can’t say what it’s like for UCSC, but I doubt it’s much different.

UCSC has enrolled in a campus-wide site license which grants unlimited access to MATLAB and all of its toolboxes.
&gt;
&gt;One of the immediate impacts of this update is that we are no longer limited to a specific number of seats for toolboxes.  A number of research groups at BSOE have a small number of seats for certain toolboxes and thus were not able to run them on as many systems as they wished.  These toolboxes can now be run on multiple systems without risking license issues.
&gt;
&gt;The MATLAB installation that BSOE maintains in the /bsoe/software NFS directory has been updated to R2019a.  This installation has every toolbox, so the newly-available toolboxes can all be used now.  Installations on individual systems have not yet been updated and we do not have an ETA for when that work will begin (note that this refers to supported systems, not unsupported or personally-owned systems).

&gt;Installation on personal systems is coming, but there is still some work to be done before users will be able to download and install MATLAB directly from Mathworks.  We have been offering self-serve installation packages for some time and those installations will continue to work, but the installer packages we distributed do not contain any toolboxes that weren't provided with our earlier network license and they will need to be updated before the new toolboxes can be used.  Going forward, self-serve installations will be performed through Mathworks' own web site.
&gt;
&gt;Please do not open help tickets about installation on personal systems at this time.  This announcement is only about the BSOE network license.  Additional information about the self-service option will be made available as soon as the Mathworks portal is ready for end users."

Why doesn't my pet turtle eat the kale chips I give to it?

Well, here is my solution. We need an event by the students, for the students.
I call it the UCSC Chicken Nuggets initiative.
In SUA this year, there was a total spending budget of $48,000 for SOFA which is specifically used to fund various organizations, and a total of $37,700 in its general operating budget.
If we combine these 2 numbers, we get $85,700 of total spending for SUA.
So what if we decided to use this money for the people it's meant to benefit?
McDonald's currently sells chicken nuggets at a rate of $5 for 20 nuggets this means that for every $1 we spend we can get approximately 4 nuggets.
If we spend a total of $85,700 for chicken nuggets we will get approximately 342,800 nuggets
now there are around 20,000 students at UCSC so that means by using the entire SUA spending budget we can get roughly ~17.14 which is about 17 nuggets per student assuming each and every student collects their nuggets. I want my 17 nuggets and frankly everyone should. you can sign the petition here at bit.ly/NuggetsInitiative "

I voted no on 72 because CAPS was legitimately never there for me any time I attempted to use on-campus services. I know I'm in the minority here so I'm not going to be surprised by the downvotes I'll get by saying this, but I've barely benefitted from any on-campus services.        

CAPS was booked for weeks when I needed to talk with someone after my friend died so they referred me to an off-campus therapist who was also booked. Undergraduate advising fucked up my schedule and my 4-year degree magically turned into 5 years (I know 2 other friends who received poor quality information from counselors too). The student health center misdiagnosed my pneumonia as a cold, and then told me I just had a flu when I got pneumonia AGAIN (even after I mentioned how the symptoms felt very similar to the bout of pneumonia I had a few months prior). OPERS is packed 24/7 and it's way too small for the number of students it should be supporting.      

So what now? I go to Kaiser whenever I'm sick, I got a membership to 24 Hour Fitness, and if I ever have an urgent mental health situation I'm just going to suck it up and drink a handle. I'm paying thousands every year for my funds to be mismanaged by the administration (and for MATLAB) and I have such a jaded perspective on school resources after 3 years that I no longer utilize any of them. Am I unlucky/an asshole or are my feelings about this valid?"

This is very reasonable as caffeine does have some great benefits that assist with studying, such as increased alertness and enhanced cognitive functions. However, they also come with some really shit side effects, too, like heart palpitations, frequent need to urinate, indigestion, CONSTIPATION, and DIARRHEA. 

If you are an avid caffeine drinker and experience any problems in the bathroom (loud, long, or painful shitting &amp; bloating), a special tip that may work for you is DRINKING WATER! (:

Many of you are dehydrated and if you have a problem admitting that it's okay you don't have to. Just drink lots of water (enough to be hydrated, idk everyones different) and you'll feel a difference ( I can honestly guarantee it). Might even lose a pimple or two.

I spent weeks getting a group together for apartments just to be rejected for the early selection period. Ok I thought, it's fine, we will wait for the normal housing period and it will be fine. 

So the day comes around for our groups earliest housing period. There are no empty apartments. The first three people in my group find a spot just fine. Ok it's fine, I thought I can wait for our next earliest period just an hour later and get a room just fine. The time comes, we find three spots open in an apartment and then I'm hit with a message in big red text.

Students rooming together have to share the same gender. 

I cant room with the exact same roomate I have now because at some point I marked my gender unreported. The housing system takes this to mean I'm nonbinary and so can only be housed with other nonbinary students. By the time of my application period all rooms for student housing are gone. I'm sure I'm not the first person to get shafted by the on campus housing system but now I know how it feels. This is fucking dumb 

It also raises so many questions. If I was actually a nonbinary student I would've just lost my housing because of my gender identity. That seems an awful lot like discrimination based on gender. If there are five different options for gender and unreported is one of them, why group that in with nonbinary students? If they are so concerned about students of different gender rooming together wouldnt it mean that anyone who is unreported gender can room together, despite their actually gender?

From: Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp and Dean Alexander Wolf

Subject: Campus investigating allegations of misconduct

---

Recently, serious and troubling allegations of misconduct against a professor in the Baskin School of Engineering have resurfaced online. The allegations include sexual harassment, discrimination based on race, gender, and religion, and more. These allegations are being investigated. The professor is currently on leave.

When UC Santa Cruz first became aware of such allegations, we alerted the appropriate campus offices for follow-up and investigation, including the Title IX Office and the Academic Personnel Office.

We understand our community’s alarm that our silence on this matter signals tolerance. This is simply untrue.

The safety and well-being of our students is our highest priority, and we treat allegations of misconduct by anyone—faculty, staff, or students—with seriousness and care. In most instances, there is also very little we can say publicly, because of the privacy rights afforded to all parties, to protect the integrity of our investigation, and to protect the due process rights of all involved.

We strive to foster a welcoming and inclusive community for everyone, yet recognize there are times when more work, including corrective measures, is needed. Anyone who has faced discrimination or harassment is encouraged to report such conduct.

---

Did anyone feel like this email really didn't address any of the issues that have been raised? It says that an investigation is being carried out but doesn't address the complaint that the investigation has been delayed and incompetent which is what prompted the first petition back in February as well as the followup chatter more recently."

One too many times a student shoves me with their bag as they are pushing through the bus and I am nearly knocked down.

I will no longer stand being pummeled by backpacks on the bus. How are you so unaware of the large thing on your back?? I'm sure it has some weight to it, do you not account for it in your movements?? This happens in tight lecture halls as well.

1. UCSC is a great place for people who are self driven to pursue opportunities. If you see a need for something build it, create the change you want to see, etc. Since this school isn't mindlessly competitive there's a rare opportunity for people with creativity and drive to truly shine. 

2. Rainboots/waterproof shoes on campus are an amazing investment. Some people don't see the need but I say try it if you have the means to and watch your quality of life improve 

3. Please take advantage of on campus resources such as food pantries, internships, advising, etc. Yes sometimes these things can be inadequate, but there are often opportunities and resources that are under utilized too. A lot of campus resources aren't properly advertised, if you need help, please post on Reddit or FB and people will try to direct you to relevant resources. 

4. Might be obvious but most people get off of the buses at East remote, science hill, and Porter. If you want a seat on the bus, your best bet is to walk to one of those locations if you can and get on there.

5. For the love of blumie, please wear flip flops in the dorm bathrooms and showers

 I truly put work into this class, and worked with the TA, and still could not pull through quite enough on the final. is it legal for a professor to auto-fail based on a finaltest grade when I still had an A in the class until then? How would I go about contesting this? it dropped my GPA from a 3.7 to a 3.1. I have never failed a class before and I'm unsure what to do because I feel it was unfair; the final had little to do with review, the TA's were told they couldn't do reviews with us etc. It was ridiculous.

These are just some google results. Inspect property closely. Know that outlets in bathrooms or kitchens should have GFCI (the little circuit breaker buttons) and the rest of the house should have grounded outlets (three holes). This should be standard regardless of the building's age.

Look for wood rot and mold. Even if it only seems like exterior trim is rotting it likely means there is something lurking under the surface. Weird smells (that aren't new paint or bleach) are a bad sign. Mold, even though it is damp in Santa Cruz, should be taken care of before renting or showing the property. Beware converted garages (sometimes there is no insulation), ramshackle in-law units, and places where there is no real kitchen or bathroom (there is a place in Scotts Valley with a hot plate, microwave, and mini-fridge for a kitchen).

If need be figure out how to couch surf for a few weeks before signing a lease for a property that poses a risk to your health.

I'm understanding of causes, but disagree with certain methods. In this case  I thought this trivialized the seriousness and movement which they said to have protested for. Focus on one cause, and stick with it. Tuition hikes, Police Brutality  and Black Lives Matter?.. Might as well throw rent control, our opioid problem, homelessness, white supremacy, or anything else that would further water down whatever issues they wanted to bring acknowledgement towards.

**Every year there are different protests/picket lines** that consists of both entrances to the campus being blocked by students whiles classes were still in session. My experience: I get off the bus with my bike from base of campus and ride up, protesters won't negotiate/budge. There seem to be a lot of tension in the air or some sort of preparedness for exchanges of words as if that's what has been going on all day.. It was hot and sweaty, quiet, and a lot of them looked tired and fatigue. I tell them to stay hydrated as I ride off and took the dirt road on my bike to get to class (more longer and tiring). I made it to class, out of breath and met with classmates who conveniently live on campus to get to class. As I ride off they a handful of them said thank you collectively in appreciation upon reminding them to stay hydrated. While I was there another guy insisted on getting through the linked-arm picket line.. they wouldn't budge. So he broke his way through and manage to disconnect the armed linkage between protesters and kept on his business while student protesters were shouting and berating him.

Guaranteed a protest will happen, how you handle or engage is up to you. Funny thing is I don't know if anything ever changed or if these protests had any influences in any decision makings regarding what they were protesting for. I had a friend share with me that some girl was running amok up and down the dorms barbarically knocking on everybody's door including her door, waking her up to have her join in on their protests during dead week (week before finals). I'll leave it up to your imagination on how that 'conversation' went as well as how interactions between ""join me in this protest"" girl and students on her floor were for the rest of the year.

For some of you santa Cruz will be the place and for other's it wont. What I mean is for some of you this place will matter and for others no other place will ever matter on the same level as here. And honestly both are perfectly fine, if you get your education here and then move on to a good career and a happy life after santa Cruz fuck yeah good for you. For others if this town, this school shape the rest of your life that is also perfectly fine. Never let someone elses truth take away from what matters to you.

Ucsc and santa Cruz give you the gift of red woods and oceans, of mountain biking and surfing, of hard core computer science and amazing philosophy. As someone that has lived and loved Santa Cruz then left and came back the only ideas that you should fear or fight against are the ones that make you catigorize yourself. Be everything and nothing, honestly just do your best to be happy and burn everything else.

In my eyes this town and this school are an amazing gift in a world of hard borders and harder beleifs. The ucsc republicans might be an annoying group of trolls or freedom fighters for free speech; but the important thing is that in this place people get to decide not dogma no matter what it seems. This school, this town, this idea, face hard times right now, living here is fucking impossible, land owners are rich and lost, people are suffering, but here maybe more then anywhere else provides a chance to make things better. No matter what you believe never give up on the idea that together through arguments and name calling and bullshit, people, all people working togethe can make life I little but better then it was yesterday.

Santa Cruz isn't Berkeley and it never should be, from my personal favorite writer ""Now that you don't have to be perfect you can be good."" What I took from ucsc more then anything was be you the best you that you can ever be and if the world doesn't like tell them to get fucked.

Hope this wasn't to preachy, I just love this place/school and am trying to deal with the fact I might have to leave soon.

I love you slugs each and everyone of you and hope you find the happiness we are all looking for."

It collects a bunch of information about your computer, but privacy concerns aside, it's just annoying. You're required to install an antivirus program from an approved list, which is pretty short, and doesn't include Windows Defender. 

You can avoid using Safeconnect pretty easily, and I strongly recommend it:

* install a user agent switcher extension in your browser (like [this one](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-switcher-revived/) for Firefox or [this one](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-agent-switcher/dbclpoekepcmadpkeaelmhiheolhjflj?hl=en) for Chrome/Chromium derivatives).

* Connect to the resnet network, and when it asks you to login/check compliance, click the extension button and use it to change your user agent to ""Firefox on Ubuntu"". This ""tricks"" the webpage into thinking you're running Ubuntu, which they don't distribute Safeconnect for. Therefore, it lets you login without the safeconnect/antivirus check. You can force it to redirect you to the login page by navigating to a website that doesn't use SSL, like [neverssl.com](http://neverssl.com).

* refresh the page and login with your UCSC credentials. 

* once logged in, change your user agent back to default. 

* browse the internet as normal, and use whatever antivirus setup you please."

With that in mind however we don't want to provide people with things that they don't truly need.

If you are a homeless student or know someone who is please respond to this post with things that would be a big help during the school year. If you are also insecure about your situation or your friend is, please feel free to reach out to us on our instagram: @me2u\_project, twitter: @me2u\_project, or via email: [the.me2u.project@gmail.com](mailto:the.me2u.project@gmail.com) .

I've made a post willing to offer help/answer questions in the past which some people found useful, and now that school at started again I figured I'd post once more! Although since I graduated 3 years ago I'm now getting a bit distant from UCSC. 

**Frequently Asked Questions**

* What was your GPA/MCAT? - 3.85 and a 35 (~517 on new exam)
* Where do I get clinical experience in Santa Cruz? - Dominican hospital and Sutter take volunteers (I'm sure others do too), but it can be hard to get a spot. Consider EMT, scribe work, or medical assistant work. Salinas isn't too far south, and if you're willing to go over the hill San Jose may offer opportunities. Other volunteering activities may satisfy your clinical exposure/experience needs as well!
* Does my major matter to med schools? - No it does not. You do not need a science major (about 40% of med students were non-science majors). The perceived difficulty of your major is also meaningless (high GPA with easy major beats lower GPA with a ""hard"" major every time)
* How hard is it to stay in California for med school? - Very hard. We send about 2/3rds of our medical students out of state. There are very few CA spots compared to CA applicants. But other states are cool too!
* Physics series 6 or series 5? - I took series 6 since 5 is reported to be harder due to the higher math burden. So take the easier series! If these have changed since I graduate I apologize. 
* Is 2 quarters of general chem lab enough to satisfy the ""1 year"" requirement of medical schools? - The answer the generally that if your undergrad considers it a year then it is. At UCSC the general chem year long series is 3 lectures and 2 labs so it does count. Again I apologize if UCSC has changed since I left.

I get it. You’re in your dorm when your body decides to be a sneaky lil shit and send a giant Nova Bomb barreling down your back end. You rush to bathroom, desperate for any sense of relief. But some of the stalls are locked! You’ve got to find that one stall that’s open!

We’ve all been there. It sucks. But please, for the love of the Traveler’s Light, do not POUND on the stall doors! 

What you SHOULD do is gently push on them with a single finger. Even the slightest touch will tell you if the stall is locked. I do it all the time. Be sneaky. Like, Hunter sneaky.

What you SHOULD NOT do is shoulder charge that stall door like a Cursed Thrall, violently shaking it in its lock and about giving me a heart attack while I’m trying to piss.

College is hard. Sometimes you don’t make friends fast enough, maybe you learned your major actually isn’t for you, maybe you failed a class or a few, maybe you’re feeling like coming here was a bad idea. I went through all of these things and still am going through some of them. I have depression and anxiety and went through some of the worse depressive episodes my first two years here. I stayed in my room and slept all day, I wouldn’t eat, shower, or brush my teeth. I was confused, I had worked so hard to get here and I really wanted to be here but now that I was, I was having one of the toughest times of my life. I failed some classes, I had issues with financial aid, I was having a hard time finding friends, and I didn’t know what I wanted to major in anymore. I felt lost and hopeless. I got this far and was ready to give up and go home. Last year I had to leave campus, it was involuntary but for the better. I had issues with financial aid and lost my housing. I was gone for two quarters and it gave me time to think about everything and figure out what I wanted, and that I needed help. I missed school, so I took some classes at a cc during the summer to show UCSC I was ready to return and do better. I was readmitted (when I left I wasn’t in good academic standing). I started taking my meds, I started eating better and gained some weight, I figured out what I wanted to major in after taking a sociology course during my time away. I’m still working on coming out of my shell and making friends, I’m still working on my GPA, I’m making sure I eat the way I should, and getting academic and medical help when I need it. Sometimes you need a break, sometimes you have to ask for help and that’s okay. I realized people would kill to be at UCSC and that I worked so hard to be here and didn’t want to waste it. If you’re going through anything like this, I just wanted to say that everything will turn out fine. Trust and take care of yourself. Take time off if you need it, don’t be ashamed to ask for help, and don’t be so hard on yourself. Everyone doesn’t have it together like you might think, and no one comes to college knowing exactly what they want, no one is expecting you to either. I hope you find your way soon. College isn’t as bad as it seems, it’s hard, but you’ll get there. I’m here for you if you need someone because I was that someone."

The only other options that I saw were frats, but, from what it looked like at OPERSFest/Cornucopia, the frats seemed to consist exclusively of muscle bros who were exclusively pulling other muscle bros from the crowd. As a skinny nerd, intimated would be an understatement. I thought I’d do fine being on my own for a few weeks with my only socializing being my roommates and a few people my floor. I was wrong. So...now what?"

So put 2 and 2 together I don't have access to any website with a login. On top of that I was too naive to do the recommended two device setup.

Well... easy fix right? Just contact the IT services and get a password list: I tried but it seems they're closed on the weekends and I need the login by this Sunday. 

How about going on the website and getting an MFA token? If I want to submit a ticket for help or even get a token you need the MFA authentication which I don't have. Just a full circle.

I would be grateful for any advice on this situation

I have a character planned out, a Priest, and my boyfriend is undetermined (but probably will be a Bard). It'll be my second ever campaign, and my boyfriend's fourth... so you'll have to be a little patient with me.

He and I aren't chaotic-stupid joykills, but I can be a little eccentric and silly. He's usually a lot more productive but is also pretty silly. (and we aren't gross together)

I am here all alone, my family is 2,000 miles away and offers absolutely no support, CAPs is garbage, financial aid sends me into a panic attack every summer, I really cannot take it any more here. I’m taking extra classes to graduate a year early, I can’t fucking imagine having to stay here all 4 years.

Now, while I live with my husband and that is two incomes, many grad students I know here in Alberta live only with the funding money the university gives us (around 1k a month), it's not *comfortable* but it's doable.

ejthtv,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/ejthtv/email_update_on_grading_strike_1320/,"Email update on grading strike, 1/3/20",26,74,2020-01-03 23:20:21,"""We are sending this email because some of you have received emails  from your academic advisors that lack certain information that we want  you to have. 

Since the beginning of our grading strike, the  administration has repeatedly refused to meet with us. Instead of  resolving this issue, they are hoping to break our strike by sewing  confusion and fear amongst undergraduate students and faculty. 

 It is not our intention to hurt undergraduate students. The university  administration will do everything to pit undergraduates against graduate  students—to drive a wedge of anger and confusion through our  solidarity. We cannot allow this to happen! The university that doesn’t  pay graduate students enough to live here is the same university that  shackles you in student debt. The university makes its profits off of  your student loans and our unjust wages.

UCSC, which calls itself  a public university, charges you exorbitantly high tuition, which most  of you can only meet by taking on huge amounts of student debt with high  interest rates. Your tuition is rising and your debt is rising, while  the product you are indebted for—your education—is decreasing in  quality. Your learning conditions are our working conditions. Your TAs  cannot adequately do the work we do if the university refuses to pay us  enough to live here. In short: your struggle and our struggle are the  same.

Graduate students, faculty and staff across UCSC have taken  measures to mitigate the potential negative impacts of the strike to  undergraduates. These measures include:

1) No students will be  disqualified or barred from enrolling next quarter as a result of  missing grades. Graduate student strikers received the following message  from college provosts: “After much consideration, the Council of  Provosts, which oversees Academic Standing Review, has decided to waive  academic review for Fall 2019. This means that students will not be  reviewed or subject to barment this quarter and thus, we do not need TAs  to inform us of student grades.”

2) No students will be dropped  from or barred from enrolling in courses due to a missing grade in a  prerequisite taken in Fall 2019. According to the FAQ published by UCSC  Public Affairs, “Students with missing grades will not be dropped from  future courses that require completion of the course as a prerequisite.  Satisfaction of prerequisite courses is not verified until after a final  grade has been assigned.”

Although students will not be dropped  due to missing grades in a prerequisite course, if you failed the  prerequisite, you will be dropped from the next course in the sequence  once this failing grade is submitted. We don't want any students to be  surprised by being dropped after the quarter starts due to receiving a  failing grade. If you are concerned that you may have failed the course  you took with me in the Fall, please contact me. If you fill out and  email me a FERPA waiver (attached to this email with instructions  provided on [payusmoreucsc.com](http://payusmoreucsc.com/) website; click here to read them), I will then be able to email you your grade directly.

 3) For students in extenuating circumstances (e.g. financial aid  probation, graduating and urgently need their graduation processed),  striking graduate students have offered to submit individual grades at  the students’ request. Students do not need to disclose their reason for  needing their grades urgently in order to have their grades submitted –  we have advised striking grads to submit grades for any student who  says they need their grade urgently, no questions asked. The Office of  the Registrar has made a process available for submitting partial grade  rosters, so these students will have their grades officially processed,  and will not suffer any consequences as a result of the strike. This  process is outlined in an email sent out to instructors by the Registrar  and also on the COLA campaign website ([https://payusmoreucsc.com/](https://payusmoreucsc.com/)).

I don’t hate it, but I’m not totally happy with it. But I took Film 80S last spring and loved it. It made me want to take more film classes.

I’ve been thinking about a film minor for a while, and it seems that I would need to start this quarter to make it possible. The film and digital media department told me the first steps, but I (regrettably) put off looking into the program until the last minute and I’m not totally sure what I’m getting into or if I should do it at all.

Could any film students share some of their thoughts on the program here? Is 80S a good example of what the program is like? Would the work load be too much to handle on top of CS (it would be one film class and two CS classes most quarters)? Is it worth it?

And finally, I’m not really sure how a minor works here. Will I be able to drop it if it doesn’t work out?

My current plan see if I can talk to an advisor on Monday before the first 20C class happens.

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you!"

If we have solidarity, we are in agreement, our opinions and well-being are respected, and we have the right to refuse to participate.

#  Would strikers be willing to release student grades to any student who asks, simply because the student no longer wishes to have their grades involved in the strike? If the majority of the students are in solidarity, then this won't affect the strike too much, because most students' grades will still be missing right? 

Because if you're afraid to let us walk out, then this isn't solidarity. This is pretty much just a crappy hostage situation, and your paper promises of ""solidarity"", ""protection"", and ""care"" are there to placate us like children. If it actually turns out that the majority of the students want their grades back and don't want to be part of your strike, then can you still claim solidarity?

 I'm curious what your answer will be. (How might we interpret silence? Special shout-out to strike representative u/ladut so this is seen.) I can't tell what ""strike theory"", placating response we'll get next.  Or maybe we won't get an answer at all, despite the strikers' emphasis on how *they're* not to blame for any communication breakdowns regarding grades. Maybe they just can't risk any situation that could result in definite proof that the majority of students don't want to be part of the strike.

**If I'm just the salty loud minority, then let my grades go. Let the small crowd of ""scabby"", complaining students just get their grades back. They'll retreat to the distance and stop complaining right? It'll be a win-win for all of us. You'll have definite proof that the majority of the students are firmly in solidarity with you all, and you can silence all the non-supportive students by giving their grades back.**"

Similarly, if I asked a prospective professor, ""What are your near-term or long-term goals,"" I would expect better than an answer of, ""I want to keep breathing.""  Such an answer states the bare minimum and does not indicate any understanding of the multi-faceted aspects of teaching in a diverse state school. 

Diversity and equity are complicated topics.  Fostering student success appropriately involves understanding many things about student situations, abilities, and environments. Similarly, an answer on the order of, ""I care about diversity cuz I are one"" would be rated low.  What are good answers?  There are an unbounded range of them. People can talk about what they have done to make DRC students feel welcomed in class, or how they care about fostering a growth mindset (proven to increase performance in underrepresented groups), or how they like find student-backgrounds to color their willingness to ask for help.  Frankly, the hoops that budding academics have to jump through to show they can pitch their work for publication, funding, and education are way more onerous than this in many, many other areas, and I think someone who can't answer the question of how they support diversity--especially in an engineering discipline--doesn't deserve to teach here.  I don't care how great their navel-gazing is.

Interestingly, for our search, every candidate I talked to was delighted that we were placing an emphasis on diversity--regardless of whether or not they were a member of any recognizable underrepresented group.  A couple of the candidates told us that the statement of that requirement in the job ad--along with UCSC's high rating for social mobility--is what made them want to apply to our school. (These were great candidates, and I would be proud to have them as colleagues.)"

GROW 👏🏽 UP 👏🏽,13,127,2020-02-10 14:37:46,"Cost of living adjustment. Sure. I was in support of the cause and I understand that this is something people feel they deserve. I supported you in that but not anymore. 

Just talked to a friend who was super upset because strikers surrounded his car, yelled and cursed at him to not cross the picket line, and refused to let him pass onto campus. He had his small children in his car with him, who are now very scared and low key traumatized. Even after strikers could see the kids and he told them he had kids in the car, that he lives in FSH on campus and wants to get them home - strikers still cursed and yelled and wouldn’t let him go. 

I also live in FSH. My kid’s safety and education (driving them to and school off campus) is significantly more important to me than your COLA. Your cola could have been important to me if you didn’t think it was okay to treat FSH families like this. I get that this is not representative of the movement as a whole but it only takes a few out of control strikers to do damage. 

Grow up. Children are children and don’t deserve your crap. Any person who thinks their cause is worth traumatizing children needs to seriously reevaluate their behavior. To do this to children is unacceptable, immature and hurtful. 

That is why I don’t support you anymore. Because you clearly think something like this is okay. 

That is all. Gonna study for my midterms, get good grades, and live my life."

To start - test taking is vulnerable. You're likely hunched over, deeply focused and searching your brain for a small detail from a lecture two weeks ago. The interference was all about power. They knew it was a test, and they came in to surround us and yell at us. 

When that many people storm into your classroom, it induces a fight or flight response. It didn't feel safe. By the time all of them were in the room, I felt a little shaky. People tried to yell back at them at first, but after a minute most people realized that we didn't have any power, so we kept working on the test. I had to redo the same problem 3 times because I couldn't focus on it. (anyone in 102 knows missing one box in that coin-change table could mess the whole problem up).

Also, many of the protesters were filming. (Maybe one in five? Hard to say, looking back). And most of them were smiling, some laughing. We were being filmed without our consent. There was no intention to recruit us for the strike. We were being talked down to, scolded, and laughed at. I know there's a lot more footage out there, I hope it will incriminate them.

In the end, after they left, I noticed that one of the students was crying and had to leave the room. (Completely understandable, it really sucked to be trapped and yelled at). The protesters were yelling at us for 10 minutes about how we lack empathy, but ironically they lacked it themselves. I was able to finish the test and feel good about it, but for anyone who had test anxiety, was affected by being yelled at, or didn't feel as confident... it was probably a lot worse. 

Don't downplay what happened. If you know one of the protesters, report them for disturbing the peace. I hope they all get arrested."

What I want to say is there are always people in a protest who “cross the line” and hurt innocent people who supports them. Hell, even the Civil Right movement have the Black Power counter part. And for you who think other protest you supports doesn’t have extremist like the COLA strikers, think this way. If anything about this store goes famous in Reddit it will be police arresting strikers instead of striker harassing commoners, and I bet the top comment will be people hating on the admission and giving strikers support, and anyone dare to show the other side of the strike will not get enough attention. If you are just an outsider looking at those posts, guess what will your reaction be?

However, I’m definitely not asking anyone to change their mind on the issue, but instead trying use this as a chance to show you guys the more complicated problem of protesting."

I'm a 2017 grad - I have experienced and saw year after year how rent has increased while the lack of available rental has decreased. But I've also done my research about the Bay Area housing crisis and have taken measures for this-- working 2-3 jobs at a time, living in doubles or triples. I understand how this may not be feasible for those who come to UCSC as a grad student with family  and dependents, but common, how could you not have researched what a shit hole for living costs it is here?? And even if this is the only school that accepted you, you have every opportunity to decline admission and try again for a program in an area that you can afford, or at least give you a stipend that you need. 

After UCSC, I've entered medical school where tuition costs 50k a year + living expenses. None of it is paid for and UC grads get free tuition ANNND a stipend. I dedicate so much of my time on campus doing research, school, TA-ing, and still find time to work for what my loans can't cover. Literally in every single graduate degree minus a PhD, we have to pay full tuition!!??!??! 

From just observing how everything is playing out, I'm shocked at how grads can twist this narrative to involve telling undergrads to support, yet fucking them over in every way possible.. 2-3 weeks of canceled classes are literally thousands of dollars. interrupting a midterm with blatant disregard to students who upholds their education was stupid, reckless, and incredibly disrespectful. Not even going to touch on how the response letter was obviously a half ass apology, ending with ' lol u should still support us we didn't mean it'. It becomes clearer each day how much this movement is derailing and spiraling.

I’ve been consistently going to the strikes and emailing my TAs and professors to show my solidarity on COLA. I’m going to give you a very simple reason why. Because I support in doing the right thing….whatever fault you find in any statement, you cannot ignore the virtue or purpose of what's behind it; and the virtue in this case is that we are literally trying to make hundreds of TA’s living situation better. Getting this COLA directly impacts the quality of education us undergrads gets, and I would never ask them to educate me while living in circumstances of financial precarity, housing insecurity, and food instability.

That being said, I went to the march yesterday and I want to share what happened.

COLA marchers posted around the SNE court/quarry to listen to a beautiful well-said speech about the history of UCSC student’s fight against a system that feeds off the burdened. As we ended that rally, we were getting to continue the march when I noticed the group split into two: one group for going into a classroom and the other to continue the march. I decided to choose the latter because personally I did not believe that disrupting a classroom would be effective, as students in classrooms have already invested in going to class and they weren’t simply going to leave. We could gather more support from bystanders/colleges out on the street than people who crossed the picket line.

Now, I have no quarrel with people in CSE 102, and I totally understand where you are coming from. But please, stop acting like this march CAUSED you to fail. Tantalo gave you an EXTRA 30 mins (you’re welcome) and if you failed that probably means you didn’t study enough. I’d like to also point out that that midterm is super fucking minuscule in the grand scheme of things. VERY VERY MINISCULE. Why are you so caught up on something you’re probably going to forget in the near future? Let me ask you this, is a conglomerate, tech, oil-funded corporate going to ask you in an interview how you did in a CSE 102 midterm thats worth only 20%? No 

And if you are “annoyed by the inconvenience” then why don’t you show some solidarity so we can get a goddamn COLA sooner and return to regular school schedules because NEWS FLASH, WE ARE ALL ANNOYED."

I attended as many of the pickets as I could, including Doomsday 1.0 (I couldn't make it to 2.0). I have done everything I possibly could to demonstrate solidarity and provide support to the striking students. 

I have also approved of every major tactic utilized by the strikers, with a few notable exceptions I will discuss later. While I don't think one needs to be radical to support civil disobedience, my political views all align well with a redistribution of surplus budget towards paying UC workers more, including graduate student TAs. Of course, the best possible option for achieving this goal is to build a coalition UC-wide large enough to deny any unacceptable union agreements. However, considering the past vote and the strikers' claims of being in crisis, I feel safe admitting that withholding labor is the next best thing. What has been effective about the strike so far, in my opinion, is its streamlined purpose - for the most part the strike has remained focused intently on COLA. After police intimidation on the part of the UC, some anti-police rhetoric entered the general strike corpus, but I can forgive that as a response rather than a lack of focus. 

There are two specific actions that I condemn outright: the withholding of some students' grades even upon request and the interruption of the CSE 102 midterm. The force of this strike should be to minimize pressure on undergraduates and maximize pressure on the UC. There's always going to be collateral damage in a movement like this, but aside from these two events (which place immense pressure on vulnerable undergraduates with little to no pressure on the UC) I think the campaign has handled itself fairly well in this respect. I believe both of these circumstances were a direct result of the COLA campaign's free-form, ""democratic"" structure, not its message or intent, so I only assign partial blame to the campaign. However, after these events it would be best for the movement to tighten its plan and guidelines some to prevent something like these from happening again. 

The campaign has made it clear here and elsewhere that grades will be returned upon request, and the times I've seen a response to a TA's refusal the campaign leadership has promised to look into it. Considering the leader of the midterm group has been identified as an undergraduate, I also believe that the campaign did not intend for this specific event to take place. 

That being said, I assign full blame to campaign leadership for their ""apology."" They should be doing everything they can to both distance themselves from and condemn the midterm disruptors. This strike will accomplish nothing if it loses its momentum. While the statewide solidarity and action on other campuses is a good sign for this momentum, a movement dependent on large-scale action to put pressure on an employer as large as the UC simply MUST protect its optics. UCSC is at the heart of the COLA strike, and we need to set an example for other campuses. It would be a huge mistake to remain indifferent on the event that took place yesterday. That mistake is antithetical to the cause, and could have far-reaching negative effects on the state-wide movement. Be careful: the world is watching.

TL;DR: Strike leadership publicly disapproves of withholding grades from students who ask. They should also publicly condemn the midterm disruption and consider organizing more strictly to prevent bad optics and pointless harm to undergraduates."

Some cons are that it's an 8am, and this is the first year it's being taught so I couldn't find a syllabus for it. Pros are that it seems like a pretty interesting class, it's small, and it doesn't have section.

I'm going to email her and ask for the syllabus, but doubt that she has it done. If anyone has taken a class w/Verma before I'd love to hear what your experience was! One of the deciding factors in me taking this class would be the number of take-home writing assignments, especially because the other class I'm considering only has two assignments, both of which are fairly short.

The UC is responsible for the workers they employ and we have missed classes and sections and access to optimal learning conditions for TOO LONG, and it’s because of the UC’s negligence and failure to resolve the political unrest on our campus. We as undergrads paid up the ass for this “education” but as far as im concerned we aint getting it and we deserve compensation. I don’t know if any of yall have lawyer parents who are tryna start a **Class Action Lawsuit** against the UC so that we get at least a refund for the 3 weeks of classes now that have been disrupted.

Look at the mortality rate in Italy -- this is a result of overburdening the healthcare system. If you want to be careless and get sick, fine, you have a 5-20% chance to enter critical condition and require hospitalization. Since you are young, you will have high priority and likely get treatment. However, they will be kicking a grandmother off her ventilator to do that for you.

Sign up using your UCSC Email or use this link: [www.focusmate.com/signup/UCSantaCruz](http://www.focusmate.com/signup/UCSantaCruz)   


Please share this with your classmates, friends, &amp; teachers! 

  
**How it works:**   
First you commit to a 50 minute time slot, and you are matched with a focusmate. When the time comes you show up on time, briefly check in with your partner **over video chat**, leave your video on while you work quietly in tandem, and then briefly check in at the end to see how the session went.   
**Why Use it**   
I personally find focusmate useful for studying year round, but I think it will be critical for doing well on online courses next quarter.  

* Get the social accountability of a study buddy while maintaining safe distances 
* Keep a schedule and maintain momentum in these Weird Times
* Hold yourself accountable to study at specific times 
* Use social pressure to get up in the morning

They were paid, yet they did not work. Generally, if you choose to ""not work"" (if you know what I mean), you don't get paid by your employer during that time you do not work. Maybe the union gives you some money, but you don't earn wages hence don't get paid.

Why should people get paid for not working? (They are not sick, yet. They aren't having babies at the base of campus.) The only thing unfair is expecting to keep getting paid while not doing work for months on end."

g1288p,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/g1288p/my_final_thoughts_on_my_time_here_as_a_transfer/,My final thoughts on my time here as a transfer &amp; film major,57,28,2020-04-14 02:08:54,"Warning this is straight up gonna be a vent post on my time here regarding mainly the quality of education I received. I’m not trying to be a negative Nancy however there are things that need to be said. Its pretty long.

TLDR : I never felt more cheated and disappointed in my life on the education I’ve received. My classmates and friends I’ve made here are the best thing about sc. Should have done better in cc, not sure how it is for regular 4 year students but it ain’t it for transfers. 

I’m a transfer student came in Fall ‘17 as a film &amp; digital media major wanting to pursue production. Transferred from a community college in the sf Bay Area. I just finished my last quarter here so I have some thoughts I wanted to get off my chest. I don’t really how to begin this but overall my undergrad experience has sucked, straight up. 

On the social side of things that was amazing. Porter A was wild, my classmates were hella cool, met some amazing ass people, and people in general here were literally so nice. So no complaints other than imma miss you all. 

But on the educational side of things it paled in comparison. When I was looking at my options for film schools their production department was the most important factor in my decision process, followed by tuition and housing costs. LA and NYC had the best options, but because the privates and out of state were wayy too expensive for me and my gpa was barely over 3.0 in cc ucsc was my best option. One of those factors was how hard they gassed up their production program it was hella much. During the tours, and when they visited my cc, they gassed it up. Like Nicholas cage dropped by, we have Emmy winners, we have connections, we have such a competitive production program, we have the best industry standard equipment, we’re ranked top 10 again, etc. I was gassed ngl. And then I went here. 

They have several options to choose from if you’re film. My goal was to get into the production concentration and take the big narrative senior exit course. To get to that point students have to go through lower divs, a mandatory theory class, a specific production track, and a mix of theory and production electives before you can be considered for the big senior exits. 

My first quarter I had to take the entry level intro to film class which I already took at my cc, but UCSC said my cc curriculum didn’t meet their standards. Wasn’t bothered because I thought I was gonna learn something new. I didn’t. It was a nice refresher but honestly a waste. 

My next quarter I took the mandatory theory class which is your gateway drug for anything else in film and for whatever reason came once or twice a year in a mid size classroom so if you couldn’t get in you were fuuucked. That was by far the most bs class I had ever taken in my entire academic career, I’m sorry if you had a good experience but that shit was whack and I didn’t learn anything. My TA was a straight up clown and was the most pretentious prick I’ve ever had. Like if you weren’t art hoey enough she’d look down on you. Sis it’s not that deep, you yourself said withhold judgment on others you don’t see eye to eye with. 

I still had that positive mindset, because the electives I was taking weren’t necessarily bad but at the same time didn’t bring anything new to the table. I wanted some woke ass film class and that had yet to arrive. I still held out because I finally got to start the production classes and bruh that’s when shit went south. Again they started plugging the shit out of the production classes and the production senior exits so I was gassed and ready until I actually started. 

To put it simply, I had learned 170B already back in cc. Every mechanical/practical thing the professor taught was VIA YOUTUBE VIDEOS. But she said don’t focus on that focus on story. Btw the cameras were outdated, there was five of them and they were shared between 50 fucking students between two classes. I don’t have that schmonies for a camera of my own and we HAD to use those cameras. But all those practical shooting methods, the editing, the work flow, how to wrap up a cable, I had already learned. I don’t know how it is for regular four year students, like I’m sure if you’ve never touched a camera and never used an editing software above iMovie or windows movie maker this would be useful, but everyone in my classes been knew this stuff and had already been making work. 

From there on out every production class i've had was shit. They focused on story story and story, not that story is wrong, but it was repetitive. Like bruh this camera has a 2,000 page manual please teach me how to maximize this. They didn't teach us about studio B other than to turn on a light and wrap a chord. One professor called color grading hocus pocus, one professor didnt know how to auto save even though he said it was very important that we try to do it, but he gave up on figuring it out. We no access to actors, but we were told to find actors who werent friends because our friends cant act, we were told to think practical but also think big, be realistic but also make a huge production, dont focus on dialogue but focus on visuals but also tell a story with dialogue. I mean I did it and made it into the production concentration and got into the 196 senior exit narrative, but I came in with nothing new to the plate.  

At this point you might be saying well why isnt this kid making the most of it? Well I did the best I could actually. Made projects with friends, did some freelance work, taught myself how to be creative with all the applications available to us, and used the facilities to work on my own projects. Additionally I did a summer semester at usc for their program (praise financial aid). I was so shocked and broken because it was so good, and that was the slap in the face over how much ucsc had flexed. I learned so much, I was taught brand new ideas/concepts/methods, the professors taught from experience and over half were still working in the industry on real ass shit. They enjoyed it and wanted to pass on their knowledge. Was it perfect? No. It still had its problems but I found myself stressing on things related solely to what we were working on. The actors were provided, the productions were paid for bc they didnt want us to pay out of pocket, there was a camera for everyone, everything was up to date. I never put ucsc on par with usc, but ucsc tried to be some edgy version of them so hard. I made friends from other schools like ucla and nyu and their experiences were similar to usc.

I felt so cheated and I felt so bad for my friends back at ucsc, because some of them are struggling over just trying to get a decade old camera and a person to act when they should be thriving. 

And one other thing, ucsc does not prep at all for post grad. If you're lucky you might get a class to do that, or you might find out about a program that takes a year to complete to get an internship. Couldn't take advantage of those. My cc film professor brought in an exec from universal to talk about post grad, ucsc showed us a youtube tedtalk about luck lmfao. Usc just threw the fucking industry at us. 

By the start of my last quarter here I had 3 different interviews, two as paid internships for television production, one as entry level multimedia production. All three of them mentioned usc on my resume, not one talked about sc other than when I was gonna finish. One dude literally said how impressive that it was to have gone to usc and he was impressed on what I did there. I had a mix of emotions, anger and pity on myself. Like was sc really not it? 

I’m trying to think of where I started out and me leaving this school, everything I have learned came from another school, my friends, or self taught. There was two classes I actually learned something, a directing class and sound production class to which those professors were passionate and taught from experience. Im not even gonna bring up our messy theory classes, they suck. 

After i started my production courses my mindset changed, I wanted more I got it elsewhere instead of here. I've been pretty silent on this because I had few classmates who were venting about their production classes to eachother in the hall and got shat on by the art hoes. They were called ungrateful and bratty. Im not a fan of confrontation, but the art hoes were wrong. I am also not a fan of settling when you know there is so much better out there. This is an unstable industry we have chosen to make a lifestyle out of, the road ahead is going to be difficult an enduring to put it lightly. People take a dump on us all the time saying make it hobby and go trade school. Once I figured out how many opportunities and how much there is to do with film, I wasn't bothered by the naysayers anymore. But with a school that claims something that its not, failing to prep some of the most talented passionate people i've seen, there is a problem here that just fucks everyone up and adds more obstacles. Obviously its not the case for everyone and people have done well. I do hope what I faced isnt the norm and I just caught a bad two years. Maybe it's more suitable for regular 4 years instead of 2 year transfers. 

Anyways its been a good run, go slugs! May you have amazing post quarantine glow ups and thrive in whatever area you want to go into."

We could try to apply for on-campus housing (so we wouldn't have to pay if fall is remote) but that poses the significant risk of just having our housing app be rejected, and we would have no housing at all.

And now since I actually got here and started taking the classes there's been the whole blackouts thing in the fall, the strikes in the winter, and now the lockdown. On top of that in not a single of those quarters I have been able to join a class I was actually interested in because my major is impacted so the classes are full before I can even register.

We wanted to let you know that the campus has made a decision to delay fall 2020 enrollment. Originally scheduled for May 20, enrollment in fall will open June 17. We are working on setting up appointment times in MyUCSC, and you should be able to see these in MyUCSC by 5:00 PM, Wednesday, May 13. The fall Schedule of Classes should be available on Friday, June 5.

As a campus, we need the extra time to plan for the possibility that not all students may be able to safely return to campus this fall. To accommodate this, many lectures and seminars may need to be offered either fully-remote or with a remote option. Likewise, classes that are typically offered in person may be subject to social distancing or other alternative setups that may impact room use, attendance patterns, and more. The coming weeks will be a critical time for departments and divisions to review their curriculum needs, for the campus to determine the best -- and safest -- way possible to offer fall classes.   

Best wishes for your success and safety,

Tchad Sanger
University Registrar

Read the letter we sent to admin!,3,29,2020-05-19 14:20:22,"Those of you against the use of ProctorU, here's a chance to have your voice heard and make a difference. (and those of you who have been here since the Dhar debacle, hi)

&amp;#x200B;

**SEND YOUR TESTIMONY TO SUA**

 I've been in contact with SUA, here's some of the info I've received:

&gt;... the Academic Senate \[which occurred this last Friday\] was interested in hearing specific testimonies from as many students as possible, as professors and others are definitely interested.  
&gt;  
&gt;Academic Senate mentioned that while ProctorU is the approved testing service at the moment, with enough advocacy, it does not have to be. 

Student are encouraged to send testimonies to both [suapres@ucsc.edu](mailto:suapres@ucsc.edu) and  [suavpe@ucsc.edu](mailto:suavpe@ucsc.edu). If you have something to say, here's your chance!

Things to mention:

* Your specific/classwide negative experiences using ProctorU
   * for example, it took my proctors about 90 minutes to start my last exam, and I had to pay a fee to schedule a new appointment because they took so long)
   * for example, our professor couldn't release our scores on a multiple choice canvas exam for over a week because of issues with ProctorU 
* Your individual technology, WiFi, and home circumstances that have/could make ProctorU difficult to use
   * Do you rely on hotspots and tethering? ProctorU bans that. 
   * Do you have a chromebook? ProctorU bans that.
   * Does your home network receive a lot of traffic as a result of family working/learning from home? That compromises your connection.
   * Can you not afford a better device or network?
   * Do you not have total privacy/quiet to take tests and not get flagged as cheating?
   * Are you using a family computer and not have admin privileges or the ability to reserve it for hours at a time?
* Your specific privacy concerns with ProctorU (do you have your DACA files on your device?) However, *don't emphasize this one*. Accessibility is our best case. 

**Remember, you don't have to write much to make a huge difference!** Several of us have already shared our experiences with SUA - we encourage you to do the same!

&amp;#x200B;

**CONSIDER CONTACTING YOUR DEPARTMENT/FACULTY**

We sent a letter to the physics department chair, and after some back and forth, he told us that while he doesn't have the power to break the school's contract with ProctorU, he thinks our concerns are valid and has raised them to 'upper admin'.

I've also been working with one of my professors. She's been helping me navigate the school bureaucracy, spreading our messages and raising our concerns to other faculty and admin, speaking up at the Academic Senate and at faculty meetings, and just generally helping me figure out what to do. 

*Getting faculty support is vital* \- whether its professors or a department chair, it's definitely worth raising your issues and concerns to faculty to raise awareness, gain support, and amplify our voices. The letter we sent to our dep. chair was a near copy of the one we sent to admin, but yours can be far less detailed and lengthy, or even just a message to a professor asking if they're aware of this issue and what students can do to help. *The faculty generally wants to listen and improve things* \- remember that! If faculty is concerned about this, admin has to listen, and we have way more ethos.

&amp;#x200B;

**CONTACTING ADMIN**

We sent a letter to the administration about ProctorU - in it, we pick apart the issues with the privacy policy and raise accessibility concerns. It's full of a lot of info and it's pretty beefy - here it is! \[[LINK TO ADMIN LETTER](https://docdro.id/C8liRTY)\] 

I will update yall as soon as I get a response. If you have any questions about this or ideas about contacting admin, please comment!

&amp;#x200B;

**The Goal**

We're hoping to get the school to leave it's contract with ProctorU this coming fall quarter. To make this happen, we need your voices! Email SUA with your testimony! Reach out to your professors and departments! Inform your classmates!

Our goal is not just to contact Admin - we're trying to raise awareness on this issue, we're trying to gain faculty support, we're trying to amplify student voices. 

As a final note, our best case against ProctorU now seems to be accessibility. As it turns out, it's not actually that good of a service, and a lot of people have significant issues using it. Be sure to emphasize that with any concerns you raise.

**If we're loud, persistent, and polite, we can make this happen.** Thanks for everything thus far, slugs."

2. I took some courses at a California community college. There are 3 different multivariable classes at UCSC, and according to the articulation agreement, the one I took gives credit for each of them. Does this mean that I get 15 credits (5 for each of the classes), or do I only get 5 for the class which counts towards my major? I hope it is 15"

No matter your major or aptitude in the past with mathematics, any one of you is more than capable of passing your course. Whether it's pre-algebra or vector calculus, just practice and rehearse it like that last boss of a video game and eventually you'll beat it. I honestly believe that the thought one may have, ""I've never been good at math, I could never do that"", you're entirely wrong, and you absolutely can.  

With the online resources available, you can use solutions to assigned problems as a guide to how to complete certain questions, then choose a fresh problem and use the steps to solve it yourself. Please believe in yourself."
hisimq,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/hisimq/heres_why_you_should_still_avoid_hilltop/,Here's why you should still avoid Hilltop Apartments,28,28,2020-06-30 11:00:56,"Hilltop Apartments is a hot topic around here. I know a lot of people who live at Hilltop and a lot of people who used to love at Hilltop. Which makes sense, because it's a fairly large apartment complex and given the housing problems in Santa Cruz, it's inevitable that people will live here regardless of how bad it's reputation is.

I'm writing this because I want to emphasize how bad it is there. 

---

##Construction

The first thing is the construction, which dragged on for months. I honestly don't have that much of an issue with construction. I get up early on school days anyways, and the few times there was noise at night I can excuse. And the construction is mostly over now. 

The problem with the construction was the lack of any notice whatsoever for some things. For example - one day we woke up to see they were tearing down our balcony. To give them some credit, now that the balcony is finished, it looks fantastic - but we were given no warning that it was even going to be torn down! 

The other problem is the mess that comes with construction. Dust everywhere is to be expected, just because it gets in the air and settles naturally, and it's impossible to avoid this. But Hilltop took this to another level. Somehow, paint chips and other debris made it through closed windows and closed screen doors. The balcony door was *definitely* closed - there was no more balcony to even go to - but massive amounts of debris still got through. 

And a one more story to add about construction. [Here's a picture](https://i.imgur.com/fRH9XA0.jpg) of where they drilled into the side of our apartment. I think they were trying to install siding or roofing and missed somehow? But if you've ever used a drill bit to make a hole before, you know that the thing you drill in doesn't cease to exist - the stuff that used to be there comes flying out. This came with a side dish of debris on all our stuff. 

---

##Laundry

Laundry might not sound like an issue to you. It didn't sound like an issue to me, after all what could be worse than then on campus laundry rooms? 

Hilltop. That's what could be worse. It's basically a bigger on campus laundry room but with less maintenence. 

It's definitely fair for the school to charge us $1 to wash + $0.75 to dry. It costs money to use water and electricity, and by charging us per use instead of bundling it in our housing costs, they make sure you do a reasonable number of loads. 

So it's fair for Hilltop to charge as well, right? But wait - they charge $3 to wash + $2.50 to dry. And at UCSC, if a machine is broken, they have the courtesy to unplug it, and if there's a leak the maintenance mops it up within a reasonable amount of time. (Side note, bless the maintenence at UCSC.) But at Hilltop, they'll just let water run out on the floor for a while. And if a machine is broken, they'll just leave it broken and plugged in. If you put laundry in it, the machine will still eat your money but not properly wash your clothes. 

---

##Fake Reviews

Look up Hilltop and look at the reviews. Whatever site you go on, there are probably a few people like me who say ""avoid it at all costs, they made my life a living hell"". Then there's a bunch of people with weirdly positive comments that focus on things like ""they allow pets!"" and ""the view!"". (The view is average at best for Santa Cruz, let's be honest.) I'm sure some of these might be legitimate, but the fact that fake reviews exist should tell you enough about the place. 

---
 
##Other Things

Here's a few more reasons you might want to avoid Hilltop that aren't the management's fault. 

Location: If you live at Hilltop you'll be on the 20 route, which means you need to take the 20D/20/22 to campus. When not on COVID schedule, this means that the earliest bus to campus and to get downtown is around 7:20 am. The bigger issue is the late night and weekend schedule. If you have a late night class, there's a decent chance you could be waiting 45 minutes to an hour for a bus. And if you need to get anywhere on the weekends, the first bus doesn't leave until noon and the bus going down from campus is often close to full. 

Break-ins: There were a few incidents where cars parked on Western Drive were broken into. Not a huge issue since Hilltop has parking, just be wary in case you were planning on using street parking often. 

---

I understand that for a lot of people, Hilltop may be your only option. The housing crisis affects us all differently, and you might not have the opportunity to rent elsewhere. 

I also realize that I might sound crazy, or I'm just complaining to complain. I saw some people with negative opinions of Hilltop, and my roommates convinced me that they were just complaining to complain, and I accepted that mostly because it was so late and I had no other options. 

I firmly believe that Hilltop is one of the worst possible options in Santa Cruz. The new management might change some things but the fact that they care about renewals and new leases more than anything else remains. 


TLDR: The ""hill"" that they refer to in Hilltop Apartments is the pile of money they make from students."

What are some ways that help you stay accountable/responsible without a grade for a class or a boss pushing you to do something?

I am trying to get stuff done this summer. I have a job and I'd like to work on some side projects to learn and develop more/better skills. But my problem is that if I don't have a grade for a class or a boss holding me accountable, then I don't do what I would like to.

I've read some articles and things like that to try to get a better idea of how to fix this but nothing seems to work. I am motivated and excited to work on some my personal projects, but I struggle keeping that motivation up and executing my ideas after a day or two.

Some of the things I'd like to do in my day include developing (programming), reading, and watching webcasts/YouTube to learn/keep material fresh in my head to apply to my projects... really just anything to keep learn something that I am interested in. But my problem is that there is nothing forcing me to stick to a schedule and/or buckle down and do these activities.

I'd like to fix this (and my sleep schedule) to be as productive as possible, while making and doing things I like, but I no longer have any idea on how to keep myself accountable to myself when I don't have a grade or a boss hanging over my head.

What are some ways I can keep myself from deviating from my plans for the day to accomplish my personal and professional goals for the summer?

I am a rising sophomore and Aneli is a rising senior. She is my sorority big. I am very clean, and like the apartment not rancid... Aneli will clean up after herself too. Both of us can cook and we like having visitors. Aneli's bf sleeps over a lot, my bf and are long distance right now. We both have cars so if you need a ride we gotchu.

We're current UCSC students who created a data science startup and we're looking for people to join our team. While we cannot offer anything in terms of compensation as we are a new company, we believe this would be a valuable learning experience for anyone that is interested in getting into the Data Science filed. We've spent that last year developing our product and we just got ready to scale. Our product is an automated machine learning website. We're looking for people that either have strong interest in the field, skills in python, or strong mathematical skills. We will teach you the majority of the knowledge on the job, however, require that you have some basic programming/math skills. If you are interested please feel free to send me a DM and we tell you some more concrete details. Thanks!"

Aside from learning tons of useful and fancy skills, Formula Slug is a great way to get connected with industry professionals. We work closely with local EV companies like Tesla, Zero Motorcycles, Joby Aviation, etc... Many of our alumni have gotten hired straight out of UCSC because of their experience with Formula Slug and many of those same alumni are still active within Formula Slug to help guide new members and bring industry knowledge to our club.

From the 11/16/2020 email sent to FSH residents:  


&gt;**Dear Family Student Housing Residents,**  
&gt;  
&gt;**We are excited to share that a plan to bring high speed internet to Family Student Housing (FSH) has been identified. Funds available to the campus through the CARES Act will support this project. The upgrade will bring the quality of the internet service at FSH up to the same level as the campus’s residential network internet service. It will be faster, more reliable and more secure. The work will be occurring on a rolling basis beginning Feb 1 through March 31, 2021.**     
&gt;  
&gt;**Because this upgrade will take time to fully implement, we are seeking to identify a west side location in a residence hall that would allow you and your family members to have remote work and study space that is on the campus network. You will be kept informed by FSH administration as more information becomes available regarding the location, timing and process to check out usage of the space. We anticipate it will be available in late November.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**In the coming weeks, a schedule of the building upgrades will be published on the** [**FSH Internet Upgrade project webpage**](https://ucsc.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6af7392060bf9273a90c0dd7d&amp;id=18b7bccc2a&amp;e=4f4c27a596)**. Information about the residence hall space will be shared by the FSH administration.**   
&gt;  
&gt;**Thank you for taking the time to complete the survey and for reporting your service needs. The data that you provided was immensely useful in helping us understand the scope and extent of the problems that were not adequately addressed by the hot spot installation we performed over the summer. We now have a pathway ahead that will meet everyone’s needs.**   
&gt;  
&gt;**Thank you for your patience. Please know that the campus is committed to improving this situation as quickly as possible. If we can accelerate the timeline in any way, we will.**

I transferred from a community college in Fall 2019 as a computer science student but I haven't had the best experience in my learning ability.

I'm currently taking CSE 101 for the second time and at this point I'm not sure I can complete a computer science degree.  There are 3 main points I ranked that I feel can be my next steps if CS does not work out for me:

1. I am really considering other majors as a plan B.  I might still want to remain in the tech industry so I've been thinking about Cognitive Science, I've been thinking about UX / UI/ product design as an option.  I feel like this could be a best option for me since some of my core CS/Math classes also fulfill some Cog Sci classes but I'm worried if the department will let me change my major this late into my college career.
2. Alternatively if I wanted to continue in CS, maybe UCSC wouldn't be the place to do that.  So I was thinking I would transfer myself to a state school in my hometown in the Bay Area where I wouldn't have to pay for housing (once schools open up again) and maybe the material wouldn't be as rigorous.
3. Or worse case, I obtain an easy degree that's fast to complete and obtain a city job in my area.

Keep in mind I really wanted to finish what I started but I'm just not finding much motivation and patience to complete computer science, especially during the pandemic.  Even if I do graduate, I'm expecting the job search and my actual job to be incredibly stressful as well.  If I'm struggling this early in my career, how can I make it once I work?

If anyone has any advice that could help me in my struggles I would really appreciate it.  I'm sorry for the rant, I'm just not in a good mental state as of currently."

Sue's plan to hire back instructors on an as needed basis is idiotic and short sighted.  Most if not all of these instructors will not return and the courses WILL BE WORSE.  Particularly in the case of scuba, safety will become a huge concern as the dive safety officer was completely left out of the decision making process.

I'm majoring in Computer Engineering, and I was wondering if any of you have advice on the classes in general, the amount of rigor or studying is required to do well (I dunno if that was grammatically correct, sorry), what the atmosphere of the campus is like, post-grad success, etc. 

How is housing? If you graduated from UCSC, where are you now? What's the outlook for housing/education while Miss Rona is still on the run? How prestigious is the school in terms of CS/CSE (I'm seeing a lot of CS/CSE majors on this sub, so I assume it's a popular major, but is the education good)? Who are the teachers/profs I'll come across, and who teaches well and why? How do I survive the stricter teachers and please them?

The other two UCs I'm considering (if I get accepted, that is) would be UC Irvine or UC Davis, and I also applied there for CS/CSE, and I've been trying to do research through different college journals and websites or Quora and there seems to be a different opinion each time, but what do you guys think?

My LOA is scheduled to end at the beginning of the Fall Quarter, so that would be my first quarter back at school. 
I’ve been looking through information on the UCSC Website and I’m really not clear on what I’m supposed to do. I thought I had to fill out a readmission form so I went to the readmissions page but there it says, “LOA students are automatically reactivated for their approved return term.”
I don’t really understand what this means. What does “automatically reactivated” entail exactly? Upon taking my leave of absence I was instructed to cancel any housing applications I had setup, so I was under the assumption that I don’t have a housing guarantee anymore. Is that true? 
When it comes to enrolling in classes, do I just go to the UCSC portal and enrol in courses like I would have if I’d never taken the LOA? When do I start doing enrolling? Since this would be for the up and coming Fall Quarter, would I start enrolling now or wait until the Summer Quarter is drawing to a close? 

What about UC SHIP? Will my “automatic reactivation” also mean that I’m automatically signed up for UC SHIP like usually happens each quarter? 
And do I have to fill out a readmission form? The Readmission Page seems to think I don’t but I want to be sure. 
Should I contact specific staff or offices to ask about this stuff, and if so, who do I contact?"

Due to personal reasons, lifes kinda whack right now (more than usual) and I am having to travel back and forth to home a lot (4 hours) to help out with a family emergency. aannnyway, I am only taking 1 class this quarter that actually relates to what I need to graduate and the other two are just kinda cause I had to have 3 classes. I am done with my gen ed and major courses after this quarter besides 1.  
SO. my question is, I know that I have to petition for a reason to get one of my classes dropped and only do two so that I can actually function as a human being, but how will my aid be affected? has anyone done this and do I just notify the financial aid office that I had a valid reason approved theoretically etc and that's it? Or am I going to lose a bunch of aid? I just am a little confused how that comes into it. if it helps, my EFC is literally 0 lol.

I saw someone else post about petitioning to take less credits and really got some hope that it could help me. I genuinely do not need the class I am in and would rather not have to worry about my GPA because of a filler class.....

There is no point in hiding from it and making a majority of classes online. 

Classes should be hybrid to where you can attend the class in person and online. This has proven to be able to be done. Classes should not strictly be online or in person. This severely limits the amount of students on campus and limits those who are choosing to come to Santa Cruz and those who want to stay home.

o0v0io,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/o0v0io/a_warning_about_sage_corps_a_potentially/,"A warning about Sage Corps, a potentially predatory internship company",76,11,2021-06-15 19:51:45,"I wish I had known what I was getting into with Sage Corps. I’m a student in debt, and I lost $2000.

Sage Corps is an internship placement company that asks “top students” to pay thousands of dollars to do an unpaid internship. But I’m warning you that they are a potentially predatory company. If you really were a top student, why would you need to pay someone to do an unpaid internship?

First, Sage Corps hunts students down through their emails to university departments, asking them to spam their students. My university, unfortunately, did not foresee that I would become the company’s prey.

Their application process traps students. The interviewer only asked me a few behavioral questions, so there was no formal screening process—their claim of sending “top students” is shady. After the interview, I was asked to sign a binding contract and pay a $1000 initial deposit. But I had to sign this contract months before they placed me with a company. Little did I know that Sage Corps would later use the binding contract to extort $2000 from me.

During the two months following the contract signing, they helped me edit my resume—a service worth $5 on Fiverr.com—and gave me access to this “career accelerator program,” a compilation of around $100 worth of Udemy courses. The only thing I paid for with real value was the housing, provided through Sage Corps by a third-party, at $3000. 

But something unexpected happened related to COVID-19. When I asked Sage Corps if I needed a visa for my internship, they said I needed a CPT. So, I saw my university counselor, but he told me that since I was an international student who did his first year online and not in-person, I could not get CPT authorization. Sage Corps—despite knowing that I am a first-year international student doing online school—did not check beforehand whether I was eligible for the internship. Nothing on their website, unlike other companies detailing internship requirements, mentioned the need for a CPT. 

I informed Sage Corps I was not authorized to do an internship. They scheduled a call for me with the company’s CEO. He suggested I enter the US as a tourist to do the unpaid internship, pay for travel to and one-night stay in Canada after the internship, and return to the US to activate my F1 visa. Does this proposition, from a professional international internship company, sound legitimate?  

And the CEO failed to be reasonable and understanding throughout. When I asked for a refund because of circumstances that made it impossible to do the internship, he blamed me. He blamed me for circumstances caused by COVID-19. He even refused to give a refund minus Sage Corps’s incurred costs. 

I tried to reason with him through email, again and again. I let him know that my parents had to take loans to finance my education, so him taking thousands of dollars—for no mistake of my own—was a gunshot wound. 

More unreasonable was that he told me he had given us, this summer’s cohort, the wrong contract to sign. I was bound to a contract for a remote internship, which cost $2000. I never wanted to do a remote internship, and I made that clear from the start. 

So, even though he admitted the contract was a mistake, he said I had to do the online internship program or that he could only refund me $2000. He made me liable for his mistake, and he even tried to gaslight me. He said I failed to sign the new in-person-internship contract unlike the other students—but he never sent me this contract—and was obligated to pay $6800. He said he was making an “exception” to his policy by giving me $2000 of $4000 back. 

When I pleaded for at least the $3000 housing payment, he said Sage Corps has incurred costs like the resume editing and learning modules that have “already been activated and paid for.” 

But that was a lie. After refunding me $2000, he deactivated the learning modules. He could reverse the arrangement with Udemy all along. 

I’m a student in debt, and Sage Corps and its CEO tried to manipulate me to work without authorization, tried to gaslight me into thinking I’m to blame for COVID-19 circumstances, and bullied and lied to me. This is how a predator would behave: hunting me down, trapping me, deceiving and wounding me, and taking my money. 

Today, I’m $2000 more in debt because of Sage Corps. 

I hope my post will save you from Sage Corps and similar unethical companies and prevent you from making the same mistake I did: selling myself short and paying thousands for work.

I'm a senior about to graduate and I took 3 upper divs this quarter(CS Major). While I did well in 2 of the classes, I ended up with a 68% when a 69% is a C on the last. The final was 60% of the grade in this class so I just needed a difference of 7 points out of 422.

I contacted the professor pretty much as soon as the grade came out, asking for the opportunity to give detailed corrections, explanations, additional problems/work, or anything the professor could think of to make up that tiny difference so I can graduate. His response was pretty much nothing of consideration, just a no. I followed up, and his response was ""this response is only to verify I have seen the email, my previous response is sufficient""

What should I do now? I've never had a professor so unwilling to even negotiate or have such little care for whether or not people pass his class. Is there anyone that would be able to help? The school of engineering? Maybe the DRC (im a drc student)?

Turnout is expected to be low, so your vote will be very important!

To vote in this election, you must register to vote by August 30th.  You can register to vote or check your registration [here](https://registertovote.ca.gov/).  If you miss this deadline, you can register and vote in person at a [same-day registration location](https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voter-registration/same-day-reg) up until Election Day.

Ballots will have two questions. The first question is asking if Governor Newsom should be recalled and removed from office.  Vote “yes” if you want him removed from office; vote “no” if you do not.  The second question is who should become Governor if Newsom is recalled.  You can choose a candidate regardless of how you vote on Question #1.

For this election, every voter who registers by August 30th will be mailed a ballot.  Ballots must be postmarked by Election Day, September 14th, and received by September 17th.  Send yours in as soon as possible, or return it to a drop box - see [your county’s election website](https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voting-resources/county-elections-offices) for a list of drop box locations.

You can check the status of your ballot [here](https://voterstatus.sos.ca.gov/).

I'm aiming for a UC GPA 4.1-4.24 weighted, unweighted 3.875. non capped weighted GPA around 4.6-4.7, unweighted 3.9 ish. Not sure if I calculated that right, just an estimate. Do UCs only look at UC GPA or both capped and uncapped? By the end of senior year, I'll probably have taken 8 AP classes, 8 honors. I don't want all the APs/H classes I took to be disregarded bc of the 8 semester limit for UC GPA. 

My extracurriculars aren't great compared to some people at my super competitive high school. looking to improve them. I did violin for 5 years (private lessons and school orchestra), a summer internship with a tech company, and was in the Key Club freshman year. I'm looking to join 1-2 clubs junior year or another extracurricular. Maybe some volunteering next summer and a summer job. Do my extracurriculars taken after I send in my college apps matter? Or do I need to do all this before sending in my apps? For hobbies, Im trying to get back into art, reading, and baking. I enjoyed these pre-depression. 

And ofc I'm starting junior yr so I don't have any letters of rec or essays yet. Idk if I'll take the SAT since UCs don't need it.

I'm interested in majoring in something bio related for undergrad, and maybe med school for grad. I've heard good things about bio at UCSC, and I like the location. As I have multiple mental illnesses (depression, anxiety, eating disorder) I have a treatment team already established. I see my pediatrician, therapist, psychiatrist, and dietitan regularly. I live in the Bay Area so ideally I'd go to school nearby so I can see my providers sometimes virtually and in person. Not exactly interested in switching providers ATM and I can stay on my parents health insurance and they're all within close distance. 

Sorry if these posts are annoying, I'm just wondering if I have a shot at UCSC since UCs are soo competitive now?"

I am looking for experienced coders/developers to help me create a dating site that is for UCSC only, or an app, whichever is easier to make...

As of now, I cant offer any sort of payment for your work, but if it does become a success I would like to implement a donation option for students who have found it useful.

If you look at this Reddit or are a UCSC student you probably know how bad and the housing situation can be in Santa Cruz.

I'm from a small team of students working to open a student-volunteer-run homeless shelter for disadvantaged UCSC students experiencing housing troubles. We were inspired by similar projects created at UCLA and USC called the Bruin Shelter and Trojan Shelters and feel that UCSC needs this as well.

We've been working on it since November of 2020 and the project has really come a long ways but still has a long ways to go till we're fully operational and serving students.

We're looking for a reliable current UCSC undergraduate or graduate student with leadership skills to join a team of students who care about serving fellow students in tough situations to help us take this organization into the 21-22 school year in various capacities. Specifically, we're looking for a Director of Legal Affairs to join our officer team to help us make this shelter happen!

If interested in being a part of this awesome project, click [this link](https://forms.gle/JBdFULPFBW3gNUmX8) and submit an application, we'd love to meet you!

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to message this Reddit account!
