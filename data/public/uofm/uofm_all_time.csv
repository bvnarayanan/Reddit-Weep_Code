No one ever decides to go to college and if they do, they attend community college. I wanted to break this. For four years, I joined all the clubs I could and tried to stay in the top of my class. As an upcoming freshman in college, I was excited to apply to UMich as an OOS student. It was my number one school and when I actually got my admission letter, I cried happy tears for the rest of that day. I was going to stay with my uncle who lived nearby and I'd be able to attend the school for cheap because I wouldn't dorm. GREAT! Recently, I got my financial aid information and I was devastated. It would be enough if I was going to stay with my uncle, but he refused to let me stay with him just last week. I was heartbroken. All the hard work just to go to an instate state school like everyone other kid in my school. I cut my losses and started preparing for another college other then UMich. But, then I got this scholarship letter giving me enough to dorm and go to UMich for basically instate tuition. My mom called me in tears while I was in school and I literally screamed in joy. I started to cry and everyone was so confused BUT I DIDNT CARE. It was truly a godsend to get this unexpected scholarship and I'm still on the euphoria high.

I just want to thank UMich for giving me this opportunity and letting me break the streak in my family. UMich is truly a blessing and if anyone is in the position I was in (where its too expensive), there's always still a chance. Thanks for being there UMich when all was going wrong. #UMich'21 &lt;3"

I made a post here asking for help in this situation earlier on this week and was really disappointed by the obvious responses of ""If you aren't already doing well then you don't deserve the major and other people have it so much worse than you and do just fine"" but I don't know what I really expected.  To those of you that have disappointed yourselves academically here, even if it was due to totally deliberate poor choices you now know how not to make, I just wanted to say the following:

We're surrounded by perfection and excellence here, but you got in for a reason.  You aren't any less deserving of this school and the prestige that comes with it.  Don't listen to what people say, it may be nice to be able to prepare yourself effectively enough to answer exam questions and finish quality work every single time, and more power to all the people whose personal decisions and life circumstances don't conflict in such a way that prevents them from being able to foresee their academic failure no matter how obvious it may have been in hindsight, but if this is not you, you're just as worthy of this school and of considering yourself an intellectual, a Wolverine, a victor, the leaders and best, whathaveyou, even if your GPA might not show it and you might not quite feel like you fit in with the average level of organization and life accomplishments, or if you don't really know who you are or what you really want to do with yourself.  Get help, get honest with yourself, get rid of the life factors that may be holding you back, and give yourself another chance without being afraid to try something you never previously saw yourself majoring in.  I know I've got no choice.

Tl;dr If your grades are bad here, don't listen to the haters, you're still objectively smart and worthy of giving yourself another chance.

EDIT in case anyone cares, I went in for the meeting and am going to be allowed another attempt at the course I failed twice, in order to complete the minor, provided I meet certain conditions which I'm pretty sure I can.  The advisor was incredibly friendly and understanding, I'm really glad that I went, thank you for all the support and I hope this is useful to anyone else in my position.  Don't give up on yourself and go blue!"

I'm in a bit of a housing pinch right now.  I dropped my frat because I really didn't feel like I vibed well with the people there after several semesters of trying to, but with that my social life became totally lost and I really want to live in some sort of community of progressive, forward-thinking individuals along the lines of a co-op or the more brotherly frats I wish I had joined, but I moved too slowly on joining a co-op and now they are all full.  I'm pissed, because I was certain joining a co-op was a ticket to finally having a community of actual friends at this school (as opposed to at MSU where all my close friends that aren't graduating next year go).  

So, do any of you know of any kind of non-ICC, non-greek life off-campus housing community that's looking for new members still?  Thanks a lot for any help you can offer!  

Also, for anyone wanting to join a co-op, since I don't want you making my same mistakes, take it from me, you have to HOUND them to get them to communicate with you and to reserve a place, because I""m disappointed as fuck that this didn't work out for me.  


Tl;dr where can I still live off-campus with a cool community that isn't a co-op that can fill the void left by me disaffiliating with my frat?"

Fun fact that I'm not sure many have realized: While many other schools chose their places just due to proximity, our starting pixel was chosen with more purpose.

66b2bz,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/66b2bz/chez_betty_is_being_shut_down_lets_save_it/,"Chez Betty is Being Shut Down, Let's Save It!",89,40,2017-04-19 08:53:14,"In case you haven't heard yet, the provost's office is trying to shut down Chez Betty. There was an email outlining this that was sent out to Betty Users recently, and I figured it would be a good idea to spread the message. Here's the email in case you didn't get it or haven't seen it yet:


&gt; Hello everyone,

&gt; The rumors are true: the Provost’s office has decided to shut down Chez Betty. Over the past year, we have repeatedly met with the administration to try to keep Betty running. Unfortunately, although CSE and CoE administrators have been very supportive, we were unable to convince the Provost’s office of the importance of Betty to CSE and the broader North Campus community. At this point we’re out of options, and we need your help.

&gt; While student-run food operations are typically disallowed, we hoped that Betty would be grandfathered in, similar to the DB Cafe and Pi Tau Sigma’s bratwurst stand. Unfortunately, the University administration has chosen not to grandfather Betty, and they’ve provided us with no information as to why, nor an avenue to appeal. As a Betty customer, we need you to call or email these decision makers and urge them to reconsider grandfathering Chez Betty. To be clear, the goal is to ask for a change in policy. As with any advocacy campaign, please be courteous when talking with these individuals.

&gt; The administrators to contact are:

&gt; Amy Dittmar, Vice Provost for Academic and Budgetary Affairs
Phone: 734-763-1282
Email: adittmar@umich.edu

&gt; Frances Mueller, Associate Vice Provost for Academic and Budgetary Affairs
Phone: 734-763-5942
Email: francesm@umich.edu

&gt; Remember, phone calls are more effective than emails, but emails are better than nothing. Whether you call or email (or, heck, stage a peaceful protest), we’d love it if you send us a note (or cc) to let us know how it went.

&gt; Some talking points:

&gt; Explain why Betty is important to you and has improved your experience as a student.
Explain why other North Campus food operations are insufficient.
Do not be placated by promises that things are being worked on.
There is a massive disconnect in the perception of North Campus food options between the administrators who sit in Fleming and the people who live and work on North Campus.
In meetings, we have been told that a study of campus food operations in 2008 revealed the need for more and better food options. As of 2017, the solution is food trucks on the Diag two hours a month. Betty is open 24/7/365, unlike any other North Campus food operation. We served a dozen customers on Christmas Day last year.
While the administration has been “talking about” putting a 24/7 operation on North Campus for over a year, the only action they have taken thus far is to order the shutdown of the only available 24/7 food operation.
What’s going to happen to Betty?

&gt; Unless the administration reconsiders its position, Betty will be forced to shut down when the semester ends at the end of April.

&gt; What about the money in my Betty account? 
We intend to refund the money that users have in their accounts. Assuming that we sell our remaining inventory, and that users do not go further into debt, we will pay back user balances at the end of the term. However, now, more than ever, it is important to encourage people who owe Betty money to pay their debts.

&gt; How will you return the money in user accounts to Betty users? 
We’re still working out the details, but we promise that deposits will be refunded. If you have paid online with a credit or debit card, it looks like we’ll be able to issue refunds that way. For everyone else, we will work something out. The easiest way, however, is to spend down your balance at Betty!

&gt; Can I still use Betty for the rest of the term? 
Yes! If we do have to shut down, we will need to dispose of our inventory, so every bit you buy helps!

&gt; What can I do to help? 
Most importantly, please contact the Provost’s office and ask them to reconsider grandfathering Betty. Second, if you know anyone who owes money to Betty, ask them to pay their debt. Third, keep on using Betty--we’ll be there for you as long as we can!

&gt; What is the grandfathering rule? 
This is from the University’s “Food Service Planning Guidelines”, available here: http://foodplanning.umich.edu/download/FoodServicePlanningGuidelines.pdf. Ratified in 2016, the policy essentially forbids “student-run food operations”, but includes a grandfather clause:

&gt; The Office of the Provost and the Office of Vice President for Student Life are aware of a small number of existing student-run food service operations on the Ann Arbor campus. These operations have been granted special permission to continue operating with the understanding they are complying with current University and government rules, laws, and regulations.

&gt; Unfortunately, the Provost’s office has declined to include Chez Betty in the list of organizations they are willing to grandfather. We have been granted no transparency into this decision, and, as far as we can tell, there is no policy guiding what organizations will be grandfathered. Our requests for the grandfathering policy, and for the history of the food service guidelines, have been denied. We are concerned that this is arbitrary and unfair treatment, and a disservice to the communities Betty serves.

&gt; I’ve never been to North Campus. What’s Betty?
 
&gt; Chez Betty is a self-service market in the Beyster building that was created by students in 2012 to serve North Campus, which has notoriously few options for food and convenience store items, especially after hours. It’s operated by CSEG, the CSE graduate student group, and run entirely by volunteers. It has stable management (with a board that turns over only every five years or so) and is exempt from needing a license under MCL 289.4105(1)(g). All sales are on the honor system, and customers can run balances or even go into debt when they have to. Payments take place with a self-scan computer kiosk, developed by CS students, that has been translated into six languages and accepts cash or credit cards. It’s open 24/7/365...at least until the Provost shuts it down. In 2017 alone, Betty has served over 1,900 people, including Michigan undergrads, grad students, staff, faculty, deans, and alumni. Engineering Student Government passed a resolution in favor of the continued operation of Chez Betty.

&gt; I have more questions... 
There is a post in the CSE Facebook group with all of this information copied: Facebook Post 
We’ll be around to answer questions there. Please bear with us as we all try to figure this out together.

&gt; Thanks again for being a Betty customer, and we’re truly sorry to share this news.

&gt;Dear all,

&gt;This morning, representatives from the Chez Betty Team, CSE, CoE, and the Provost’s Office, including Provost Paul Courant, met to discuss the future of Chez Betty.

&gt;We came together with the same goal, “How do we enable Betty to continue while meeting appropriate state and federal requirements?” We are thrilled to announce that we have reached an agreement that gives Betty a path to continue operating and addresses the administration’s concerns.

&gt;Betty will close temporarily at the end of the term in order to incorporate, obtain insurance and a state retail food establishment license, and handle various other compliance needs. We plan to reopen as soon as possible after that, once we have all of these things in place--hopefully by Betty’s next birthday in early July.

&gt;This outstanding resolution happened because so many of you--students, alumni, staff, faculty, and deans--reached out and made your voices heard. We are grateful for your support as well as the partnership of the Provost’s Office for responding in such a timely and positive manner. This solution reaffirms Michigan’s support for student-driven problem solving and entrepreneurship. It’s also a reflection of what the North Campus community (and the central administration) can accomplish when we come together.

&gt;We wish everyone the best of luck with the end of the term.

&gt;Forever Go Blue (and Go Betty!),

You’ve certainly gotten their attention! These efforts resulted in a reply (included below) from Frances Mueller, the Associate Vice Provost, who has been leading the effort to shut Betty down. Unfortunately, the reply further illustrates how the central administration is seemingly indifferent to the needs of North Campus and why Betty is so important to our community and culture.

&gt;We have received several reports that the Vice Provost’s office is no longer willing to take down student feedback about Betty. We are severely disheartened that the Vice Provost’s office is unwilling to listen to concerns from the North Campus community. Thus we are escalating and asking you to contact the Office of the Provost directly:

&gt;Office of the Provost

&gt;(734) 764-9290

&gt;provost@umich.edu

&gt;Recall, this is an advocacy campaign. Be courteous and respectful. But also be persistent. Do not let them simply take your name and move on. Ask that they contact you specifically to respond to your concerns. Make clear that the formation of a committee to eventually, possibly investigate the matter is not an acceptable response. Explain that the Vice Provost’s office was unwilling to listen to your concerns. It’s time to let them know that North Campus matters---if you haven’t called or emailed yet, today’s your chance! If you have, thank you, and please call again to let them know that this response is unacceptable.

&gt;Help us protect the North Campus community that is so uniquely a part of our Michigan experience.

&gt;Thanks,

&gt;-Brad, Pat, &amp; Zakir

&gt;We wanted to share this response with the Betty community, as well as our thoughts on several points from the email:

&gt;From: Frances Mueller &lt;francesm@umich.edu&gt;
&gt;Subj: IMPORTANT &amp; TIME-SENSITIVE: Chez Betty message to CSE

&gt;(Frances) Dear CSE students, staff, and faculty members:

&gt;(Betty) Actually, the Betty community is far larger than just CSE! Students, faculty, and staff from Mechanical to Biomedical Engineering come to Betty. We have architects, artists, and people from the School of Music Theater and Dance. Betty is a service enjoyed by thousands of people across the whole North Campus community, and it’s a manifestation of the culture of creative problem-solving that North Campus is all about.

&gt;(Frances) Thank you for sharing your thoughts and concerns about the Chez Betty operation. We appreciate your input and understand your interest and the importance of having food available to you.

&gt;(Betty) “We ... understand ... the importance of having food available to you.”
Again, Betty is not just about food, it’s a part of our culture. How are they addressing this concern?

&gt;(Frances) I'd like to share the university's perspective on this, but first I'll provide a little background information for context.
Several years ago, the university formed a Food Service Review Committee to ensure thoughtful and strategic placement of food operations on campus. The committee is comprised of representatives from Student Life, Environmental Health and Safety, the University Planner’s Office, Architecture, Engineering and Construction, the Provost's Office, and Procurement. It also includes a representative from the Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning, who provides school/college insight as well as a North Campus perspective.

&gt;(Betty) A university committee (with only one representative from North Campus) is on the case. It has been 9 years since the 2008 food study revealed demand for more and better food service options. What have they done about the food situation on North Campus...?

&gt;(Frances) The committee has had a few recent discussions about North Campus and is in the process of bringing in an external food service consultant to assist with an overall North Campus assessment. We are specifically asking the consultant to assess the current and anticipated North Campus population, existing North Campus food service locations, and demand, and to make recommendations. We've started working with Procurement to bring the consultant on board and expect recommendations this summer.

&gt;(Betty) ...the committee has discussed the process of engaging a consultant to assist in assessing North Campus’s needs. Meanwhile, the Provost’s office is shutting down the only 24/7 food option, an option created by the community in response to its needs, which has been relied upon for years by thousands of people. What necessitates this drastic step?

&gt;(Frances) In terms of the Chez Betty operation itself, we have been communicating with Chez Betty and the College of Engineering Dean's Office since the fall. We made the decision to close the operation because Chez Betty does not comply with the university's well-established process for assessing the need for food service in a university building and has been operating without proper state licensing or regulation.

&gt;(Betty) There you have it! After months of asking, this is the first clear explanation of why Chez Betty is being closed:

&gt;1. Betty “does not comply with the university’s process for assessing the need for food”:

&gt; What? Betty’s existence demonstrates the unmet need for food, and helps solve it. No committee has to spend years discussing engaging a consultant to assist in this assessment! The situation illustrates a problem with the process, not with Betty.

&gt;2. Betty “has been operating without proper state licensing or regulation.”

&gt; We believe Betty is exempt from needing a food service license under MCL 289.4105(1)(g), since it “only sells prepackaged, non-potentially-hazardous foods” and “offers only an incidental amount of food, such as the sale of single-service packages”. Despite multiple requests for clarification, the Provost’s office has not stated what regulations or licensing requirements they think we are not in compliance with, but if Betty really does need a license, we’d be happy to get one!

&gt;(Frances) I understand that this isn’t the response that you were hoping for, but we really do understand that North Campus has a need and we are being thoughtful about a solution.

&gt;(Betty) This is not what being thoughtful about a solution looks like, it is what bureaucratic insensitivity to the needs of real people looks like. Understanding the need is not the same as addressing it, which Chez Betty does. If anyone at the Provost’s Office would like to understand the needs of North Campus, they are welcome to spend next week working late out of the Beyster Building with us.

&gt;(Frances) We appreciate your patience and will take your concerns seriously as we plan future food service operations. In the meantime, we will continue to work with the College of Engineering to keep you informed.

&gt;(Betty) Continue to ... keep us informed? There’s been a lack of transparency to our community throughout the entire process. The Provost’s office needs to become more informed about how engineers think about problem solving and about how Betty serves the needs of North Campus. This is your chance to call or email them to help them understand our community’s perspective.

&gt; It’s not too late to reverse this decision. Your support will make a difference!

&gt;(Frances) Best regards, Frances Mueller"
69cmoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/69cmoc/for_freshman_possibly_worrying_about_bursley/,For Freshman possibly worrying about Bursley...,65,12,2017-05-04 21:32:21,"So I am now a sophomore in LSA, and I remember the days of picking out housing as a senior in high school and hearing the bad stuff about Bursley, and worrying. There were those few, rare comments of how Bursley was fine, and I want to expand on that and calm some of your worries.

I spent freshman year in Bursley, and I had a really positive experience. Bursley is not as bad as some people make it out to be. 

The dining hall food was overall decent; some days they had some bombass food, other days it felt kind of dull--but that happens. Experimenting with the food can keep things interesting so you don't get bored. 

The dorm rooms are somewhat smaller than the dorms on central campus, but they are still a good size. Half-lofting your bed leaves a lot of space underneath for bins, suitcases, boxes, a fold-able chair, etc. Lofting your bed completely doesn't leave much room to sit on your bed comfortably. If you're on the last floor, you have about 2 feet of extra height in your room, so lofting is more comfortable. Also, some of my friends didn't loft their beds at all, but flipped their bed upside down so the headboard rested on the floor. This gave a nice amount of space without half-lofting and having your bed be high, or not lofting at all. (It is not technically allowed, but you can probably get away with it.)

So you will probably spend orientation in East Quad and see their lovely bathrooms. Bursley was built in the 60s so the bathrooms are not as cute, but they function and they're alright. They're communal with many sinks and stalls, then a shower room with six showers and shower curtains (more than enough). Bring flip flops for the showers! Also, for girls: some girl bathrooms have urinals--don't be nervous when you walk in and think you're in the wrong place!

Now let's talk about the commute. All my classes were on central, but commuting for me wasn't bad. In the morning, there are typically about seven or eight Bursley-Baits buses running, so it usually takes a few minutes of waiting for the bus. In the evening is when there are fewer Bursley-Baits buses running, but again, not bad. And you can track the buses with the Michigan app and get use to everything. I gave myself about 20-25 minutes for commuting.

Before I came to Michigan, I kept hearing how Bursley wasn't much of a social dorm. Sure, Bursley's configuration is a little weird, but Bursley is social when an effort is made to meet people in your hall or in the lounges or in the dining hall. I saw many people hanging out in lounges or chattering in the halls. Tips: leave your door open when you're in your room the first few weeks so your hallmates and others can introduce themselves, and do the same if you see a door open! And in the dining halls, especially in the first few weeks, join someone at the table and eat with them. 

Some notes about North Campus: North Campus is beautiful and quiet. The Duderstadt Library, or the Dude, is almost a ten minute walk away from Bursley and is a really nice place to study. The Dude also has the Computer and Video Game Archive in the basement, which has hundreds of video games and old and new consoles that you can play on. North Campus also has its own small diag, the ""Grove"", which is fun to skate around, and it also has a volleyball court too. 

To sum it up, don't worry too much about Bursley if you end up there your freshman year! I made some great memories in Bursley, and don't regret dorming there. :)

68nwg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/68nwg7/my_summer_internship_cancelled_on_me_what_now/,My summer internship cancelled on me. What now?,20,14,2017-05-01 11:52:56,"Hello everyone,

The company I was supposed to be working for this summer just sent me an email today saying that they are ""tabling"" my internship after weeks of little to no communication with me (before I'd even started any work at all).  In hindsight I now realize how naive it was of me to let this become my whole summer plan without having signed any contracts or made anything totally solid yet, I guess I was just overly excited to finally be offered some sort of job that involved a level of leadership.

All that aside, does anyone know if it's not too late in the game to get an internship somewhere in the Ann Arbor area?  I'm still an undeclared major (was going to be making videos for a company because I used to be a film major and filmmaking and photography are easily currently my best-developed talent), but I am leaning towards a major in sociology with a sub-major in law, justice and social change.  I would love to find some internship or summer job that's directly related to this, but I'm really not getting my hopes up.

Where should I look for some kind of internship to replace the one that cancelled me?  I have enough money to get me through the next few weeks, but I definitely need to be able to earn more soon enough.  By no means am I above grueling manual labor jobs (wouldn't be my first choice but I'd be willing to do these if it comes to it), and I'd really just like some source of money that won't suck too much, so does anyone know a good place to look for those?  I found the one I lost through handshake.com, I don't want to judge that whole website because of one bad encounter, but I now feel that I could have broadened my job search slightly.  

Thanks a lot for any help you can offer!!!

Tl;dr I got fucked over and backstabbed by the internship I was convinced I had, where do I even start in my search for a replacement one this late in the game?"

I recently graduated with my Master’s at U of M after 6 years here. (4 Bachelor + 2 Graduate school). During my tenure here, I have been the president of a club, graduated with honors (twice!) gone to every homegame coached by Harbaugh so far, got the highscore at a pinball machine at Pinball Petes, played both bell towers, taught 3 semesters of an upper level undergraduate class, and wrote a Master’s thesis; and that isn't half of it. I noticed that a lot of freshman and recently admitted people lurk this sub, so I wanted to share my wisdom with you all- hopefully this is helpful! For brevity, my tips are just bullet points organized into sections. Some of my advice is general, other things are specific places or things to do. If you measure success via happiness, then I was very successful at our beloved Umich! I wish somebody had told me the things I am about to share, but then again learning this stuff for myself was very fun.
  
**What to do generally**  
•	Organize your time  
•	Use Google calendar  
•	Try different clubs  
•	Go to football games.  
o	If you don’t like football, still go at least once. Half the fun is waking up early with your friends and just having fun being in college. We have the largest football stadium in America. Why not go? If you really hate it (you won’t) you can always sell your student tickets for a profit.  
•	Talk to the locals and upperclassmen  
•	Talk to your professors regularly.   
•	Explore the city  
•	Get immunized for common viruses at UHS. You won’t regret a flu shot when it is exam time. UHS has vaccinations for just about everything including HPV.  
•	Go to UHS when you are sick. It can be crowded but the service has been good in my experience- other people may disagree.  
•	Learn about the legend of the north campus hot tub and find Chez Betty- the best snack lounge ever. https://www.michigandaily.com/news/mystery-hot-tub-north-campus  
•	Learn a foreign language. Just do duolingo or memrise every day for a semester- you will be amazed at how quickly you can learn a language even as a leisurely habit. It is a better habit than going on facebook/insta/twitter/reddit obsessively.  
•	Don’t try to do everything. You might feel like you can do anything- maybe you can- but you just don’t have enough time to be an expert at everything!  
•	If you learn how to longboard, learn to break. This saved me a few times. I cringe everytime I see a new longboarder crash into people or nearly destroy their board because they didn’t take 5 minutes to learn how to break properly.  
•	Learn to cook.  
•	Careful where you park. It is easy to get a ticket or get towed in treetown.  
	
  
**What to do academically**  
•	Stay curious- don’t just get the answer when doing your homework. Understand every part of the assignment you complete and be as thorough as possible. Think of your entire semester as a study session and you won’t need to cram as hard for exams.  
•	Take care of your mental health. Take care of your mind like you would a leg injury or stomach flu. Your mind is your main tool in your education!   
•	Do not procrastinate. You won’t have time to procrastinate anyways if you want to be successful and have fun. Pick two: procrastinate, have fun, do well in classes.  
•	Before you buy a textbook, check the library, ask upperclassmen who have already taken the class, hunt around- I rarely needed to buy a textbook and when I did it was because I wanted to keep a copy of the book myself.  
•	Exercise regularly- this will help keep you thinking clear and feeling well.  
•	If you are a graduate student- learn about the history of the graduate student union, and get involved when necessary. The benefits and good pay you get as a graduate student were not handed over nicely from the University- they were fought and negotiated for.  
•	University jobs aren’t too bad if you are an undergraduate and are easy to obtain. Great for some extra weekend or grocery money even if part time.  
•	Do old practice tests. All of them. Especially for math classes. Undergraduate math classes can suck- go to the tutoring offered for help.  
•	You can come back from failing a class- I failed a class freshman year and made up for it with a summer class. Better not to fail in the first place though! Don’t procrastinate!  
•	Summer classes are generally easier than normal classes and give you an excuse to hang out in Ann Arbor during the summer. Some summer classes are also harder than normal because so much material is crammed into a short time so just do your research with that.  
  
**What not to do**  
•	Do not cheat. The University is not tolerant to cheaters. You are just sabotaging yourself anyways if you cheat. It is honestly better to fail a class than to get caught cheating!  
•	Do not be racist. Try to learn about the variety of cultures and backgrounds present at U of M- you will only benefit from this. Do not be afraid to make friends with people that are very different from you! We are all wolverines anyways!   
•	Do not bother arguing with diag preachers- they want the negative attention; don’t indulge them.  
•	Do not argue excessively with the professor during lecture. Is your conversation with the Professor taking more than 3 minutes of class time? If it is, then it is a conversation for office hours, not the middle of lecture.  
  
**Where to go **  
•	Border to Border trail  
•	Barton Pond  
•	Some of my personal favorite cheap food is Backroom Pizza (1 dollar) south U pizza (~3 dollars) and Jerusalem Gardens (~6 dollars).   
•	Paint the rock!  
•	Yost arena. Ice skating is a great place for a date!  
•	Explore different University buildings- the architecture is awesome.  
•	UMMA- University of Michigan Museum of Art. If I recall correctly admission is free for students and they have rotating exhibits. Check out the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology too.  
•	Martha Cook- you will need to know an insider to let you in!  
•	The Arboretum! Goes without saying.  
•	Kayak or inner tube down Huron river.  
•	Kerrytown Farmers market and Sparrow market. There is more than just Zingerman’s over there!  
•	Zingerman’s.  
•	Hill Auditorium- find an excuse to check it out.  
•	PINBALL PETES  
•	The top of the Dental building.  
  
**Important for STEM/north campus people**  
•	Research professors before signing up for their class. I recommend www.koofers.com, Ratemyprofessor, and asking older students.  
•	Wolfram alpha can be accessed through mathematica- hit equal sign twice after starting a new line in mathematica. Mathematica is present on almost all UM computers including virtual sites.  
•	Do not cut corners on your assignments. You are sabotaging yourself. A monkey can google stuff to find the answer. If you memorize and understand things, you make yourself valuable. If you are a google machine, you will end up being slower than the people who actually learned things thoroughly.   
•	Study with people that want to succeed and do well. Sometimes your friends can be too distracting.  
•	Go somewhere quiet to get work done. Your dorm might not be that place.  

  
**Important especially for men going to U of M**  
Every guy coming to U of M should watch this video on consent: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQbei5JGiT8

If someone is too drunk to function, walk them home or call their friends. I have had to do this before. It is not only the right thing to do, it is the only thing to do. You don’t get an award for this, just be a decent human being. If someone is really drunk, CALL AN AMBULANCE. No one will get in trouble even if you are underage. Believe me, their parents would rather be upset about a kid that threw up then a kid with brain damage from alcohol poisoning. 

If you end up in a situation with the police, just cooperate- you might be surprised at how appreciative the police can be if you cooperate. 

Remember, one text, two text, no response- move on. Do not be creepy!


I hope that was helpful. There is more but that is a good start! Whatever you choose to do- pursue it to the fullest without doubt or fear. If you have some good advice, pass it on! Good luck and GO BLUE!

6x7hph,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/6x7hph/info_wifi_and_networks_at_um_what_devices_work/,"[INFO] WiFi and networks at U-M, what devices work and how to connect them!",21,11,2017-08-31 08:19:16,"**WIFI AND NETWORKS ARE DIFFERENT ON CAMPUS**

The university uses an enterprise WiFi network that is ***very*** different compared to how you connect things on a WiFi network at home. There is no ""single password"" to get onto WiFi like there is at home. Connection is based on your own individual username and password at the U. 

**WHAT WORKS? HOW DO I CONNECT?**

Because of this, some devices just won't work at U-M using WiFi. Many companies don't provide a way to configure the devices they make for enterprise WiFi networks. The devices that can connect need to be configured a little differently. Other devices, like gaming systems, need to be connected with an Ethernet cable, rather than WiFi.

If you're going to be living on campus this year - be sure to check out the [**ITS Device Compatibility Guide**](http://its.umich.edu/enterprise/wifi-networks/device-compatibility-guide) before you bring your technology to campus. It pretty clearly explains what works, what doesn't, and how to connect it.

**U-M WIFI SETUP TOOL**

If you have a device that is compatible to connect to campus WiFi (laptops/phones/tablets, etc.) be sure to [**check out the ITS website on how to connect to MWireless**](http://its.umich.edu/enterprise/wifi-networks/wifi/get-connected).

The best way to configure compatible WiFi devices is to [**use the WiFi setup tool**](http://its.umich.edu/wifisetuptool) to make sure computers and mobile devices are configured properly for use at U-M. You'll have to connect to MGuest first to use it."

If half of the people subscribed to this subreddit took 5 minutes and voted for our fellow wolverine Kenneth, he would win $25,000.00 from National Geographic for his research. Use the below link.
http://www.natgeochasinggenius.com/video/1497 

Allow me elaborate…

What are you talking about?
National Geographic is running a contest on its website from now until the 15th of September called ‘Chasing Genius.’ http://www.natgeochasinggenius.com/ 
Different people submit their ideas or research that can better the world in some way- be it helping to alleviate hunger, improving sustainability, or addressing global health concerns. Kenneth is a finalist, and is only a few hundred votes away from being one of the 4 winners. 

About the project: Kenneth’s research studies the plasma treatment of soybean seeds. I am using plasma here in the 4th-state-of-matter context, not the stuff in your blood. Treating seeds with plasma has been shown to have multiple benefits as already outlined by previous studies with other seeds. Soybeans are extremely versatile and have a high protein content making them suitable for feeding large populations. While the other projects in the running are also excellent, many of them may seem a bit difficult to implement. Kenneth’s project has multiple advantages: it has similar results with other crops, it is already being researched, it can be easily ported to real life, (farmers would be able to plant plasma treated seeds as normal) and it does not have an adverse health or environmental effect besides whatever energy is being used to generate the plasma. His project is above all, realistic and implementable. This similar recent study outlines the merit of plasma treating seeds: http://pubs.rsc.org/EN/content/articlehtml/2017/ra/c6ra24762h

About Kenneth: He grew up on a farm in Illinois, and is probably what you would see if you looked up ‘American guy’ in the dictionary. He loves Michigan football, he loves plasma science, and he is well known and respected in the nuclear engineering circles on campus. I can vouch for him in the sense that he works his ass off- he does his normal doctoral research during the day and then does his extra research on his own dollar/time after work just because he wants to and because he believes it will make a difference.

Why am I doing this: Kenneth is my best friend, and has had my back countless times during my 6 years at UM. He is a selfless person, and he is not the sort of person to go parading around about himself to win a contest- he also doesn’t lurk reddit like me. So I am paying him back for all his help and friendship over the years. 

How you can help: Go to the website and vote for Kenneth’s project, 'Plasma Treatment of Soybeans for Enhanced Physiological Development’ by signing up with any email and clicking on the gold star on his project. 
http://www.natgeochasinggenius.com/video/1497 
You can do this once per day, per email.

Thanks for reading- I know posts asking for things are annoying, but I had to try since he really is in the running to win money for his research. I will reply to questions about the research as best I can as I am also a plasma physicist from UM.

I don’t want to pay $10 to get campus food whose profit model is a captive audience when it doesn’t even hit my macros. I want to pay $3 to get a soylent one room over from me.

**The university is directly responsible for taking away the option that once existed**. Keep that in mind. I’m sure there is some way they could have smoothed a lot of this out, but somehow it has been a summer and half a semester, but still no Chez Betty.

I don’t care about the rules. I care that the single most convenient and affordable access to food and toiletries on campus (for me) was removed because of those rules, and that the university clearly hasn’t expedited the process of helping a student-led solution.

We give out $3000 grants to help students release stupid apps, but we can’t make it easier for them to get food.

I’d love to hear an update that says “hey, turns out Chez Betty is almost back” but damn, it’s halfway through the semester already. What process could possibly have to take this long when the store already functioned well (well enough)? It could only be paperwork, right? "

The Michigan Cycling team is a Club Sport who competes in the Midwest Collegiate Cycling Conference. Other teams in our conference include MSU, OSU, Notre Dame, Indiana, Wisconsin, Purdue, Illinois, Case Western, Louisville, Northwestern, Cincinatti, Marquette, Miami (NTM), and a bevy of other small schools. Our conference also features a few schools that consider cycling a varsity sport including Marian and Lindenwood.

The kit order is once again live and this year they're added a couple more options.
These are the same exact uniforms that the team will be racing in next spring. 

More information about the team can be found here: http://www.umcycling.org/

Prices do tend to run a bit high, but such is the nature of being a small fish in the big pond of paying university royalties and the like. Any proceeds go towards helping get team member's to races and most importantly nationals.

Also, we have switched vendors this year, and expect a massive step up in quality, as well as slightly reduced prices, so this is the year to order if you've been hesitant in the past!

The order closes on October 15th, and the kits will be delivered to you in mid-November. 
Please note that because this is a custom order, there is no returns.
Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.

Join other Team Internet members at the protest. Internet users outraged by top Verizon lawyer turned FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s plan to gut net neutrality are planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on Thursday, December 7th, one week before an expected vote at the FCC. Protesters will make it clear to members of Congress that the time is now to stand for net neutrality, not Verizon’s bottom line. 

**And please remember, this event is about protesting actions of Verizon executives, lobbyists and their supporters in Washington, not the employees at these stores.**

&gt; Chez Betty continues to work towards being open. Once again, we want to emphasize the Provost's office has been nothing except helpful during this process. We have a list of tasks to do and documents to acquire. The Chez Betty directors are slowly working through the list in our spare time. Due to a lot of (international) travel last semester, we had extremely limited time to work on Betty.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's a rough overview of where things stand:
&gt; 
&gt; Completed bits:  
&gt; - Founded a non-profit  
&gt; - Got a sales tax license  
&gt; - Formalized relationship with CSEG (the graduate student organization)  
&gt; - Formalized Standard Operating Procedure and money handling process  
&gt; - Cleared our menu  
&gt; - Passed a pre-opening health inspection.  
&gt; - Quoted insurance
&gt; 
&gt; Missing bits:  
&gt; - Finish out the an ITS review of our digital infrastructure to make sure we're not losing people's credit cards (under submission)  
&gt; - Buy liability insurance  
&gt; 
&gt; Once we've done that, we'll compile all the documentation and send it off to the Provost's office. We hope to do so within the next week or so. In the mean time, a list of signatures doesn't really accomplish anything.

Essentially, if you normally get more than $10000 in grants, you now get none of that, and you end up working completely for free. You could just live in the dorms like normal without working and you'd be in the same financial situation.

Let's not forget that this team was [projected to finish 6th in the Big Ten alone](https://www.si.com/college-basketball/2017/10/20/big-ten-preview-team-player-rankings-projections).  That the loss of DJ Wilson spelled doom for our chances this year.  But you know what?  We beat MSU twice.  We beat ohio state (No, I won't capitalize their name).  We beat Purdue in the B1G tournament.  And we won that B1G tournament.  This team went on a 14 game winning streak all the way to the National Championship game.  Jordan Poole hit a shot that will sit in my memory with Trey Burke's for the rest of my life  THAT is an amazing season.  I'm gonna miss the hell out of MAAR.  And if Mo decides to leave for the NBA, I'll be sad, but I'll get it.

That's less than half of Fall 2010's acceptance rate of 50.5%,122,15,2018-06-15 04:17:54,"Here's a link to the [article](http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2018/06/university_of_michigan_receive_8.html) on mlive. I know NeglectedWalrus already posted it but I found the acceptance rate particularly interesting. Going from a 50% acceptance rate to under 25% in just eight years seems absolutely crazy. It's understandable that admissions are getting more competitive since more and more students go to college each year, but the change is far greater than I would have guessed. 

This got me wondering how this compared to other universities' experiences. I don't mean to turn this into a numbers game for the sake of our egos but...

* MSU: Fall 2017 is 71.5%  and Fall 2010 was 70.0% ([souce](https://opb.msu.edu/functions/institution/documents/FallEnrollment.pdf))

* OSU: Fall 2017 is 43.8% and Fall 2010 was 61.9% ((2017 [source](http://enrollmentservices.osu.edu/report.pdf) and 2010 [source](http://www.acceptancerate.com/schools/ohio-state-university-main-campus))

* USC: Fall 2018 is 12.9% and Fall 2010 was 24.3% (2018 [source](http://www.uscannenbergmedia.com/2018/03/27/accepted-students-celebrate-getting-in-to-usc/) and 2010 [source](https://about.usc.edu/facts/facts2011/))

* UVA: Fall 2018 is 27.3% and Fall 2010 was 32.6% ([source](https://ias.virginia.edu/university-stats-facts/undergraduate-admissions))

* UCLA: Fall 2017 is 16.1% and Fall 2010 was 22.7% (2017 [source](https://www.admission.ucla.edu/Prospect/Adm_fr/Frosh_Prof17.htm) and 2010 [source](https://www.admission.ucla.edu/Prospect/Adm_fr/Frosh_Prof10.htm)

The comparison doesn't directly mean much, but I'd argue it shows Michigan's administration has done an excellent job continuing to improve the universities image and continuing to make it competitive.

And MSU appears as a bit of an outlier but it can be explained by their enrollment numbers. They've started accepting far more people each year to increase their enrollment size. I'm guessing they're trying to grow their class size quicker than they're trying to become more selective (something some would debate Michigan should do).

So, I move in on the 29th (for Honors) and classes start on the 4th. So, is welcome week all the way between move in and the day classes start? Do I have to stay on campus from the time that I move in or do I just go home and come back at a different date? I'm not really sure what exactly goes on during Welcome week- I know that it's mostly just a bunch of frat parties and getting drunk but I'm really not into any of that stuff and I'm probably not going to know anybody really well enough to do that kind of stuff/get into parties or whatever. Is it common for people to just leave/skip welcome week and all the parties and just go home (I live like 15 min away) or is it something that everybody on campus has to/should participate in? Like I know that I'm not the most outgoing/social person in the world but it can't be that every single student at the university walks around getting drunk and going to frat parties"

There are people of all years who have had it hard out here finding a group of friends.

It's really easy to feel left out when you're surrounded by a lot of people who are seemingly naturally making friends and meeting new people and getting invited to go out. Especially when you're making the effort to say hi to people in your dorm or talk to the people next to you in class or join clubs, and nothing really sticks.

Last year I saw a lot of people turn to Reddit about this struggle, and a lot are starting to again. It makes me really sad to see this and I want to put myself out there as someone to hang out with for anyone that's feeling lonely starting out the semester.

If you're looking for someone to talk to, DM me, tell me a little about yourself and we can meet up! I'm always down to get some bubble tea or study together.

About me: I'm a sophomore LSA student, major undecided. I like fashion, photography, and writing. So I'm also happy to go thrifting together, take some photos around Ann Arbor, or have a write-in. My other hobbies are all over the place and I love trying new stuff (lately I've been getting into painting, indie music, and fighting games, of all things). I live with and adore my cat, I'm in a LDR, and I'm really a talker above all else. I just like to get to know people and tell them about all of the above.

Last year I reached out to a few Michigan students on Reddit before who were looking for people to talk to or hang out with. A couple were really cool and I still talk to. I didn't hit it off with everyone and that's okay. If that happens I won't get offended or anything. I just want to put myself out there for anyone looking for a friend. :\~)"

I'm from the class of 2015, but I now work as a software developer in the automotive industry. I've been to the career fair twice as a recruiter and of course been on the otherside many times while I did my undergrad here. This fall career, I actually won't be there due to other work obligations. Apologies for the late post since I just learned it was this week.

Commons questions

**Couldn't I just apply Company's website? Is that the same thing instead of standing in line?**

No, though this generally depends because each and every company is different. 

Two reasons:

1. There is a seperate pipeline for new grads. Postions available for new grads may not be listed for on our website. The reason being is that we would get way too many resumes to review. It’s important for us to talk to you in person, so we can briefly see how well you communicate face-2-face and jot a couple notes on the back of your resume. 

2. Even if we listed that position on our webiste, we may not see your online application until weeks or months after you submitted it. If we talked to you in-person at the career fair, then you can at least be a candidate for an interview the next day or same week.  You apply online, then you will be competing with all online-applications for that position from all other universities. If you come to us at the career fair, then you will only be competing with students at your school for an interview slot. 

For some companies, applying on the website isn't different than talking to them at the career fair. 


**Any resume tips?**

Somewhere that states your year, major, and what you're looking for (internship/full-time). Usually the objective statement is a good place. Some students put US Citizen near all their contact info, which I appreciate. This helps me know whether sponsorship is required or not.

Get your resume reviewed career center. It might be too late as of now, but I'm sure you could ask upper-classmen to review or post around some online websites (w/ personal info blanked out) for feedback.

Different resumes geared towards different types of positions. 


**Does my major actually matter?**

Again, this depends on the company. Some of them have restrict HR requirements. 

For me, my role is to assess whether or not you have the confidence, skills, and potential to succeed. I don't care as long as I hear a compelling pitch. When I was a student, I had a buddy receive a legit engineering internship as a LSA freshmen. I know another person who worked as a full-stack developer right after graduation but was an international studies major. As a recruiter, we had a freshmen kinesiology student who used to repair/modify cars all the time with his dad. That same student actually performed better  than another intern who was a junior in MechE. 


sidenote: It's always a pet peeve of mine when I see freshmen ask about how to get internships, but other students tell them ""don't bother since its not expected"". I understand that this is to comfort them; however, it's a defeatist attitude and doesn't answer their questions. It's similar to asking how to get an A and getting ""C's get degrees, bro"" as a response. It's always at least good to try. 

**Search Strategy tips?**

Download the careerfair app or look at their website for the list of companies and positions available. Shotgunning aimlessly at random companies isn't time effective, unless you're trying to ""warm"" yourself up at a short line.


If your objective is to purely land an internship at a big name company, then pull up the [annual report](https://career.engin.umich.edu/about/salary-info/) and look at the ones with big feeder numbers. Ask around friends who got there about the process. 


If you run out of time, then collect some business cards, email the recruiter, thank them for coming. This part has actually gotten me 1 internship offer (after a couple rounds of interviews of course). 

**What should I wear?**

Something  professional, clean, presentable, fitted. But you don't need to look like you're in a fashion mag. 

I don't know much about women's wear, but as long as it doesn't look like you're ""going out"" you will be fine. 



For any other questions, just ask below.

I was deferred from UMich a few days ago, and I've been doing some research as to what I should do. On the UMich website, it says that the most successful students will only send in what is required (7th semester grades), but does not say anything about something like a letter of continued interest. However, on the sub wiki, it says that you can send a letter. Should I send a letter or will it hurt me? Also when would be an appropriate time to send the letter?

I’m a prospective student looking to apply to the CoE and was wondering if there is any precedent for double-majoring and receiving two BSEs?  I’m very interested in both NERS and MSE and have met with staff and faculty members from both departments and think Both would be great fits for me.  I’ve looked at the sample schedules and requirements for each department.  And, after taking out shared courses and gen ed requirements as well as taking out credits that I could transfer in (I’m taking dual enrollment classes at a couple local colleges and would be able to transfer in ~30 credits) , it looks like there would be just enough time in 8 semesters to fulfill all the requirements.  But, is that really feasible?  I would rather not spend a 5th year and would like to save my summers for research/internships, so I would have to fit in all those credits in the 8 semesters, which would fill up pretty much my entire schedule for all 4 years.  Thoughts?  Recommendations?  Has anybody here done or thought about doing a double major in the CoE?  And if so, did it completely ruin your ability to take other classes?"

I was admitted after a few days and have been super excited ever since. I filled out all the financial aid forms that I possibly could, started figuring out plans for the upcoming trip, until today. 

I received an email saying that my confirmation for the class I applied for was rescinded because they needed to make room for Earth Juniors and Seniors, but that I would be added to the waitlist, and I could enroll in earth 344. I’m pretty angry, to say the least, for a few reasons.

First and foremost, I have been admitted into the program for some time now and a sudden removal from the program is a massive inconvenience. At this point, I have missed out on a lot of valuable internships or job opportunities because I was under the impression that I would be stationed in Wyoming for a significant portion of the summer, and therefore unable to have an experience like an internship or full time job in relation to my field of interest. 

Second, by the end of this semester, I will be a junior by credits. I recognize that actual 3rd or 4th year students have less time at the university than me, but graduating early is something I’m considering because of financial reasons and simply finishing my requirements early.  Because of this, I feel I should be considered equally in admission to the program.

Overall, I feel this is pretty unprofessional from the Earth department and am looking for some advice for what to do in my situation. Is it too late to seek internships? Should I try to fight for my admission? This happened to another person in one of my classes, who said that his family had already booked a trip out to camp to come visit him, and that seems just ridiculous. Why wouldn’t they let us know that they might run out of space way earlier on? There’s nothing on the website that says you have to be a junior or senior to take the class, or that they have priority over me.

Any feedback would be appreciated. Thanks."

I can relate 100% to this and have been feeling very down lately. I'm a graduating senior and I really haven't enjoyed my time here, and as graduation creeps ever closer, I want to make at least a few good memories before my opportunity is gone for good. It's time for something to change, and I want to be a part of that to make it happen. 


Here's what I propose:

Everyone always gives the usual BS advice of ""go out, find a club you like, talk to random people at the bar, join a meetup group"", etc. I know you mean well and that these things might have worked for you, truly, no hard feelings, but a lot of you struggle to realize just how daunting this is to most of us. This is the equivalent of throwing someone in the deep end of a pool and expecting them to swim. Most people might be able to learn how to swim that way, but others will drown. I, for one, would be much more comfortable going out and taking risks and doing things in a group, but since I have no one to go with, it's a catch 22, and once you get stuck in this pattern, it's hard to get out.

I feel like if there was a dedicated and organized group to go and do these things in, people would be more willing to take that risk to go and try new things and meet new people. Also, since this group's purpose will be to make lonely people more comfortable and feel accepted, people will come in knowing they have something big in common with everyone there. We all have similar life experiences, and will be more comfortable opening up and talking to each other about it, since we know that the other people will be more likely to ""get it"". There will be no need to awkwardly explain how you have no friends, hoping that the other people treat you normally and don't throw you a pity party. There's no shame in it, no ""what if they think I'm weird"" or ""I have nothing in common with these people"" or ""these people have known each other for years, I don't belong here"" because everyone's guaranteed to be in the same boat, there's no guessing factor. 

As for the group's activities, we can do literally anything and everything. Wanna go get wasted at Charley's? Hell yeah, let's do it! Wanna catch up on Game of Thrones before the new season in April? Movie night! Wanna go see that cool new museum that they've been doing construction on for the last 4 years? Let's go! Got a restaurant you want to try? Let's get some grub!

I'm not promising that it won't be awkward at times, or that everything will be perfectly organized, but I am willing to make the effort to make it work. I may not be brave enough to go out and do these things on my own, but I'm willing to take the risk to put it out here for anyone to see and join me. I really believe that if we get a solid group together, we can change our lives for the better and make it easier for us to follow the stereotypical advice that everyone gives us. Who knows, we might even become friends for life! Wouldn't that be cool?"

In the last few weeks, I have seen a frightening amount of posts related to mental health issues, anxiety issues, loneliness, etc, than I ever have before. This is frankly a very disturbing trend and I'm worried about my fellow wolverines. As someone who also deals with anxiety issues and has gotten help, Reddit is definitely not the first place people should go when they are struggling with these issues. Anonymous people online can only do so much and reading text off a screen is nowhere near as good as talking face-to-face to another human being who is willing to listen to you. With this in mind, I made this post because I have a few suggestions that I hope the mods will take into consideration to make this sub a more helpful place for people struggling with mental health issues.

I believe this sub could benefit from two additions that can help students:

1. There should be a tab, or a hyperlink listed under the ""useful links"" tab, in the sidebar with links to various websites and resources on campus for students suffering from mental health issues. I think this is a no-brainer and if only a fraction of the people who visit this sub even notice that tab, it's still better than not having it there at all. 

2. There should be a weekly sticky thread for people to vent, get certain thoughts off their chest or ask for help. This sticky thread would provide a place for students to talk to each other and provide advice or support and show people that they're not alone when it comes to the issues they're facing. It could also serve a as a way to advertise offline meetups for students who want to make friends or who struggle with social anxiety.

I (freshman F) have struggled with anxiety for pretty much my whole life but, since December, it has grown progressively worse. I have difficulty even leaving my room to do anything except go to class - this means that I hardly eat in the cafeteria, go out with people, etc. I don't really even know if I have close friends and I feel painfully alone. I've tried joining clubs and all, but nothing really seems to fill the void. Sororities and parties frighten me, so those are out of the question. It's gotten to a point where I've started skipping class from time to time (something which I hate, as my academics are all that I have anymore) because I get so anxious leaving my room that I can burst into tears at random.

Does anyone have any advice? I've already informed my professors of the situation and they are very understanding. I just don't know what to do about my social situation and I'm getting desperate."

I know many of you are super *duper* stressed for exams. It may feel like studying is the only path to maintaining that scholarship, or to salvaging the GPA you’re holding together with duct tape and prayers. Some days feel impossible, some hurdles insurmountable. I gotchu. We’ve all been there.

*But **your** mental and physical health is more important than all of that.*

If you have time, do your best to take a break.

* Go on a walk through the diag with some earbuds in and listen to your favorite song.

* If you’re in your dorm/apartment, try to open a window and get some fresh air circulating.

* Stand up and stretch for a few minutes, or take a lap around the UGLi/Dude to get that blood pumping just a bit.

* Grab a snack and top off your water bottle.

* If you’re so inclined, take a short nap in the grass between lecture recordings.

Trust me, it’ll feel nice to find a change of pace, however brief, and your brain will thank you.

Grades are important, but **you** are even more-so. Live your best life. Have no regrets.

I may not know too many of y’all, but I still believe in each and every one of you. We’ll get through this together. We are all Wolverines. We all belong here.

I decided to go to UMich and it was the perfect place for me. Now, I'm finishing up my sophomore year and I am really sad to go home. There is something so special about going to school here; it was my dream school, after all. So for all you rising freshmen, enjoy every moment.

Basically, I’m from a low income family and college would be very out of reach for me without substantial aid. When I first got my aid report back, it was just federal government grants and loans that didn’t really cover as much as i needed at all.

I can't count how many times I walk into MOJO, South Quad, or North Quad during lunch rush hour and see tons of students taking up tables and seats with their laptops and books, with no food anywhere in sight.

Btw, these numbers specifically are not ""amount of people surveyed"".

This doesn't include Data Science which shares a bulk of similar requirements to CS, 8 grads =&gt; 50 grads.

I believe most of these increases are due to LSA students switching to CS  [since freshmen entering 2013/2014 is around the same](https://ro.umich.edu/reports/enrollment)

VACCINATE YOUR GODDAMN KIDS. 

Greetings, U-M Ann Arbor students (and identified family), faculty and staff,

An international visitor to the U-M Ann Arbor campus – who has now returned home  – was confirmed today as having measles.

**Anyone who visited the following campus locations on these dates should monitor themselves for rash with fever or other symptoms consistent with measles over the next couple of weeks**:

* Intramural Sports Building on April 1, 3 and 4
* North Quad Complex on April 3
* Angell Hall Courtyard Computing Site (the Fishbowl) on April 4 and 5   

Exposure may have also occurred in off-campus locations. For details see [https://www.washtenaw.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=513](https://www.washtenaw.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=513)

Measles is a highly contagious rash illness caused by a virus. Symptoms typically begin with high fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. A rash breaks out 3 to 5 days after symptoms begin.  If you develop measles symptoms, especially rash and fever:

* Contact a health care provider as soon as possible. Currently enrolled students on the Ann Arbor campus may call UHS at 734-764-8320, day or night.
* Do not expose others, for example by riding a bus or socializing.

For prevention, make sure you are vaccinated. MMR is a recommended childhood vaccine, and two doses provide about 97% protection against measles. You are considered immune to measles if you received two MMR doses. You’re also considered immune if you had measles or were born before 1957.

You can also protect yourself and others from measles and other respiratory infections by following these steps:

* Cover your cough and clean your hands frequently
* Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands
* Avoid sharing saliva, e.g. sharing cups and eating utensils, and kissing

- Second floor of the stack (enter through the back under the big overhand) by the back windows, or if it’s busy during finals, the first floor down the tiny stairs in the middle of the bookshelves in the women’s studies section.

- chemistry building atrium late at night on weekends

- Mason hall classrooms! All the free plugs and desks you could ever hope for, and usually open pretty late!

- Similarly, many Hutchins (law quad) lecture halls don’t lock...ever....

- the sitting spaces on the second floor of UMMA don’t have plugs, but offer peace and quiet for reading 

- need a computer? There’s a lab in the basement of the League that’s almost never busy

- Second floor Tappan art library, back between the bookshelves, are big tables that can fit 6-8 people

- Many of the buildings around campus, such as the bell tower, require codes even with an Mcard. I’m not going to post the codes here, but many times they correlate with when the building was constructed *hint hint* and the bell tower classrooms are an AMAZING spot on the weekend during finals. (A Cappella groups practice in the classrooms at night, so if you have any friends in any of those clubs, they probably know the code)

- Not a secret spot, but my favorite hack of all: ANYONE can reserve the private rooms in the ugli. Come up with a convincing acronym to reserve it under and early in the semester book several spots during midterms/finals and you and all of your friends will have a nice private room no one can kick you out of!"

We want you to know that your personal health and well-being are our highest priorities.  
 
We’ve heard your concerns about confidentiality and cost associated with testing for sexually transmitted infections and the worry that these concerns may result in barriers for some students seeking important preventive health-care services at UHS. 
 
After careful consideration we are modifying the policy that was put into effect in July to bill students’ health care insurance plans for all diagnostic testing services, including STI testing.  
 
Effective today, UHS will cover, from the student health service fee, the cost of testing for sexually transmitted infections. Under the policy we will continue to bill insurance plans for other necessary testing and services.
 
You have helped us understand just how important it is to maintain confidentiality in this process all the way through how those tests are paid for. We would never want the payment process for these important medical tests to stand in the way of any student accessing important medical services or testing.
 
We want every student to have access to all forms of health care they may need – from flu shots and mental health counseling to eye exams and contraception services or STI testing – at a cost that is reasonable.
 
The good news is that since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, nearly all students who come to study on the Ann Arbor campus have health care insurance. In addition, the on-campus location of UHS makes health care accessible by a short walk or bus ride for most students.
 
Paying for health care is an ongoing issue that our society continues to explore and at UHS we work hard to leverage all available sources of funding – including health care insurance plans – in order to keep the student health service fee as low as possible. There was no increase in that fee this year.
 
It’s also important to know that UHS has long had in place programs to help students pay for their health care and to keep billing confidential. Addressing a student’s health needs has always been our No. 1 priority. Paying for that care takes many forms – including providing care at no cost for students who may not have access to appropriate resources.
 
We want to personally thank the many students who have helped us understand just how important this topic is. We’ve heard you and we are changing our billing process because of the concerns you have raised directly with us, the UHS staff and other campus leaders.

djrz2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/djrz2p/the_secret_society_within_the_university_of/,"The ""Secret Society"" within The University of Michigan",118,25,2019-10-18 11:51:29,"I figured I would do a short writeup on this, as in my time at the University of Michigan it seemed that a lot of people, students and staff alike, were unaware of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Order of Angell, formerly (and perhaps more often) known as ""**Michigamua**"", is an odd, secret society that exists at the University of Michigan. The organization began in 1902, and, by all accounts, has continued every year since then - only allowing around 25 students in per year (though how accurate this figure is is unknown). Potential members are contacted privately, but casually, often through connections such as fellow students or staff. They're instructed to meet with some of the other members, and to consider joining. These members are typically students with some prominence or leadership roles- Football Quarterbacks, Hockey Captains, Fraternity/Organization leaders, sons and daughters of prominent figures, even former president (and football player) Gerald Ford was known to be a member. These students are often contacted in their junior year- to become a part of the Order for their Senior year (though how involvement persists after graduation is something of a mystery).  

&amp;#x200B;

Their intended purpose is unknown. Initially, in the few releases of information they would give, they would simply say something among the lines of ""Connect Proven, Diverse Leaders"", to ""Fight like hell for Michigan"", or to otherwise serve as leaders in the University. Despite this, there are sparse if *any* known events, actions, or initiatives directly backed by The Order of Angell, making their true purpose a bit of a mystery. 

&amp;#x200B;

At some point in the 1970s, it was determined that the group had started performing ""Rituals"", perhaps similar to those performed by modern Freemasons (think less sacrificing lambs and more performing theatrical performances in somewhat silly outfits).  Details on this are unfortunately also somewhat unknown, but their official(?) website and other sources state that this had a Native American bend to it, which was found to be controversial (read: racist), leading to the name change from Michigamua to The Order of Angell. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are some accounts of an internal mascot of a Wolf, though I had some trouble substantiating this. 

&amp;#x200B;

That about all there is to it. While ""spooky"", in these situations the most boring and mundane answer is often the correct one. I would theorize that The Order of Angell, for the most part, is largely simply a tradition bound organization for wealthy, well-connected, and/or typically ""elite"" students within the University of Michigan to talk and 'network' and generally organize stances on various topics within the University of Michigan and surrounding areas. I could be jaded and wrong, but who knows. 

&amp;#x200B;

It should also be noted that the group went through some significant rebranding lately. While it was more of a ""secret society"", it's now rather public if you know where to look- even offering an entire members list. That being said, it still seems like it ""prefers"" a low-profile, and it's system of only recruiting 25 ""elite"" students every year is still particular.

Again, by all accounts it's probably just an organization that originally started so wealthy elite white students could hang out and now only continues for tradition, with just ""networking"" and making sure major groups have roughly the same public stances on things. So don't go emailing down people or anything. But by all means feel free to discuss!"

I am a laboratory technician studying DNA double strand break repair in yeast at the BSRB. I am currently working on data for a publication and I would love some help. Activities would include general lab duties such as streaking plates, washing glassware and making reagents but I can also offer training and experience in many current laboratory techniques such as droplet digital PCR, next generation library preparation and more. I also have some ideas for an independent project that you can work on. 

I’m looking for a motivated undergrad in a STEM major that can put in around 10 hours a week, about 2 hours a day. I would also prefer someone who knows they will be in AA over the summer to continue volunteering. Anyone interested can PM me and I will put you in contact with my PI. Thank you!"

I’m about to graduate with my masters of social work and want to go down the data science route to help use data to solve social problems and develop better therapeutic interventions as well as boost my salary. 


From what I can see online, the MADS program is 34 credits (1 year) taken online and the MSI program is 48 credits (2 years) taken in person. The masters in data science through the stats department looks like it has more prereqs. 


Is the MSI program just broader? Does it look better to employers to take one of these programs over the other? If I did the MADS, will I be able to work as a data scientist? I’m skeptical due its online and shorter nature."

I’m a high school senior and I just can’t make up my mind on where to go to college. I’ve been accepted into UofM and I’m really excited about it! I find it hard to turn down the offer because it’s so prestigious, but I know at the end of the day I can’t choose a school just for its name recognition. I’m attending a Campus Day next month, I’ve been lurking here for a few weeks, and overall I’m just very conflicted.

I wanted to know if anyone is willing to share their day-to-day lives and their overall thoughts on UMich. Some things I’m particularly concerned about are housing, food, financial aid, and academic rigor. That being said, I’m cool with hearing about really anything, whatever people are comfortable sharing.

Some other notes and concerns:

. **I’m an Ann Arbor native** (literally born at the uofm children’s hospital lmao). I’m already aware of the general culture and feel of the city.

. I’m curious to know why you guys chose UofM out of your other options. Are you happy with your decision?

. I was accepted into Stamps for the Art &amp; Design BFA. If anyone is in this program or is involved with Stamps in any way, I would *love* to hear about it. I’m conflicted about uofm because I want to emphasize in graphic design (looking to be an art director of some sort). I fear that Stamps’ mixed curriculum won’t translate into the same qualifications or career prospects as a standard graphic design BFA, and not for the better. If anyone’s pursuing a Stamps degree, I’d love to hear about your career aspirations and goals.

. Kind of interested in a dual degree with Ross, but I didn’t apply as a dual applicant (I couldn’t do both before the EA deadline) and I fear I’ve missed my chance. Has anyone started a dual degree after the fact? I know it’s possible, but has anyone actually succeeded? Would I even have a chance at Ross when business is only a secondary (and not very well-formed) interest of mine?

If anyone has anything to share, that would be extremely helpful! I am very indecisive."

I'm a part of UM's Tech for Social Good org--we were brainstorming ways to inject some wholesome / positive vibes during this difficult time and came up with the idea of a [whiteboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1f0z-ntqFmzfkrLP6UwXyKI5myC3Tp00p8ehDQmOLdJM/) where students can respond to prompts that'll (hopefully) spark some positive reflection + others can learn about the happenings/small victories of fellow campus mates while we're physically distant.

If you're posting on the whiteboard, please be mindful of others' postings (e.g., don't make your post-it overly large)!

I wanted to give a distress signal and ask for some general advice towards the EECS 203 tests. 

Background info on me: Ive never really had to study in order to get good grades in all of my classes up until EECS203. I seriously bombed the first midterm, and now I’m quite anxious of failing the class and it is impacting my daily hw performance.

I thought I’d ask, how can I pass a 203 midterm if I know literally nothing about what’s going on in the class right now? Luckily the test got pushed back so I get more time to prepare, but what do I need to start doing in order to understanding the class, the material, and getting comfortable enough with said material in order to pass an exam?

Tonight is the final turn for Collegefootball Risk. We're currently in [first place](https://imgur.com/a/ECbcjiM) with 22 territories. OSU is in second with 21 territories, Wisconsin and Georgia Tech are tied for 3rd with 17 territories. At this point it's pretty much a head to head battle with OSU for the win. Whoever has the most territories at 11:01PM tonight is declared the winner. 

We **NEED** to maximize our player count to increase our odds of winning tonight. If you haven't played yet, **please** consider taking the 30 seconds it takes to log a move for the first time. **Instructions are below for new players**. If you have played before, then we urge you to return just one more time for this final roll.

To play, follow these simple steps:

*     Connect your Reddit account to collegefootballrisk.com and choose Michigan as your team
*     Go to michigancfbrisk.com to get orders that are part of our team strategy determined daily by our mods and players on our vetted discord 
*     Follow the link back to collegefootballrisk.com and input your orders in the actions menu at the bottom of the page


Here's how College Football Risk works: Each day, players input an ""action"" on behalf of their team to defend a territory their team currently holds, or attack one their team borders. It takes just one click to input the action, and it can be changed throughout the day. At 11 pm EDT, all the actions are finalized and put at the mercy of the random number generator to see which team wins a territory based on the odds accumulated by the number of players inputting moves (and weighted by player stars accumulated throughout gameplay)."

I just found out today that UM has opened applications for students who were affected financially from COVID-19, as permitted from the CARES Act. Funding comes from the Federal Government and is dispersed by the University. One can apply for any reason if affected by the pandemic, including ""medical expenses, travel, housing, and computing/technology expenses"". 

To do so, you have to first make sure you have a FAFSA on file. If you don't, Financial Aid recommends that you complete ""the FAFSA for COVID-19 Application (FCOVIS) listed as a required document on your Wolverine Access portal"".

To access the actual COVID-19 funding, go to Wolverine Access &gt; Financial Aid Information &gt; Select Aid Year 2020 &gt; Documentation/Review &gt; Documents &gt; Complete and submit ""COVID-19 Emergency Application"". You may also have to complete ""FAFSA For COVID-19 Application"", but if you already have a FAFSA on file, you do not. You may also want to complete ""COVID-19 App Documentation"" to provide proof of some of your expenses, though it is not mandatory.

Best of luck!"
gkvx6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/gkvx6b/i_really_dont_feel_like_i_belong_here/,I really don't feel like I belong here,6,48,2020-05-16 07:55:13,"This isn't a ""Ohh I can't make As, only Bs, this school isn't for men"" post. I really don't feel like I should be here.

&amp;#x200B;

I applied for this school in particular for an admiringly stupid reason that ended up falling through spectacularly, when I got here I quickly realized also that, mayyybee coming here when I felt completely burnt out and tired of trying for little good that came out of my efforts wasn't a good idea. I've been trying to convince myself that ""if I just get through college and do well, I'll be home free!"" I've made such promises to myself before that did not come true, so it's a little hard to keep making such promises. And I don't do well in my classes, I actually failed my CS class (280) not a good sign. Due to burn out / test anxiety. I feel I can problem solve well when my brain is fully functional which is rare cause burn out. I got a C in math 115. for the same combo of reasons. Hoping Honors Calc 2's different format will help me do better lol

&amp;#x200B;

Thing is, I might have gotten good grades in my programming CS classes in community college, but a lot of those classes were complete jokes. Projects were just about doing one function each project. Despite having credit for EECS 183, I needed to take it cause 280 downright scared me due to not being adequately prepared. The As I got in many classes took so little effort (C# class was literally just, add an extra line of code to this given file and submit it). Final was about making this huge project we were not properly trained to do. I failed that but because my other stuff was good I got an A in that class. Java classes were about doing fairly simple functions each week. One weird crazy challenging assignment, which I failed and got shamed by teacher for. Midterm / final was ""Answer super specific questions about the Java language despite having not studied it"". Other classes were literally ""Follow this step by step guide to do a thing using the textbook"" tedious but easy as heck.

&amp;#x200B;

All of these were the online versions of classes , I'm guessing in person classes were hella different from online and are what Michigan evaluated and judged my success based on. I didn't know Michigan disapproved online classes before applying.  This is the heart of why I don't feel I belong here - my grades feel hella inflated and I don't think I really clear the Michigan bar, not even close.

&amp;#x200B;

I saw my essay scores for my admission application . They were like, 1.5 or 2 / 5. This makes me really feel like my race (Hispanic) is a huge part of what got me in. That and inflated grades. I haven't seen too many Hispanics on campus,  Sorry that that seems harsh on myself but yeah

&amp;#x200B;

Also I culturally just don't fit in here. Maybe it's just being a lot older, but I feel like I won't find people who I would get close to because everyone I talk to, I feel this weird barrier of perspective sort of separate us. I can have fun in the anime club but it just feels like I'm sorta separated from them in a hard to explain way. It's not just me going ""Baghh stupid kids"" I see them as equals, but just, time has made them innately unrelatable. Not a fan of sports, luckily doesn't seem to matter here but the ""geek culture here is . . .stressed out EECS kids with little free time, including me lol. Graduates are closer to my age, but graduate life seems so different from undergrads, Not sure how many transfers would be any closer to my age. Never had time to go to transfer events due to burn out making me slow. Also I like having deep convos but the people I've tried to talk to seem so absorbed in their own opinion, they can't even consider what I'm saying / why. Not trying to change their opinion just want an honest conversation instead of feeling I'm being ""sold"" the ""woke""/ PC opinions without being listened to in return. . And I'm not super in tune with Spanish culture, or interested frankly so it's not as easy as ""Oh just find the other Spanish kids""

So to summarize, I feel like I got in with inflated grades, essays that got scored poorly, feel like I got accepted to boost race stats, find it difficult to make friends due to age / culture difference . Find classes difficult

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry fo the long post, feel absolutely free to give your opinions, even harsh ones / honest. I kinda wish it was easier to transfer but I have the best finned deal here for being 24 + (independent). Also classes don't transfer easily ETC.

I'm also international too. As I'm looking back into my freshman year, honestly it was such an amazing experience(apart from the corona shitshow). I made a lot of friends, met some cool people, and generally just had a blast.
Even then, there is one thing I really regret not doing: being active around campus. I wasn't involved in any student orgs or clubs and I regret it so much now. I was getting good grades and thought that was it but man I could have had even better time while also being part of something, self-exploring, and just improving as a person. I was there for both festifall and winterfest and signed up for a bunch of stuff but never actually showed up. I want to change that this year(if the campus opens). So those people who figured it out, any advice and tips would be appreciated!"

Staying home will save me a ton of money, especially with all online classes, but I kinda just want to stay on campus (either dorm or sublet or lease) just so I’m with a community.

No one is going to trade their central campus/hill contract for your north campus contract.  

I lived in Bursley my freshman year and the north campus dorms truly are an inferior experience for freshmen.  Freshmen engineers generally only have one or two north campus classes a semester, and even the SMTD/Stamps people are generally willing to commute instead of living on north.  Trading a central campus contract for a north campus contract is an unequal trade.  

My advice is to make the best of your situation and make quality friends across both campuses.  Meet the people in your hall/house and join a frat or a club.

If you’re really dead set on switching you do have a few options.  First, there are usually a few vacant spots in East Quad reserved for athletes.  These spots usually aren’t all taken, so there’s a waitlist you can get on to transfer there.  A person in my hall did this my freshman year.  

Second, you could include something of value in your trade offer to make it a fair deal.  Officially, the university does not allow you buy room trades with other students.  However, there is no real way to enforce this rule, and I know of at least one student who successfully did this.  Decide for yourself if this is something you’re morally ok with and how much you think living on central is really worth over north.  

Finally, if you happen to live in 6 Douglas in Bursley, you could possibly get a transfer by telling the university you’re uncomfortable living at the site of a [double homicide in 1981](https://www.michigandaily.com/content/tragedy-bursley).  I didn’t consider it worth the trouble, but I’ve heard stories from other people living there that people were able to transfer out that way.

Edit: formatting

Edit 2: apparently there have been people who got caught accepting money for room swaps and had their contracts canceled.  Someone else suggested declining your dorm contract and getting a central campus apartment if you really want to get off of north"

&gt;I have received several emails about ""retaliation"". This is a very understandable concern of anyone in the circumstances, so I will try to be as clear as possible about it. First, freedom of speech and peaceful protest are fundamental rights and ChE will not take any actions (or tolerate any by ChE faculty or staff) against anyone for exercising these rights. Second, work stoppage is a legal matter, and consequences may be dictated by university or governmental policies beyond the authority of ChE. There is a general consensus among ChE faculty that individual instructors should take no further action beyond these policies based on a GSI's decision to participate in the strike. Faculty are instructed that they may impose no additional penalties of any sort on striking GSIs. Similarly, we wish to assure all graduate students that their status in the ChE graduate program will not be adversely affected by strike participation.

We write at the end of a week of labor action by the Graduate Employees’ Organization (GEO). Regardless of whether or not you participated in this action, we have sought to provide you with information by publishing our proposal to GEO, and by explaining that we believe that some topics cannot be the subject of labor negotiation because they require university-wide engagement.  Many voices, including mine, have reiterated the continuing value of your diverse contributions to our university community.

As we all take a moment to reflect this weekend, and prepare for the next, I renew my respect for your activism, and for your protest. I look forward to engaging with your protests as students in parallel with your employment concerns.

To that end, we wish to meet graduate students’ interests by listening, engaging and finding common ground and ask that you do the same.  We have been and would like to continue to meet and talk with GEO’s representatives about how to resolve the strike, and how our community can come together to lead a path forward.  Our negotiating team reached out to GEO’s president today inviting a meeting. The University’s representatives are on standby, willing to meet with GEO’s representatives this weekend.

We understand that GEO is considering whether to continue the strike.  We hope that you will encourage the union’s membership to return to the classroom so that we may continue to serve our students and deliver the high quality instruction that we care so deeply about.  We encourage everyone to make their voices heard.

We recognize that we need to continue, and enable more work to be done on these issues that matter to our entire community - faculty, staff, students, parents and alumni. We understand that many of the issues deserve and warrant on-going and continuing efforts with many stakeholders, diverse perspectives, and multiple interests.

As such, and separate from negotiations with GEO, we are working to continue addressing vital health and safety concerns during these very challenging times, and to provide greater communication on the steps the University has already taken.  These conversations must involve all of the members of our community;  please be assured we are committed to engaging in these discussions now and in the future.

While they can’t be resolved by union negotiations, we are committed to addressing policing concerns in separate venues.  To be a leader in this critical space, the University of Michigan must include numerous and varied voices, including graduate students;  and work thoughtfully and deliberately to achieve impactful outcomes. Whether the strike continues or not, and we hope it does not for the sake of our entire community, we will continue those efforts.

University and Division of Public Safety and Security (DPSS) leaders remain open to discussing these vital issues with members of the university community. The safety and security of our large campus requires a security unit that is sensitive to the unique needs of the university community.  DPSS has longstanding prevention and education programs that are essential to its daily work, with presentations and training frequently requested within our community.  These include self-defense workshops; active attacker Run, Hide, Fight training; See Something? Say Something training; and workplace and classroom violence de-escalation presentations. 

For those who might be interested, the DPSS Student Advisory Board is continuing its efforts to promote  effective and impactful ways for students to participate in shaping campus safety. Applications should be submitted by the end of September, but rolling applications will be accepted throughout the year. If you are interested in joining, fill out this online application.

I am deeply concerned to see our community so fractured, and I hear the frustration and anger of many graduate students.  You are essential members of the University of Michigan community, who have a very special, important and time-honored role -- as students and as partners in teaching and research.  I  look forward to working together to address concerns and to heal our community.

Best,

You may have noticed that the city has installed temporary bike lanes throughout downtown to give pedestrians and cyclists more space to social distance as well as improving our collective safety and well being.

Ann Arbor has set up this survey to give your feedback. What should be improved? Should these changes be made permanent? (I think so, they greatly increase cyclist and pedestrian safety and act as a road-diet for downtown streets, limiting people trying to speed and allowing everyone to enjoy the city with less fear of death and busy traffic.)

Currently the top demographic for feedback is the $100,000-$149,999 income bracket, which isn't representative of the student perspective at all. Let them know what you think!"

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**: Looking to get an internship for May 2021 - August 2021, should I be applying now?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm rather new to all this internship stuff and being an international student, I'm quite oblivious to the whole internship application process (back in my home country, there aren't really internships as readily available to college students compared to the US). More specifically, I'm trying to see how I should prepare and if I'm behind in the Computer Science realm of internships. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just started off my junior year.

I've completed: EECS 183, EECS 203, EECS 280, EECS 281.

I'm currently taking: EECS 370, EECS 376.

&amp;#x200B;

One of my friends has already messaged me about how I'm doing with internships and if I've applied already. To be completely honest, I haven't really put much thought into it right now. I do have a sample resume ready, but I do not have my LinkedIn or Handshake profiles setup. I've heard quite a lot about engineering fairs, but this semester is particularly different as I saw that everything is online. 

&amp;#x200B;

**I'm looking to hopefully land an internship for May 2021 - August 2021.** Does the internship application process for that date range start this early? Since my friend asked how I was doing in terms of intership stuff, I assumed that the Spring 2021 internship process has already started, or is he asking for my prep regarding December 2020 internships?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm quite lost on this topic of CS internship and I'd appreciate some resources or advice that you could give me! Am I late to the process and should I be setting up my accounts and start applying for internships already? Aside from the courses at UM, I don't really have much else under my belt (no personal projects), is this a crucial factor for interships?

A commenter brought this up in another thread, and my older friend and I discussed this yesterday.

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of us undergrads feel understandab;y worried of the extremes of the GEO\\s demands, but what we need to understand is this is necessary. What the GEO ultimately will be happy is with the 80 percent of their demands being met, preferrably more I'm sure but the point is:

&amp;#x200B;

With negotiation, you have to aim high because the people with power will ultimately, through negotiations force the GEO to accept less than 100 percent, which is why their 100 percent needs to be higher, so that the 80 percent is ultimately what they are happy with, and what we are happy with.

I took 280 + 203 this past spring term, and it a really tough experience. After trying to reach out to others taking the courses, and getting no responses, it was hard to make friends/connections. I worked through everything alone (I know in retrospect that’s sort of a good thing, being independent for projects etc.) and imposter syndrome was through the roof (looking @ Piazza, I was constantly reminded that there was always someone ahead of me on projects, exam prep, etc. and it felt like everyone else understood the material I wasn’t getting).

I guess going into 281, this experience kinda scarred me. I’m having the same issues with imposter syndrome, having trouble meeting people, feeling isolated and overwhelmed. I definitely learn better in an in-person environment, and I just don’t think I’m ready to go through this again (so soon). Thinking about p1 is giving me major anxiety, and I’d rather take this semester to focus on building up a stable online work ethic/schedule and learning how to reach out to people.

However, I don’t know what to fill that 4-credit gap with. From a quick glance, pretty much every other EECS course I could take this semester is filled up. I’m taking the calc prereq right now, but I think I might feel even more “behind” if I switch 281 for a non-coding related course to take in the meantime. Any suggestions? If I switch to a distribution req class instead, is there anything I can do in the meantime to feel more prepared for when I take 281 during winter semester?"

Yet, that is a complete joke; the midterm has nothing to do with that. The difficulty is way harder than what instructor taught during lectures, and it tests knowledge way beyond the purview of lecture notes.

Hello EECS students,

The department would like to inform you about two important policy updates:

1. As an addendum to the policy for Winter 2020: no attempts in Spring, Summer, or Fall 2020 terms will count against the two-take limit for EECS 203, EECS 280, or EECS 281.

2. EECS 281's enforced prerequisites of a C or better in EECS 203 and 280 will remain enforced, but the requirement that the two grades average to a 2.5 or better will be moved to an advisory prerequisite, beginning in the Winter 2021 term. It is still strongly recommended that you achieve the 2.5 average between the two prereq grades before moving on. If you would like help in determining whether or not you should continue on to EECS 281, please schedule an advising appointment to discuss your situation with an advisor.

If you have questions, please feel free to contact us through the CSE Peer Advisor Piazza or by sending an email to CSE Advising at ugadmin@eecs.umich.edu.

jvg5vw,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/jvg5vw/dear_professors/,Dear Professors...,585,33,2020-11-16 13:57:47,"My grandmother passed away one week ago. You know that, of course, because I emailed you saying so. What you might not know is how much your responses meant to me.

On Tuesday morning, I logged onto a Zoom call with my grandma and a few family members. I thought it was just to say hello. The call dropped shortly after. She passed away.

I cried for two hours straight. Then, I pulled myself together and went to class. I even used the ""raise your hand"" feature and chipped in during discussion. You wouldn't have known anything was wrong. Halfway through, I muted myself, turned off my video, and cried again.

I thought about not emailing you. I'm aware that ""my grandma died"" is a classic excuse. We aren't having a funeral right now because of COVID-19, so I don't have proof. I told you that. Each one of you told me I didn't need it. You said to take my time to process and heal. There is no set timetable for healing, but I think you knew that, too.

You didn't know, however, that ever since my mother's cancer diagnosis during my freshman year, my biggest fear has been losing my loved ones. COVID-19 hasn't helped, especially with having older, high-risk parents (and being high-risk with an autoimmune disease myself). There have been nights when I've cried myself to sleep thinking about it and all the other stresses of the world. 

You can imagine my state of mind, then, when I found out my grandma was admitted to the hospital and passed away shortly after. My grandmother had (falsely) tested negative when we found out she may have been exposed to the virus. It didn't seem fair, as we had very much tried to be careful since March. Of course, I still had classes and homework. I tried to push away the harsh realities and dedicate myself to my studies. 

But it was, and has been, hard. I haven't been able to see family because they are in quarantine. My dad, who was the one caring for my grandma, is isolating and showing COVID-19 symptoms himself. I don't know what's going to happen for the holidays, nor do I even look forward to them anymore. I feel no motivation to get out of bed. The one time I did leave the house to get a book from Shapiro, I teared up on the diag. I keep going back and forth emotionally, listening to my grandma's voicemails and sporadically experiencing the various stages of grief. 

You didn't know how close we were and how much she meant to me. But you didn't need to know that to treat me with compassion. You offered extensions, yes, but also genuine condolences. Several of you wrote fairly long emails. One of you even talked to me about losing your own grandmother when *you* were a student, describing how it was ""incredibly hard, to lose a grandmother at a distance, without the usual ways of connecting and feeling present to process the loss with others."" I think you hit the nail on the head with that one. 

It will take a while for the grief to pass, but in the meantime, thank you for understanding. Thank you for giving me the past week/weekend to Zoom my family instead of you, look at pictures instead of Canvas, and discuss memories instead of lecture notes. 

People have experienced so many different types of losses from COVID-19. Like many others, I've felt financial loss, the loss of a ""normal"" college experience, and now, the loss of a loved one. I've seen the posts by other students this semester and witnessed in the past how strict some professors can be. Quite honestly, I wasn't sure what to expect when I emailed you, but I'm very glad I did. 

It's professors like you that make me say ""go blue."" Thank you."

Two bystanders came over and asked me if I was okay and I was trying REALLY hard to pretend like I wasn't in immense pain. Maybe I'm pathetic but I legit felt like I couldn't use my legs.

Anyways I was carrying this massive box with my prototypes inside and one of the guys offered to carry it into the studio. I accepted and to my surprise he took it all the way to the classroom I reserved, and it was a pretty long walk! I was assuming he was just gonna get it through the front door smth

Just a nice little moment I wanted to share. I grew up in AA and everyone praises it for being so welcoming but I always felt as though that strangers are a little... cold. Maybe it's just a suburbia thing.

The only advantage I see from living here is being really close to central campus, but this is made irrelevant due to the pandemic. Sure, this was unforeseeable, but let me tell you why you should NOT live at Z Place. This is a long list of problems, so TL;DR this place sucks; think twice before moving here.

* I'm living with 3 other roommates on floor 2 on the shady side of the building. We get less than 1 hour of sunlight everyday. Also due to this we have to have more lights turned on at as early as 4 pm just to keep the living room lit. We still pay the same rent and electricity rates as everyone else.
    - Of course, this might not be the case for other residents.
* On move-in day, my fire alarm was making a very loud beeping sound every minute (low battery?), 24 hours straight. It took them a week to fix. This happened again a few months later, which they again took another week. We had to tape sponges to the fire alarm just to be able to sleep.
* In September when I only had 2 roommates, another resident had to move in with us ""temporarily"" because ""something"" (possibly a water pump?) was ridiculously loud in his room when it activated. At first, they didn't believe him and refused to do anything until a technician were in the room for other reasons and the thing started. He ended up living with us for a month, because they can't locate the issue. We even had a 4 hour water cut so that they could fix things, but eventually Z Place just relocated him to Z West instead of getting it fixed.
* Shower drain. One of the bathrooms has no slanted floor or a ridge to keep the water from flowing out of the shower area. So every time someone showered in there, the floor would stay wet for a few hours unless they cleaned it. We bought a shower curtain but it didn't change anything, and we eventually had to place a row of rags next to the shower to absorb the water.
    - Also, from time to time it was impossible to get cold water from the shower. This got fixed after said water cut.
* Heating. All 4 bedrooms in my apartment has vastly different temperatures. Apparently our temporary roommate had this problem too, except in his apartment his unit was a lot hotter than the rest. I'm lucky enough to be in a room with moderate temperature, but the units that don't have windows are always inexplicably cold. So cold that my roommate had to turn on their own heater.
* ...Which brings me to electricity. Somehow, the microwave's electricity is grouped in the same switch as that roommate's bedroom. When his heater is on and anyone turns on the microwave for more than 30 seconds, his bedroom (+microwave) switch trips. This doesn't happen with the oven, which is also electric. Why should anything in the common area be grouped to someone's bedroom??
* Bad WiFi. The WiFi disconnects daily and randomly for no apparent reasons. This continued to happen even _after_ they put in a new router.
* There is a large machine labeled ""GENERAC"" just outside our window that turns on **every single Thursday** from 10 am to 11 am. When it turns on, it is VERY LOUD and my floor &amp; bed vibrates with it, so it's impossible to sleep. Sure, I should probably wake up earlier but even if I'm awake it is very distracting. In addition, a few weeks ago it turned on for 5 minutes at 6 am. I don't know why this thing has to turn on or who controls it.
* Noise from neighbors. The floor above us partied nearly every weekend and sometimes even on weekday nights up to as late as 2 am, playing very loud music and making other loud noises. We asked Z Place to tell them to stop, but didn't file a complaint. Pretty much nothing changed, except a few days ago, when **we received a ""Noise or Disturbance Violation"" email from them AND A FINE OF 50 DOLLARS**. WTF? Our apartment has never hosted a single party and our whole floor is quiet. Is it because we were nice enough to ask instead of filing an complaint, while the rest of the floor filed noise complaints, so they think it's us?? Taking the blame for somebody else's noise is outrageous.
    - Edit: apparently the email was for an apartment on the 4th floor but was accidentally sent to everyone, but I guess they can't even be bothered to apologize and correct it. No fines were charged to us.

The list goes on but you get the point. Don't live here. It's just not worth it."

I ask because the other day, I  introduced myself to a girl in Mojo dining hall. I saw her  sitting alone and I walked up to her. It felt like love at first sight.

I  said my name and we started talking about our majors and that typical  stuff. but I couldn't think of how to keep the conversation going at one  point. I pulled out my phone and asked if she wanted to see my  vegetable garden from my hometown. She nodded and I started going  through pics. I started it a few years ago and was really proud of my   basil and tomatoes especially. I think she was really interested and I  thought she really liked me and she was pretty too so i asked her ""Do  you want to date?"" and she said ""ummm no im sorry."" I felt really  awkward so I just apologized and said bye.

This has kinda shattered my confidence and I can't stop thinking about it.

Has anyone else had their confidence shattered at U of M in a similar manner? More importantly, does anyone on campus have a vegetable garden I could use? I want to be able to refine my gardening skills while on campus, as my basil and tomato display was clearly not impressive enough."

The news struck me so hard since she was a life-changing teacher for me. Before transfering to michigan, I never thought about studying pure math, but in the last semester at my previous institution, her teaching and passion made me realize how beautiful this subject can be and I switched to math major at UM.

What distressed me the most is the sudden and unexpected nature of the whole event. Everything happened after she was diagnosed a few weeks ago. I never thought this would have happened cuz she was so young as a scholar and energetic and passionate and all the memories with her were so real and close. In this summer, I even saw her virtually visiting UM math department to give grad students lectures on random matrices. I took both her and her husband's classes and enjoyed both. There are photos of them and their children on their teaching websites. For me, she was a model of academic brilliance and domestic devotion. This fall semester she and her family were at the university of oxford to be a visiting professor. And now I cant imagine how devastated her husband and children were on a foreign land. It is just hard to believe that all of a sudden everything's changed forever.

I have been extremely stressful since I saw the news and tried to look for mental services. Never since the start of covid had I felt so upset and disturbed by the fact that someone I loved and respected might leave me forever unanticipated. Also as an international student I haven't seen my family for a year and expect that I will not be able to see them at least till next summer or even 2022. I live alone in my apartment since my roommate moved out two months ago. I just went through several finals and am still waitlisting for classes for the winter semester. All these factors are pushing me to the brink of a mental breakdown. But the school mental services had stopped with the fall semester ending, so I will appreciate it if anyone could give me some advice on coping with the distress or finding other mental services. Thank you!"

Important to add that I of course am not calling out everyone who goes to this school, and I've mostly managed to escape the groups that do this type of shit. But they exist here, and are in very prevalent numbers and make up large social circles on this campus. I sort of attempted to say this a while ago, someone showed up and just derailed the whole thing because they  needed to make themselves look good by making this all about them and their perception of my actions. Please don't make this about me. I am sharing my perspective, but I am trying to speak for the larger non-upper class and racial minority groups who have to deal with so much discomfort, feelings of displacement and inadequacy. Everyone feels that here, but we feel it especially, because we know coming in or we quickly become aware, of our disadvantaged position due to coming from such different environments than the literal majority of students attending the university.

 I'm Hispanic and if I say something that goes against many people here's  little theory of how I should think / feel about situations, I will get shameeedd like there's no tomorrow. They act like they know what the hell it's like to go to schools in underfunded areas and have a shittier foundation because of it. They act like they are ""educated"" on the black experience or can tell people how to think about it just because they support BLM and know a thing or two about the platform. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then they are confused why things are harder for the more disadvantaged people academically  It sucks to see these upper class kids procrastinate like crazy and still succeed in many cases (not all). They are deliberate perfectionists. This is an issue in multiple departments, literally from EECS to Psychology. And when I joke about it telling them they don't need to be, , I've had two people respond to me by going ""Yeah, cause if I wasn't, I'd be afraid of failing classes like you, no offense."" 

They call me privileged because I think that discourse is a better way to solve discrimination rather than just yelling at people to stop hating certain people or outcasting them completely.  While they enjoy the benefits of being  say, LGBT and not nearly as hated as people would be in other parts of the world, because people before them engaged in discourse to educate others with power in this country. 

All of this and more just, makes me hate this school, hate that I'm here when I constantly deal with people like this (at least during my first year). Overall I'm still grateful, the school will open many doors and gave me the best FinAid deal possible that isn't GoBlue. But this school has a shit ton of bubble bursting to do. Sorry rant over."

After seeing this post after I left, I have been meaning to post about my  experience  as well but I am still quite shaken about it and only now have the courage to do so. Hopefully talking about it helps.

I am currently an undergrad in UofM and I have been dealing with depression for quick some time now. I have been trying to get my life back on track and I think it was going well. I have recently been talking to a therapist and they recommended me to talk to my primary care physician about taking anti-depressants and that's how this all started. To be clear, I am not suicidal and at the very worst, serverely depressed with an idealization of suicide. I have never hurt myself or others nor plan to.

I made an appointment to my PCP that I have been seeing since I was a child which was not a good idea in hindsight. They specialize in family care and were just unprepared for what I was asking of them. When I had told them about my depression, they had me stay in the room as they called the hospital to get me transferred. I had to get escorted by police because they did not trust me to get there on my own. 

Once I arrived, I had to wait to get admitted for about 2 hours because they were so busy. When I actually did get admitted, I had to give them everything and wait for a psychiatrist to come evaluate me. That took another couple hours. When they finally came, they asked me a couple of questions that lasted about 3 minutes. The questions were things like ""How long have you been depressed?"" ""Do you think about killing yourself?"" ""How would you do it?"" I answered truthfully but I really wish I didn't. I had told them 3 years, yes, and I guess I would go into a closed garage with my car running. After this, they left for another couple of hours. I kept on asking what was happening and when I could go. The nurses said I had to keep waiting for the psychiatrist. After many hours they came back and said I had to stay as I was deemed a risk to myself and others. Unfortunately, my insurance didn't cover this hospital so they were trying to transfer me to somewhere else that would. They had no idea how long this would take so I was just forced to wait. It took 3 days. 3 Days of nothing but just laying in a bed while someone watched me, making sure I don't do anything. I felt myself going insane, just trying to make the time go by. I was given only a word search and an xbox with no games (so useless) on the second day and finally a book and a switch with an actual game on the third day but only hours before I left. At this point, my anxiety was sky high and was shaking at the fear of staying any longer. I felt so relieved getting transfered, just hoping I can go back home later that day.

I was driven to a holding ground of sorts, where they evaluate you before sending you to another hospital. I was really hoping I could convince them I was not a danger and to let me go with what I originally wanted, some medication. I was allowed my stuff back so I was getting in contact with my family  and updating them on what was happening and my plans on leaving. After talking to the staff, I figured out why I was not allowed to leave. The psychiatrist that had seen me for 3 minutes had concluded that I was suicidal with the intent to asphyxia myself. They had concluded that I am unwell and can no longer make medical decisions for myself. I was told if the doctor in the new facility did not agree, I could have them override the decision and let me go. I talked to the doctor, told them my situation, and was confident that I would be let go. After some time, I ask the staff what the decision was. It was for me to get hospitalized again. I pleaded to talk to the doctor again and kept asking all the staff what I could do. It was already around 8pm and they had said I was the last to see the doctor for the day. They said it was a close decision but the doctor ultimately listened to the previous doctors recommendation. I kept asking about other options, about my rights, about  involuntary stay and so on. I was basically told that I have no rights and there was nothing I could do.  I knew for a fact that I had rights but I didn't know what they were. After a while, I was pulled aside by one of the staff and was told to basically stop being difficult and that there was nothing I could do but accept it. At this point, I was so full of anxiety, fear, and rage. I felt like I was just being ignored and that the staff didn't give a single shit about me. They just wanted me to shut up and go with it. I really melt down after this.

This is when I was finally admitted to a psych ward at 2am. I still hadn't given up and kept asking everyone there what my options are. The nurse there straight up told me that there was really nothing I could do, and the best thing I could do was just go with it as well. They said if I act out, they would keep me there. If I don't take the meds that they prescribe, they would keep me there. If I try to take the legal route, they would keep me there. There was nothing but try to act as normal as possible and be discharged in another 5-7 days. I thought I could maybe go through the legal route but after asking about a ITT (intent to terminate treatment) form, I was immediately threatened by a nurse to sign another involuntary admission form which would force me to stay at least 3 more days. I had given up hope and just wished I could just escape to my friends and family. The doctors there were also no help. When meeting with one, he first talked about another patient in front of me in closed doors to another colleague but I guess I could listen. When he finished, he had asked me if I was korean or chinese or what? I answered chinese american and he proceeded to go off on china, assuming I would be fine with it because I was american. He made comments such as ""Chinese health care is one bullet to the head"" and so on. I could do nothing but agree and nod. This doctor was in control of the meds I was being forced to take or else I would be there forever. For the rest of the days, I was just trying to seem as sane as possible while shaking with anxiety, with the most fear I have ever felt in my life, and with nothing but a wall phone to connect me to the outside world. 

When I was finally discharged, I had just sped through everything, saying I was perfectly fine, that I improved and am all better. In reality, I never felt so much anxiety, I have never felt so much fear, and I have never been so fucked up. They had told me to continue with the medication but I realize after that they never asked for my pharmacy nor gave me a prescription. I was discharged feeling far worse than I ever have before and with no meds that I was trying to get in the first place. It has been a week and I still get anxiety attacks that I have never had before, I keep waking up from nightmares about being kept there forever. I was trying to get better but was left with all this, no meds, and a huge distrust of the health industry. I haven't been able to even look at school work since then and I don't know what to do now. I just hope I will get better but I know it won't be any time soon now."

""Celebrating the Class of 2021 with a virtual commencement ceremony""

Dear Graduating Students:

We know that many of you have been eagerly waiting for news about Spring Commencement. As we have seen over the past ten months, one of the difficult challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic has been the uncertainty that we have been forced to endure. We do not always know what measures will be needed to protect health and safety, here on campus and beyond, and that has made planning for major events such as commencement a much more ambiguous endeavor.

To help us plan, we surveyed and engaged in conversations with you, our graduating students. We learned that if we can't be in person for graduation, you want a virtual ceremony with synchronous content that allows the class to gather together at the same moment and includes many of the traditional elements of a University of Michigan commencement. You also asked that we announce the format as early as we can to provide as much time as possible for you and your families to plan.

In response to your great feedback and the ongoing public health challenges of the pandemic, U-M will hold a virtual commencement ceremony on Saturday, May 1 at noon.

We very much wish that we could hold a safe commencement in Michigan Stadium, along with the many other celebration activities that are a fundamental part of our community life and traditions. Commencement is the most joyous event of the academic year for many in our community, as we celebrate the accomplishments of our graduates and draw inspiration from the achievements they will share with our world.

The May 1 ceremony will include synchronous content and will be available for viewing later for those who can’t be there during the scheduled time. The most important element of a commencement, according to the survey responses from 4,500 graduating students, was to have a ceremony that included the conferring of your U-M degrees. Our commencement will feature that important rite of passage prominently. We’re also working to provide virtual performances, host interactive elements, and bring in an inspiring main speaker.

As more information is finalized, we’ll post it to our main [commencement](http://commencement.umich.edu/) site. Our plan for virtual ceremonies also applies to the Rackham Graduate Exercises and the different types of graduation events held by organizations, student groups and most of our Ann Arbor schools and colleges.

In addition, we are pleased to invite all graduates who missed out on an in-person ceremony due to COVID-19 to attend and participate in any future main commencement of their choosing. They and their families will be our honored guests at these ceremonies, and the graduates will be recognized not just for the completion of their degrees, but also for their resilience and fortitude in persevering during these challenging times. We’re also continuing to consider options for inviting graduates from this year’s class and the Class of 2020 back to campus for special future in-person celebrations.

We still do not know what public health measures will need to be in place in May to hold events like commencement. Currently, we remain under prudent restrictions on gathering sizes, and it’s impossible to predict factors such as infection and vaccination rates, travel guidelines and when state and local limits on gatherings may change. Many different scenarios for a ceremony were considered, along with the feedback our students expressed in our [commencement survey](https://commencement.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Report-on-2021-Commencement-survey.pdf), conversations we’ve had with students over the last few months, and consultations with campus public health experts.

Thank you for your patience and understanding. We join you in the hope for better days ahead, as we celebrate the University of Michigan Class of 2021.

Sincerely,

Mark S. Schlissel  
President

I'm a sophomore in DS-Eng, but I'm currently on a leave from college under mandatory enlistment duty from my home country. Up until sophomore year, I basically took the CS core classes Data Science requires (EECS 183, 280, 203) with only a few other electives (MATH 215, STATS 425, etc.). I enjoyed the classes I took so far, and am looking forward to upper level CS/Stats classes. My rationale in choosing DS over CS was because I wasn't (and still am not) entirely sure what kind of career path I'd like to take, and I thought a DS degree would offer me a little bit more flexibility over the CS one. My current plan is to work for a few years after I graduate and attend grad school, but I'm not entirely sure yet. 

However, recently I've been hearing that a major in Data Science as an undergrad is practically useless, as you'd need at least a Master's in Data Science to apply for AI/ML jobs, and all the other jobs you can take out there as an undergrad mostly prefer a CS degree over a DS degree. CS/DS majors, is this true? If so, what are some other perks of being a DS major over a CS major? I'd really love to hear from upperclassmen/graduates in DS/CS -- I'm really lost right now lol. 

Thanks in advance! If you've commented, you're the best, and I hope your day goes awesome."

Every time I finish one task, two more pop up. I feel like I’m not making any progress and we’re only halfway through the semester.

I’ve been struggling with social anxiety for a few years now, but it’s never been something I couldn’t handle. Since covid began, I’ve been spending most of my time along and currently live at home, not on campus. This has worsened my social anxiety incredibly. 

I find it extremely difficult to log onto my classes or club meetings each day, and I try super hard not to speak. When I do speak, my anxiety feels so strong that I have trouble putting my words together and to say something meaningful. I sound so unintelligent compared to my peers. 

When I think about returning to campus next year, I get sick. I will be living in a co-op, which I was excited for, but now I’m really really scared about the social situation there. I’m scared my social anxiety will continue to debilitate me even after I’ve returned to campus.  

I’m not going to write too much more of my symptoms because I don’t need to. I know I should get help. I’m not able to find a therapist right now as I’m living at home and simply cannot afford one. I was thinking about CAPS but I heard they aren’t much of a help. Does anyone who struggled with anxiety before have any advice?"

My name is Cheyanne, and I'm about to graduate from UMich. My freshman year, I fell in love with Quickie Burger (to this day, it is the best burger I've ever had). Something about their spice blend recipe and the secret sauce just absolutely blew me away and I fell in love. Coming back the next year, I was so saddened to learn that the owner had silently closed the restaurant's doors over the summer, and since then... I've told every family member, friend, and acquaintance I have about the mystical Quickie Burger. 

In the last few months, I've found myself once again craving a Quickie Burger. However, due to the development of chronic illnesses, I have some significant dietary restrictions... so even if someone could magically re-open the store, I couldn't buy one. My body doesn't tolerate red meat anymore. 

That being said, has anyone on this subreddit worked at Quickie in the past and still know the recipe (even a little bit)? I'd love to re-make it at home, within the scope of my restrictions, and I would give ANYTHING for my friends, my partner, and my family to be able to give it a try. I'd cherish that recipe forever and pass it down from generation to generation. I realized that this is likely my last hope, as I'll be leaving town in July for grad school.

In 2008, one recent graduate complained to the university that Mr. Conforth, a lecturer in the American Culture Department, had propositioned her when she was a student. The university put him on formal notice but quietly resolved the complaint. Two more women came forward, though, in 2016, to report that Mr. Conforth had worked to engage them in sexual relationships when they were his students, and, in the midst of the university’s investigation, he agreed to quietly leave his faculty position.

Now six former Michigan undergraduates — the three women who previously complained and three others — have filed court papers announcing their intention to sue him and the university, asserting he engaged in a litany of sexual misconduct and the school failed to protect them.

“He should have been fired,” said Isabelle Brourman, one of the women. “But they allowed him to thrive. They allowed him to win awards.”"""

I'm aware of classes like EECS 373, 470, and 270, but I'm slightly concerned that not being in the college of engineering and taking classes like EECS 215 would hinder my learning experience.

1. Palio of MainStreet Ventures is by far the worst management I have ever worked under. There is blatant disrespect among the interpersonal relationships between staff and managers. Every question is met with condescension or downright aggression. Brittani Sturgeon has got to be one of the worst GMs I have ever worked with for my last five years of being in the restaurant business. She is rude, unorganized, and has this ridiculous Alpha Female complex going on with her. It is extremely unattractive and as proof, a recent long time manager has transferred restaurants, several employees are quitting as well. Almost every shift I've worked has been short staffed. Among 98% of the staff, other than those benefiting from blatant favoritism, store mountains of resentment for this woman. She singlehandedly created the most toxic work environment I've ever encountered. Honestly, it is impressive.

I haven't said anything to anyone because I'm scared to lose my job. Staff shouldn't be scared to speak their minds and offer improvements. Staff also shouldn't be subjected to rudeness and being spoken to as if they were children.

Let me be clear: working at other MSV restaurants is great! Upper management is very lovely and understanding of the needs of its employees. I would recommend working at Palio only if Miss Sturgeon's behavior improves, or if she is removed from MSV entirely.

Please add other workplaces or feel free to comment on this one! I'd like to see her exposed and removed from Palio so it can be a nice place to work again.

I'm an incoming international freshman in the college of LSA who is planning to major in economics and/or political science. Recently I started researching about the undergraduate program at Ford School of Public Policy and I feel like the public policy major there is really interesting considering my interest in the social sciences in general and the public sector. The major is interdisciplinary and being in Ford as a small undergraduate cohort sounds like I'll have more personal attention and more resources.

Though it also looks like admissions to the program are pretty competitive during the sophomore year. I'd be happy if current students in the program or those who know about the program can help me with some of the questions I have:

1- What kind of courses should I take in my first two years to prepare for the program? I think there aren't requirements to apply for the major but I am guessing some prior knowledge definitely helps with the required courses for the public policy major.

2- What do they look for in the applicants/what makes a difference in the applications?

3- I am sure I'll have time to explore my interests (also career wise) during my first two years and this will probably be one of the factors while deciding to apply to the program. But I'm also wondering if I can work in the private sector after graduating. Overall, what kind of careers can I pursue?

4- Lastly, but more importantly, I wonder what you feel about the program. What were your experiences like? Are you happy? What do you feel about the opportunities and did you do any internships?

Sorry this is a little long. I think the formal descriptions on the website are not as valuable as current students' or graduates' personal experiences. I'd be very happy if I can hear what you have to say.

Thanks!!!"

ngu0af,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/ngu0af/coe_incoming_firstyear_questions_about_course/,CoE incoming first-year questions about course,1,10,2021-05-20 00:45:51,"Hello! Since orientation and course selection is gonna be coming up soon, I had a few questions to ask before the 15-20 minutes I get with my advisor. Not sure what my major will be, but rn I'm interested in aero, mecheng, and data sci. I also want to get a French minor if I get a 4/5 on the AP test or place into the Advanced French course since I'm not sure how many french classes my schedule can actually handle.

First questions: what reason would someone have for taking an honors physics or math course? I've heard that the curve is pretty nice but would the extra work in the class (at least I assume there would be extra/harder work) really be worth it? Just wondering since I'm usually pretty good with understanding math quickly, so honors calc 3 and diff equa might be the way to go. Physics is a different story tho lmao. Btw I took Calc BC this year, and I've gotten a 5 on all of the full practice tests we've taken so far, so I don't anticipate having to take calc 1&amp;2 again.

Also for the math sequence, what order would you recommend taking required math courses in? Sample schedules show it as calc 3 --&gt; diff equa --&gt; lin algebra, but I've hard that it's easier to just take diff equa before calc 3. I didn't check to see if calc 3 is a prereq to diff equa so that might just answer my question, but if not how did you feel about the order?

I took a dual enrollment of the equivalent of Physics 140/141 this past semester at a community college, but quite honestly, I feel like I genuinely learned nothing. I got a lot of help on p-sets from other classmates and friends in college, and the test was basically just p-set Qs with different numbers so it was easy to copy and translate work with little to no mental gymnastics involved. If you gave me every single unit we studied and asked me to do one problem from each, I think I would only be able to solve something with kinematic equations and basic vector calc questions, besides basic stuff like the integral of acceleration is velocity and whatnot lmao. I really feel bad not learning anything from it and want to retake it in the winter semester (I dropped AP chem cuz the teacher was trash online so I have to take it in Fall), but I always see people say how bad physics at umich is and now I'm kinda scared to take it again if I don't have to. I'm just really conflicted between ""easier first-year courses"" and ""actually learning something."" So what opinion would you have on taking the course again?

What benefits/drawbacks would there be to making an elective course pass/fail instead of graded? I assume it doesn't count towards your GPA and makes the self-enforced quality of your work a little less strict compared to a graded course since you could effectively get a C and end up with no consequences. Is there anything that would make you not want to do that if given the option, though?

Also, I'm looking at the schedule builder on Atlas and I think I have a pretty good scheduled lined up besides for 2 courses scheduled back to back on the same days. I would end up having calc 3 in east hall and french in east quad right after each other with no scheduled breaks. I looked at the campus map and the two buildings seem really close, but would the built-in break after calc be enough time for me to walk/bus/bike over there easily? For reference, I usually walk a 15 minute mile lol.

Last question, I swear. Which section of ENGR 100 did you take and would you recommend it? If not, did you have any friends or know of anyone that really loved a different section and would recommend that one? There are too many interesting options for me to make a decision by myself when they all would fit into my schedule one way or another, and my friends are sick of hearing about engineering things lmao.

Basically I'll be a sophomore this upcoming fall semester and I applied to be an RA which is why I didn't look for any apartments or anything. To be safe, I did fill out the housing application just in case but I've heard that housing on-campus is not guaranteed for sophomores and up.

RA decisions are rolling out starting today but I'm getting more and more nervous that I won't get the job since I'm only a sophomore. If I don't then I'll have to pay a significant amount of money to live in a dorm and I don't know how financially feasible that will be for my family. I've tried looking at apartments but I don't know anyone that I can room with and I'm not sure if I can even find a place in time.

I came in thinking astrophysics but had a bad prof, somehow stumbling into a double major in comm/ftvm the next semester. Which I absolutely adore, don't get me wrong. I told myself for the past two years that finding a decent job after graduating wouldn't be too big of an issue, especially with also being vocationally certified in graphic design and minoring in French, but now I'm not so sure.

This unsurety, of course, has been worsened over the years by other people telling me I'm not going to be able to do anything with my degree, but has recently been even more complicated when I found out I have ADHD and Autism from doing psych testing as a 21yo adult.

At first, I was really happy to know at long last that there was never really anything wrong with me and that I was just different. But even that is complicated by this huge sense of anger and grief, that my entire life could have been better and maybe I wouldn't have failed/dropped out of so many classes at uni had someone, anyone, seen the blatantly obvious signs when I was younger and just. did something about it.

I'm fully aware that this isn't anything special and that it happens to so many people, especially women like me, even at much later points in their lives as well, but I can't help but feel like it shouldn't have to, and with a love for all things psych as well I'm wondering now if I should make the move towards exploring that. Someone needs to make this more aware, to offer help and treatment and understanding from a neurodivergent perspective, and honestly I'd love to do that but from where I'm standing I have no idea how.

I've learned a little bit about non-traditional med school applicants but I can't help but feel that they wouldn't look twice at me, especially with how poorly I've done in undergrad (which is abt a 3.2ish I believe currently so it's not even that bad, just bad in terms of moving on up to even higher education). And that was in a BA, not a BS.

I'm not even sure where'd I'd do if not med school--can you go to grad school for a master's in psychology or psychiatry? I'm not even sure if this is the right sub to post in but here I am. Any help would be greatly appreciated."

There is water leaking from machines and dirty cloth, papers, and strings of fabric and hair laying everywhere. Also the laundry app works like garbage and locked be out of my account with $10 on it, and the washing machines do not have an option to refund your coins prior to clicking start (In case you want to change machines once you realize someone left a gallon of bleach in the detergent tray, but I'll get to that). Additionally, some people here are just totally incapable of minding other people's experience. Why would you empty a whole load of fabric softener and bleach into the washing machines? You know a lot of it stays there right? And I guess some people aren't familiar with the concept of timing how long it takes for your clothes to finish washing/drying since it doesn't matter that other people are waiting to do laundry. I'd be surprised if the laundry room doesn't implode by next week at the rate things are going. Similarly, the bathrooms, despite being cleaned daily, are being used by people who act like animals. Urine and hair on the seats, not flushing turds, mystery suds in the shower, clogged drains full of hair, etc. Act like normal people! Do you piss on the seat in your own house?!

Initially I was very skeptical of coming here because of the tuition. My family were having a debate for weeks about whether I should go to UMich or an in-state, lower ranked college. While the insane tuition is still not justified imo, the social and academic environment I've experienced makes me feel like I'm getting **at least some value.**

I made a lot of new friends which tbh is something money can't buy. I've participated in way more outdoor activities than before. I mean, granted, I could get all the social ""wellness"" even in an in-state college, but since UMich has way more international students, I did get better exposure to cultures so there's that.

If I could get my hands onto some unique research projects through UROP or other means (by unique I mean a study that you really can't get elsewhere due to funding/resources/equipment), then I'll **feel slightly better about the stuff I'm paying for.**

While classes is like the whole point of college, ironically, I don't feel like I'm getting any academic value for the extra 20k yearly tuition. This is knowledge you can get in any higher-education institution.

Any more tips to getting the biggest bang for your buck?"

I am pretty much planning on maxing out my 18 credits every semester I am here, seeing that I am already paying for it.

To keep the workload manageable and keep up a decent GPA I might pass/fail some of those credits that I really am just taking for fun/learning. For example, an elective I am taking this semester has a final 8-page essay worth 25%, which I would love to skip without getting a B seeing that I have four other finals to worry about.

The average was a 62%, so even with the curve that’s still a D. I mean is it even possible to recover to a B from that? I’ve never had a worse academic experience in my life. I can’t drop Orgo because then I’d be in less than 12 credit hours and I wouldn’t be a full time student. I just feel like now I’ll only be able to get a C or D in the class which will rank my gpa and grad school aspirations. My mental health has already been kinda shitty this year but at this point I’m seriously just considering offing myself. I can’t cope with this shit. I feel like I’m literally falling apart and ruining my life. Any advice???"

This post is half asking for support, and half asking for advice.

At the beginning of the semester, I was so busy trying to find my classes and meet new people that I didn't really have the mental bandwidth to feel homesick. I've kind of settled into a routine though, and homesickness has started to set in.

I was planning on commiserating with my roommate about it, but he's in-state. Like, his house is 10 minutes away from our dorm, he's got a bunch of high school friends here, and he's pretty familiar with the city, so I don't think he's feeling super homesick rn

This isn't my first time being away from home (I did a pre-college residential program in the summer of 2019 specifically to get used to being on my own), but this is the longest I've ever been away, and it's also the furthest away I've ever been

Anyone have tips for keeping homesickness at bay? It's not terrible or anything, but it's not fun either. What I've been doing is just staying so busy that I don't have time to dwell on it and regularly messaging old friends/family"

One of my primary concerns is FOMO for the OSU game… is it worth coming back early to make it to the game? I have season tickets already but Im not sure if any of my friends would be coming to the game with me. Because of this, I didn’t want to fly home on Tuesday and come back Friday to make it to the game, so I thought I could go from Friday-Friday (would have to skip Mon/Tues classes). Alternatively, I could go to classes Monday and Tuesday, leave on Tuesday and come back Sunday, missing the game but making it to classes and staying home longer. Though I don’t want to come back for the game and have a bad time being on my own. 

Maybe Im just overthinking it but wanted to hear somebody else’s opinion before booking my tickets. Thanks :)"

- I have a very old HP laptop (8 years)
- I’ve been on campus for 3 semesters now and it has never once recognized MWireless as a wifi (doesn’t show up in the wifi list, MSetup tool leads to eduroam)
- Eduroam usually works pretty well, but will randomly cut out and won’t reconnect until I redownload the ITS wifi setup tool
- It’s gotten worse lately and has been unable to connect to eduroam for 4 days straight. When I download the setup tool, it goes straight to no wifi and then disconnects from eduroam
- For some reason, it works perfectly well with my apartment wifi (xfinity). I’ve never had a problem connecting/losing wifi 

I went to the tech consulting desk today and they were unable to find a solution and recommended I buy a new laptop.

I'm considering taking PolSci 101 next semester to have a relatively easier course in my schedule and also to learn more about the political theories.

However, I still want to do the readings and I'm wondering how much time it typically takes every week. I'm asking this because right now I'm thinking about also taking Calc 3, Econ 401, and Hist 195 (writing seminar) and I'm pretty sure especially calc and econ are gonna devour my time so I'm having second thoughts.

These Real Estate and Oil Tycoons Avoided Paying Taxes for Years

[https://www.propublica.org/article/these-real-estate-and-oil-tycoons-used-paper-losses-to-avoid-paying-taxes-for-years](https://www.propublica.org/article/these-real-estate-and-oil-tycoons-used-paper-losses-to-avoid-paying-taxes-for-years)

Here's some quotes from the ProPublica piece:

&gt;Here’s a tale of two Stephen Rosses.  
&gt;  
&gt;Real life Stephen Ross, who founded Related Companies, a global firm best known for developing the Time Warner Center and Hudson Yards in Manhattan, was a massive winner between 2008 and 2017. He became the second-wealthiest real estate titan in America, almost doubling his net worth over those years, according to Forbes Magazine’s annual list, by adding $3 billion to his fortune.   
&gt;  
&gt;Then there's the other Stephen Ross, the big loser. That's the one depicted on his tax returns. Though the developer brought in some $1.5 billion in income from 2008 to 2017, he reported even more -- nearly $2 billion -- in losses.  
&gt;  
&gt;\--------  
&gt;  
&gt; ProPublica’s analysis of more than 15 years of secret tax data for thousands of the wealthiest Americans shows that Ross is one of a special breed.   
&gt;  
&gt;He is among a subset of the ultrarich who take advantage of owning businesses that generate enormous tax deductions that then flow through to their personal tax returns.  
&gt;  
&gt;\--------  
&gt;  
&gt; A spokesperson for Ross declined to accept questions. In a statement, he said, “Stephen Ross has always followed the tax law. His returns — which were illegally obtained and descriptions of which were released by ProPublica — are reflective of and in accordance with federal tax policy. It should terrify every American that their information is not safe with the government and that media will act illegally in disseminating it. We will have no further correspondence with you as we believe this is an illegal act.”   
&gt;  
&gt;\--------  
&gt;  
&gt;Then, with a $10,000 loan from his mother, Ross went into business for himself, selling tax shelters.   
&gt;  
&gt;\--------  
&gt;  
&gt; Despite his growing fortune, Ross often owed no federal income tax. In the 22 years from 1996 to 2017, he paid no federal income taxes 12 times. His largest tax bill came in 2006, when he owed $12.6 million after reporting just over $100 million in income.   
&gt;  
&gt; In the years since, Ross has used a combination of business losses, tax credits and other deductions to sidestep such bills. In 2016, for example, Ross reported $306 million in income, including $219 million in capital gains, $51 million in interest income and $5 million in wages from his role at Related Companies. But he was able to offset that income entirely with losses, including by claiming $271 million in losses through his business activities that year and by tapping his reserve of losses from prior years.   
&gt;  
&gt;\--------  
&gt;  
&gt; He has made a series of multimillion-dollar contributions to his alma mater, the University of Michigan, which have earned him naming rights to its business school and some of its sports facilities. In 2003, a partnership owned by Ross and his business partners donated part of a stake in a southern California property to the school, taking a $33 million tax deduction in exchange. But when the university sold the stake two years later, it got only $1.9 million for it.

I feel like I don’t hear of many people ever doing that and I’m wondering if landlords will oftentimes write a clause against it in the lease. 
I wouldn’t mind sharing a room with someone, especially if it brought my rent from 900 to 450 (or ~500/550) but just want to know if it’s common for people to do so."
rbvj6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/rbvj6j/spanish_103/,Spanish 103?,3,14,2021-12-08 08:52:39,What would you say the workload is for this class? I have a couple years of high school experience but part of that was during covid and my school didn’t have a very good Spanish department. I feel like I know the very basics of the language but I’d definitely need to review before going into the class. Is it a good idea to start the class rusty or should I wait until next fall and review over the summer? I’m taking physics 150/151 and I just want to make sure the sheer amount of work I’m given to do and the number of classes I’m going to have (3 mon-th and 2 fri) will still give me time to get done what I need to outside of class.

EECS 280

Physics 140/141

Math 214 (Linear Algebra)

CLCIV 372 (HU credit)

There are also 2 clubs I would like to join, MRun (running club) and WolverineSoft (game dev club)

My advisor told me I might want to think about only taking the first 3 courses (13 credits total) and fulfill my HU req later since EECS 280, math 214, and physics 140/141 are already pretty hard and have a decent workload. I was just wondering if anyone had any advice for me/with any of these classes/clubs. Would it be better to drop the HU class and take it later, would that set me behind at all? Would it be too much to take those 17 credits and try and be in 2 clubs?

Any advice is appreciated!"

I've been having a bit of a breakdown all semester and ended up completely forgetting to turn in a lab report until it was already graded and impossible to submit for late points, which has lead to my demise. I thought I could pull through on the last quiz but that was an utter disaster. If I get 100% on the last two labs (which is actually impossible despite me being able to snap my fingers and get an A in CHEM 211) I'll still be at a miserable 69.something%. 

I tried emailing my GSI for advise who forwarded me to my professor who then forwarded me to someone in advising I think? Who I haven't heard back from. 

I'm just having a bit of a breakdown (again). I just applied for late P/F but I feel like I'm going to fail regardless and if that's the case I want to drop the class and take the W even after a whole semester of work being put into it. I know this class ends up being curved, but I don't know how much that will really help me. 

What is your experience with the CHEM 216 curve? Do you think it can save me? Should I just drop? Thanks :,)))

I'm already signed up for 115 but obviously have the option to drop. For some background: I already took 105 this semester and that was not too bad for me. I did not take calc at all in high school. I am looking to apply to the Business Minor (not sure if this would be a big negative).

&amp;#x200B;

I want to take it at Washtenaw, but at the same time I wonder if this would impact the Business Minor admissions or even business grad school. I also hear about the horror stories of Michigan Math and I'll be honest 105 was just unnecessarily work heavy at times."
